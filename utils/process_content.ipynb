      "The motion of a rigid object can be analyzed as the translational motion of the\n",
      "object's center of mass, plus rotational motion about its center of mass (Section 7-8).\n",
      "We have already discussed translational motion in detail, so now we focus on\n",
      "purely rotational motion. By purely rotational motion we mean that all points in\n",
      "the object move in circles, such as the point P in the rotating wheel of Fig. 8-1,\n",
      "and that the centers of these circles all lie on one line called the axis of rotation.\n",
      "In Fig. 8-1 the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the page and passes through\n",
      "point O.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every point in an object rotating about a fixed axis moves in a circle (shown\n",
      "dashed in Fig. 8-1 for point P) whose center is on the axis of rotation and whose\n",
      "radius is r, the distance of that point from the axis of rotation. A straight line\n",
      "drawn from the axis to any point in the object sweeps out the same angle 0 in the\n",
      "same time interval.\n",
      "\n",
      "To indicate the angular position of a rotating object, or how far it has rotated,\n",
      "we specify the angle 0 of some particular line in the object (red in Fig. 8-1) with\n",
      "respect to a reference line, such as the x axis in Fig. 8-1. A point in the object,\n",
      "such as P in Fig. 8-1, moves through an angle 0 when it travels the distance l\n",
      "measured along the circumference of its circular path. Angles are commonly\n",
      "measured in degrees, but the mathematics of circular motion is much simpler if\n",
      "we use the radian for angular measure. One radian (abbreviated rad) is defined\n",
      "as the angle subtended by an arc whose length is equal to the radius. For\n",
      "example, in Fig. 8-1b, point P is a distance r from the axis of rotation, and it has\n",
      "moved a distance & along the arc of a circle. The arc length l is said to \"subtend\"\n",
      "the angle 0. In radians, any angle 0 is given by\n",
