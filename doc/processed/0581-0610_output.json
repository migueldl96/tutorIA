These rocks were called "magnets" after their place of discovery.\nNot until the nineteenth century, however, was it seen that magnetism and\nelectricity are closely related. A crucial discovery was that electric currents produce\nmagnetic effects (we will say "magnetic fields") like magnets do. All kinds of\npractical devices depend on magnetism, from compasses to motors, loudspeakers,\ncomputer memory, and electric generators.\n20-1 Magnets and Magnetic Fields\nYou probably have observed a magnet attract paper clips, nails, and other objects\nmade of iron, as in Fig. 20-1. Any magnet, whether it is in the shape of a bar or a\nhorseshoe, has two ends or faces, called poles, which is where the magnetic effect\nis strongest. If a bar magnet is suspended from a fine thread, it is found that one\npole of the magnet will always point toward the north. It is not known for sure\nwhen this fact was discovered, but it is known that the Chinese were making\nuse of it as an aid to navigation by the eleventh century and perhaps earlier.\n560\n', 'chapter_title': '20-4 Force on an Electric Charge Moving in a Magnetic Field'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': "This is the principle of a compass. A compass needle is simply a bar magnet which\nis supported at its center of gravity so that it can rotate freely. The pole of a freely\nsuspended magnet that points toward geographic north is called the north pole of\nthe magnet. The other pole points toward the south and is called the south pole.\nIt is a familiar observation that when two magnets are brought near one another,\neach exerts a force on the other. The force can be either attractive or repulsive\nand can be felt even when the magnets don't touch. If the north pole of one bar\nmagnet is brought near the north pole of a second magnet, the force is repulsive.\nSimilarly, if the south poles are brought close, the force is repulsive. But when\nthe north pole of one magnet is brought near the south pole of another magnet,\nthe force is attractive. These results are shown in Fig. 20-2, and are reminiscent\nof the forces between electric charges: like poles repel, and unlike poles attract.\nBut do not confuse magnetic poles with electric charge. They are very different.\nOne important difference is that a positive or negative electric charge can easily\nbe isolated. But an isolated single magnetic pole has never been observed. If a\nbar magnet is cut in half, you do not obtain isolated north and south poles.\nInstead, two new magnets are produced, Fig. 20-3, each with north (N) and\nsouth (S) poles. If the cutting operation is repeated, more magnets are produced,\neach with a north and a south pole. Physicists have searched for isolated single\nmagnetic poles (monopoles), but no magnetic monopole has ever been observed.\nBesides iron, a few other materials, such as cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, and\nsome of their oxides and alloys, show strong magnetic effects. They are said to be\nferromagnetic (from the Latin word ferrum for iron). Other materials show some\nslight magnetic effect, but it is very weak and can be detected only with delicate\ninstruments. We will look in more detail at ferromagnetism in Section 20-12.\nIn Chapter 16, we used the concept of an electric field surrounding an electric\ncharge. In a similar way, we can picture a magnetic field surrounding a magnet. The\nforce one magnet exerts on another can then be described as the interaction between\none magnet and the magnetic field of the other. Just as we drew electric field lines, we\ncan also draw magnetic field lines. They can be drawn, as for electric field lines, so that\n1. the direction of the magnetic field is tangent to a field line at any point, and\n2. the number of lines per unit area is proportional to the strength of the\nmagnetic field.\nThe direction of the magnetic field at a given location can be defined as the\ndirection that the north pole of a compass needle would point if placed at that loca-\ntion. (We will give a more precise definition of magnetic field shortly.) Figure 20-4a\nshows how thin iron filings (acting like tiny magnets) reveal the magnetic field\nlines by lining up like the compass needles. The magnetic field determined in this\nway for the field surrounding a bar magnet is shown in Fig. 20-4b. Notice that\nbecause of our definition, the lines always point out from the north pole and in\ntoward the south pole of a magnet (the north pole of a magnetic compass needle\nis attracted to the south pole of the magnet).\nMagnetic field lines continue inside a magnet, as indicated in Fig. 20-4b.\nIndeed, given the lack of single magnetic poles, magnetic field lines always form\nclosed loops, unlike electric field lines that begin on positive charges and end on\nnegative charges.\nN\nS\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 20-1 A horseshoe magnet\nattracts pins made of iron.\nFIGURE 20-2 Like poles of two\nmagnets repel; unlike poles attract.\nS\nN\nN\nS\nRepulsive\nN\nS\nS\nN\nRepulsive\nN\nS\nN\nS\nAttractive\nCAUTION\nMagnets do not attract all metals\nFIGURE 20-3 If you split a magnet,\nyou won't get isolated north and\nsouth poles; instead, two new\nmagnets are produced, each with a\nnorth and a south pole.\nS\nN\nS\nN\nS\nN\nS NIS NS\nS NIS N\nCAUTION\nMagnetic field lines form closed\nloops, unlike electric field lines\nFIGURE 20-4 (a) Visualizing\nmagnetic field lines around a bar\nmagnet, using iron filings and\ncompass needles.

But its magnetic poles\nare not at the geographic poles (on\nthe Earth\'s rotation axis).\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nUse of a compass\nEarth\'s Magnetic Field\nThe Earth\'s magnetic field is shown in Fig. 20-5, and is thought to be produced\nby electric currents in the Earth\'s molten iron outer core. The pattern of field\nlines is almost as though there were an imaginary bar magnet inside the Earth.\nSince the north pole (N) of a compass needle points north, the Earth\'s magnetic\npole which is in the geographic north is magnetically a south pole, as indicated in\nFig. 20-5 by the S on the schematic bar magnet inside the Earth. Remember that\nthe north pole of one magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet.\nNonetheless, Earth\'s pole in the north is still often called the "north magnetic\npole," or "geomagnetic north," simply because it is in the north. Similarly, the\nEarth\'s southern magnetic pole, which is near the geographic south pole, is mag-\nnetically a north pole (N). The Earth\'s magnetic poles do not coincide with the\ngeographic poles, which are on the Earth\'s axis of rotation. The north magnetic\npole, for example, is in the Canadian Arctic, now on the order of 1000 km* from the\ngeographic north pole, or true north. This difference must be taken into account\nfor accurate use of a compass (Fig. 20-6). The angular difference between the\ndirection of a compass needle (which points along the magnetic field lines) at any\nlocation and true (geographical) north is called the magnetic declination. In the\nU.S. it varies from 0° to about 20°, depending on location.\nNotice in Fig. 20-5 that the Earth\'s magnetic field at most locations is not\ntangent to the Earth\'s surface. The angle that the Earth\'s magnetic field makes\nwith the horizontal at any point is referred to as the angle of dip, or the\n"inclination." It is 67° at New York, for example, and 55° at Miami.\nEXERCISE A Does the Earth\'s magnetic field have a greater magnitude near the poles\nor near the equator?

A perfectly uniform field over a large\narea is not easy to produce. But the field between two flat parallel pole pieces\nof a magnet is nearly uniform if the area of the pole faces is large compared\nto their separation, as shown in Fig. 20-7. At the edges, the field "fringes" out\nsomewhat: the magnetic field lines are no longer quite parallel and uniform. The\nparallel evenly spaced field lines in the central region of the gap indicate that\nthe field is uniform at points not too near the edges, much like the electric field\nbetween two parallel plates (Fig. 17-1).\n*Earth\'s north magnetic pole has been moving over time, on the order of 10 km per year in recent\ndecades. Magnetism in rocks solidified at various times in the past (age determined by radioactive\ndating-see Section 30-11) suggests that Earth\'s magnetic poles have not only moved significantly\nover geologic time, but have also reversed direction 400 times over the last 330 million years.\nAlso note that a compass gives a false reading if you are standing on rock containing magnetized\niron ore (as you move around, the compass needle is inconsistent).\nS\n562 CHAPTER 20 Magnetism\n', 'chapter_title': '20-4 Force on an Electric Charge Moving in a Magnetic Field'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': "N\nN\nM\n3\nS\nI\nI\nN\n3\nM\nŠ\nM\n3\nPAN\n'S\nN\n3\nM\nJAPAN\nS\nN\nJAPAN\nI\nB\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFIGURE 20-8 (a) Deflection of compass needles near a current-carrying wire, showing the presence and\ndirection of the magnetic field.

A stationary electric charge and a magnet were shown to\nhave no influence on each other. But in 1820, Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851)\nfound that when a compass is placed near a wire, the compass needle deflects if\n(and only if) the wire carries an electric current. As we have seen, a compass\nneedle is deflected by a magnetic field. So Oersted's experiment showed that\nan electric current produces a magnetic field. He had found a connection between\nelectricity and magnetism.\nA compass needle placed near a straight section of current-carrying wire expe-\nriences a force, causing the needle to align tangent to a circle around the wire,\nFig. 20-8a. Thus, the magnetic field lines produced by a current in a straight wire\nare in the form of circles with the wire at their center, Figs. 20-8b and c. The direction\nof these lines is indicated by the north pole of the compasses in Fig. 20-8a.\nThere is a simple way to remember the direction of the magnetic field lines in this\ncase. It is called a right-hand rule: grasp the wire with your right hand so that your\nthumb points in the direction of the conventional (positive) current; then your\nfingers will encircle the wire in the direction of the magnetic field, Fig. 20-8d.\nThe magnetic field lines due to a circular loop of current-carrying wire can be\ndetermined in a similar way by placing a compass at various locations near the\nloop. The result is shown in Fig. 20-9. Again the right-hand rule can be used, as\nshown in Fig. 20-10. Unlike the uniform field shown in Fig. 20-7, the magnetic\nfields shown in Figs. 20-8 and 20-9 are not uniform-the fields are different in\nmagnitude and direction at different locations.\n-\nEXERCISE B A straight wire carries a current directly toward you.

By Newton's third law, we might expect the reverse to be true\nas well: we should expect that a magnet exerts a force on a current-carrying wire.\nExperiments indeed confirm this effect, and it too was first observed by Oersted.\nSuppose a straight wire is placed in the magnetic field between the poles of a\nhorseshoe magnet as shown in Fig. 20-11, where the vector symbol B represents\nthe magnitude and direction of the magnetic field. When a current flows in the wire,\nexperiment shows that a force is exerted on the wire. But this force is not toward\none or the other pole of the magnet. Instead, the force is directed at right angles\nto the magnetic field direction, downward in Fig. 20-11a. If the current is reversed\nin direction, the force is in the opposite direction, upward as shown in Fig. 20-11b.\nExperiments show that the direction of the force is always perpendicular to the\ndirection of the current and also perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field, B.\nThe direction of the force is given by another right-hand rule, as illustrated in\nFig. 20-11c. Orient your right hand until your outstretched fingers can point in\nthe direction of the conventional current I, and when you bend your fingers they\npoint in the direction of the magnetic field lines, B. Then your outstretched thumb\nwill point in the direction of the force F on the wire.\nThis right-hand rule describes the direction of the force. What about the mag-\nnitude of the force on the wire? It is found experimentally that the magnitude of\nthe force is directly proportional to the current I in the wire, to the magnetic\nfield B (assumed uniform), and to the length & of wire exposed to the magnetic\nfield. The force also depends on the angle 0 between the current direction and the\nmagnetic field (Fig. 20-12), being proportional to sin 0. Thus, the force on a wire\ncarrying a current I with length ( in a uniform magnetic field B is given by\nF œ IlB sin 0.\nWhen the current is perpendicular to the field lines (0 = 90° and sin 90° = 1), the\nforce is strongest. When the wire is parallel to the magnetic field lines (0 = 0°),\nthere is no force at all.\nUp to now we have not defined the magnetic field strength precisely. In fact,\nthe magnetic field B can be conveniently defined in terms of the above propor-\ntion so that the proportionality constant is precisely 1. Thus we have\nF = IlB sin 0.\n(20-1)\nIf the current's direction is perpendicular to the field B (0 = 90°), then the force is\nFmax = IlB.\n[current 1 ฿] (20-2)\n(If B is not uniform, then B in Eqs. 20-1 and 20-2 can be the average field over\nthe length ( of the wire.)\nThe magnitude of B can be defined using Eq. 20-2 as B = Fmax/Il, where\nFmax is the magnitude of the force on a straight length & of wire carrying a\ncurrent I when the wire is perpendicular to B.\n564 CHAPTER 20\n", 'chapter_title': '20-4 Force on an Electric Charge Moving in a Magnetic Field'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXERCISE C A wire carrying current I is perpendicular to a magnetic field of\nstrength B. Assuming a fixed length of wire, which of the following changes will result in\ndecreasing the force on the wire by a factor of 2? (a) Decrease the angle from 90° to 45°;\n(b) decrease the angle from 90° to 30°; (c) decrease the current in the wire to I/2;\n(d) decrease the magnetic field to B/2; (e) none of these will do it.\nThe SI unit for magnetic field B is the tesla (T). From Eq. 20-1 or 20-2, we see\nthat 1T = 1N/A . m. An older name for the tesla is the "weber per meter squared"\n(1 Wb/m2 = 1 T). Another unit sometimes used to specify magnetic field is a cgs\nunit, the gauss (G): 1 G = 10-4 T. A field given in gauss should always be changed\nto teslas before using with other SI units. To get a "feel" for these units, we note\nthat the magnetic field of the Earth at its surface is about 2 G or 0.5 × 10-4T.\nOn the other hand, strong electromagnets can produce fields on the order of 2 T\nand superconducting magnets can produce over 10 T.\nEXAMPLE 20-1\nMagnetic force on a current-carrying wire. A wire carrying\na steady (dc) 30-A current has a length ( = 12 cm between the pole faces of a\nmagnet. The wire is at an angle 0 = 60° to the field (Fig. 20-13).

What magnitude force is exerted on 100 m of this power line?\nOn a diagram, when we want to represent an electric current or a magnetic\nfield that is pointing out of the page (toward us) or into the page, we use O or X,\nrespectively. The O is meant to resemble the tip of an arrow pointing directly\ntoward the reader, whereas the X or ® resembles the tail of an arrow pointing\naway. See Fig. 20-14.\nEXAMPLE 20-2\nMeasuring a magnetic field. A rectangular loop of wire\nhangs vertically as shown in Fig. 20-14. A magnetic field B is directed horizontally,\nperpendicular to the plane of the loop, and points out of the page as represented\nby the symbol O. The magnetic field B is very nearly uniform along the horizontal\nportion of wire ab (length ( = 10.0 cm) which is near the center of the gap of a\nlarge magnet producing the field. The top portion of the wire loop is out of the\nfield. The loop hangs from a balance (reads 0 when B = 0) which measures a\ndownward magnetic force of F = 3.48 × 10-2 N when the wire carries a current\nI = 0.245 A. What is the magnitude of the magnetic field B?\nAPPROACH Three straight sections of the wire loop are in the magnetic field:\na horizontal section and two vertical sections. We apply Eq. 20-1 to each sec-\ntion and use the right-hand rule.\nSOLUTION Using right-hand-rule-2 (page 564), we see that the magnetic force\non the left vertical section of wire points to the left, and the force on the vertical\nsection on the right points to the right. These two forces are equal and in\nopposite directions and so add up to zero. Hence, the net magnetic force on the\nloop is that on the horizontal section ab, whose length is ( = 0.100 m. The\nangle 0 between B and the wire is 0 = 90°, so sin 0 = 1.

Since a current in a wire consists of moving electric charges, we might\nexpect that freely moving charged particles (not in a wire) would also experience a\nforce when passing through a magnetic field. Free electric charges are not as easy to\nproduce in the lab as a current in a wire, but it can be done, and experiments do\nshow that moving electric charges experience a force in a magnetic field.\nFrom what we already know, we can predict the force on a single electric charge\nmoving in a magnetic field B. If N such particles of charge q pass by a given point\nin time t, they constitute a current I = Nq/t. We let t be the time for a charge q\nto travel a distance ( in a magnetic field B; then ( = vt where v is the magnitude\nof the velocity v of the particle. Thus, the force on these N particles is, by Eq. 20-1,\nF = IlB sin 0 = (Nq/t)(vt)B sin 0 = NqvB sin 0. The force on one of the N parti-\ncles is then\nF = quB sin 0.\n[0 between v and B] (20-3)\nThis equation gives the magnitude of the force exerted by a magnetic field on a\nparticle of charge q moving with velocity v at a point where the magnetic field\nhas magnitude B. The angle between v and B is 0. The force is greatest when the\nparticle moves perpendicular to B (0 = 90°):\nFmax = quB.\n[ 1 ]] (20-4)\nThe force is zero if the particle moves parallel to the field lines (0 = 0°). The\ndirection of the force is perpendicular to the magnetic field B and to the velocity v\nof the particle. For a positive charge, the force direction is given by another\nright-hand rule: you orient your right hand so that your outstretched fingers\npoint along the direction of the particle\'s velocity (v), and when you bend your\nfingers they must point along the direction of B. Then your thumb will point in\nthe direction of the force. This is true only for positively charged particles, and\nwill be "up" for the positive particle shown in Fig. 20-15. For negatively charged\nparticles, the force is in exactly the opposite direction, "down" in Fig. 20-15.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 20-3\nNegative charge near a magnet. A nega-\ntive charge -Q is placed at rest near a magnet. Will the charge begin to move? Will\nit feel a force? What if the charge were positive, +Q?\nRESPONSE No to all questions. A charge at rest has velocity equal to zero.\nMagnetic fields exert a force only on moving electric charges (Eq. 20-3).\nEXERCISE E Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 560, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nEXAMPLE 20-4\nMagnetic force on a proton. A magnetic field exerts a\nforce of 8.0 × 10-14 N toward the west on a proton moving vertically upward at a\nspeed of 5.0 × 106 m/s (Fig. 20-16a). When moving horizontally in a northerly\ndirection, the force on the proton is zero (Fig. 20-16b). Determine the magnitude\nand direction of the magnetic field in this region.

In Fig. 20-17 the magnetic field is\ndirected into the paper, as represented by X's. An electron at point P is moving to\nthe right, and the force on it at this point is toward the bottom of the page as\nshown (use the right-hand rule and reverse the direction for negative charge).\nThe electron is thus deflected toward the page bottom. A moment later, say,\nwhen it reaches point Q, the force is still perpendicular to the velocity and is in\nthe direction shown. Because the force is always perpendicular to v, the mag-\nnitude of v does not change-the electron moves at constant speed. We saw in\nChapter 5 that if the force on a particle is always perpendicular to its velocity v,\nthe particle moves in a circle and has a centripetal acceleration of magnitude\na = v2/r (Eq. 5-1). Thus a charged particle moves in a circular path with a\nconstant magnitude of centripetal acceleration in a uniform magnetic field (see\nFig. 20-18). The electron moves clockwise in Fig. 20-17. A positive particle in\nthis field would feel a force in the opposite direction and would thus move\ncounterclockwise.\nEXAMPLE 20-6\nElectron's path in a uniform magnetic field.

Can\na magnetic field be used to stop a charged particle?\nRESPONSE No, because the force is always perpendicular to the velocity of\nthe particle and thus can only change the direction but not the magnitude of its\nvelocity. Also the magnetic force cannot do work on the particle (force and dis-\nplacement are perpendicular, Eq. 6-1) and so cannot change the kinetic energy\nof the particle, Eq. 6-4.\nOBLEM\nMagnetic Fields\nMagnetic fields are somewhat analogous to the electric\nfields of Chapter 16, but there are several important\ndifferences to recall:\nR\n1. The force experienced by a charged particle moving\nin a magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction\nof the magnetic field (and to the direction of the\nvelocity of the particle), whereas the force exerted\nby an electric field is parallel to the direction of the\nfield (and independent of the velocity of the particle).\n2. The right-hand rule, in its different forms, is intended\nto help you determine the directions of magnetic\nfield, and the forces they exert, and/or the directions\nof electric current or charged particle velocity. The\nright-hand rules (Table 20-1) are designed to deal\nwith the "perpendicular" nature of these quantities.\n3. The equations in this Chapter are generally not\nprinted as vector equations, but involve magnitudes\nonly. Right-hand rules are to be used to find direc-\ntions of vector quantities.\nTABLE 20-1 Summary of Right-hand Rules (= RHR)\nPhysical Situation\nExample\nHow to Orient Right Hand\nResult\n1.

The velocity component parallel to the field lines\nexperiences no force (0 = 0), so this component remains constant. The velocity\ncomponent perpendicular to the field results in circular motion about the field\nlines. Putting these two motions together produces a helical (spiral) motion\naround the field lines as shown in Fig. 20-19.\nEXERCISE G What is the sign of the charge in Fig. 20-19? How would you modify the\ndrawing if the charge had the opposite sign?\n*\nAurora Borealis\nCharged ions approach the Earth from the Sun (the "solar wind") and enter the\natmosphere mainly near the poles, sometimes causing a phenomenon called the\naurora borealis or "northern lights" in northern latitudes. To see why, consider\nExample 20-8 and Fig. 20-20 (see also Fig. 20-19). In Fig. 20-20 we imagine\na stream of charged particles approaching the Earth. The velocity component\nperpendicular to the field for each particle becomes a circular orbit around the\nfield lines, whereas the velocity component parallel to the field carries the particle\nalong the field lines toward the poles. As a particle approaches the Earth\'s North\nPole, the magnetic field is stronger and the radius of the helical path becomes\nsmaller (see Example 20-6, r x 1/B).\nA high concentration of high-speed charged particles ionizes the air, and as\nthe electrons recombine with atoms, light is emitted (Chapter 27) which is the\naurora. Auroras are especially spectacular during periods of high sunspot activity\nwhen more charged particles are emitted and more come toward Earth.\n* The Hall Effect\nWhen a current-carrying conductor is held fixed in a magnetic field, the field\nexerts a sideways force on the charges moving in the conductor. For example, if\nelectrons move to the right in the rectangular conductor shown in Fig. 20-21a,\nthe inward magnetic field will exert a downward force on the electrons of mag-\nnitude F = evaB, where va is the drift velocity of the electrons (Section 18-8).\nThus the electrons will tend to move nearer to side D than side C, causing a\npotential difference between sides C and D of the conductor. This potential\ndifference builds up until the electric field EH that it produces exerts a force\n(= eEH) on the moving charges that is equal and opposite to the magnetic force\n(= evaB). This is the Hall effect, named after E. H. Hall who discovered it in 1879.\nThe difference of potential produced is called the Hall emf. Its magnitude is\nVHall= EHd= (F/e)d = vaBd, where d is the width of the conductor.\nA current of negative charges moving to the right is equivalent to positive\ncharges moving to the left, at least for most purposes. But the Hall effect can\ndistinguish these two. As can be seen in Fig. 20-21b, positive particles moving to\nthe left are deflected downward, so that the bottom surface is positive relative to\nthe top surface. This is the reverse of part (a). Indeed, the direction of the emf in the\nHall effect first revealed that it is negative particles that move in metal conductors,\nand that positive "holes" move in p-type semiconductors.\nBecause the Hall emf is proportional to B, the Hall effect can be used to\nmeasure magnetic fields. A device to do so is called a Hall probe. When B is\nknown, the Hall emf can be used to determine the drift velocity of charge\ncarriers.\nB\nv\nFIGURE 20-19 Example 20-8.\nFIGURE 20-20 (a) Diagram showing\na charged particle that approaches\nthe Earth and is "captured" by the\nmagnetic field of the Earth.

You might expect that the field strength at a given point would\nbe greater if the current flowing in the wire were greater; and that the field\nwould be less at points farther from the wire. This is indeed the case. Careful\nexperiments show that the magnetic field B due to the current in a long\nstraight wire is directly proportional to the current I in the wire and inversely\nproportional to the distance r from the wire:\nB x4.\nThis relation is valid as long as r, the perpendicular distance to the wire, is much\nless than the distance to the ends of the wire (i.e., the wire is long).\nThe proportionality constant is written as po/2TT, so\nB = MOI.\n[near a long straight wire] (20-6)\nThe value of the constant po, which is called the permeability of free space, is+\nMo = 4TT X 10-7 T.m/A.\nEXAMPLE 20-9\nCalculation of B near a wire.

The field lines due to I2 form circles around the wire of I2\nand point clockwise, Fig. 20-24. At the midpoint, both fields point upward in\nFig. 20-24 as shown, and so add together.

The net field at the center is the superposition of the four fields (which\nare of equal magnitude), which will point to the left in (a) and is zero in (b).\n20-6 Force between Two Parallel Wires\nWe have seen that a wire carrying a current produces a magnetic field (magnitude\ngiven by Eq. 20-6 for a long straight wire). Also, a current-carrying wire feels\na force when placed in a magnetic field (Section 20-3, Eq. 20-1). Thus, we expect\nthat two current-carrying wires will exert a force on each other.\nConsider two long parallel wires separated by a distance d, as in Fig. 20-26a.\nThey carry currents I1 and I2, respectively. Each current produces a magnetic field\nthat is "felt" by the other, so each must exert a force on the other. For example,\nthe magnetic field B1 produced by I1 in Fig 20-26 is given by Eq. 20-6, which at\nthe location of wire 2 points into the page and has magnitude\nB1 = MOI\n2TT d\nSee Fig. 20-26b, where the field due only to I1 is shown. According to Eq. 20-2, the\nforce F2 exerted by B1 on a length &2 of wire 2, carrying current I2, has magnitude\nF2 = 12 B122.\nNote that the force on I2 is due only to the field produced by I1 . Of course, I2 also\nproduces a field, but it does not exert a force on itself. We substitute B1 into the\nformula for F2 and find that the force on a length 22 of wire 2 is\nF2 = MO 11/2 R2.\na\n[parallel wires] (20-7)\n1\n8\n3\n2\n1\n4\n3\n(a)\n2\n1\n2\nQ\n3\n4\n4\n1\n2\n·\n8\n3\n4\n(b)\nFIGURE 20-25 Example 20-11.\n+\nI2\nI1\nI2\n+-d-+\nWire 1 Wire 2\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 20-26 (a) Two parallel\nconductors carrying currents I1 and I2 .\n(b) Magnetic field B1 produced by I1 .\n(Field produced by I2 is not shown.)\nB1 points into page at position of I2 .\nFIGURE 20-27 (a) Parallel currents in\nthe same direction exert an attractive\nforce on each other.

Then using right-hand-rule-2 of Fig. 20-11c, we see that the force\nexerted on I2 will be to the left in Fig. 20-26b. That is, I1 exerts an attractive force\non I2 (Fig. 20-27a). This is true as long as the currents are in the same direction.\nIf I2 is in the opposite direction from I1, right-hand-rule-2 indicates that the force\nis in the opposite direction. That is, I1 exerts a repulsive force on I2 (Fig. 20-27b).\nI\n112\nReasoning similar to that above shows that the magnetic field produced by I2\nexerts an equal but opposite force on I1. We expect this to be true also from\nNewton\'s third law.

This could not be done if the ampere\nwere defined independently. The ampere, the unit of current, is now defined in\nterms of the magnetic field it produces using the defined value of po -\nIn particular, we use the force between two parallel current-carrying wires,\nEq. 20-7, to define the ampere precisely. If I1 = 12 = 1 A exactly, and the two\nwires are exactly 1 m apart, then\nF\n=\n=\n(4TT X 10-7T.m/A)(1A)(1A)\n= 2 × 10-7N/m.\nl\n2TT d\n(2TT)\n(1 m)\nThus, one ampere is defined as that current flowing in each of two long parallel wires,\n1 m apart, which results in a force of exactly 2 × 10-7 N per meter of length of each wire.\nThis is the precise definition of the ampere, and because it is readily repro-\nducible, is called an operational definition. The coulomb is defined in terms of\nthe ampere as being exactly one ampere-second: 1 C = 1 A . s.\n20-7 Solenoids and Electromagnets\nI\nI\nA long coil of wire consisting of many loops (or turns) of wire is called a solenoid.\nThe current in each loop produces a magnetic field, as we saw in Fig. 20-9. The\nmagnetic field within a solenoid can be fairly large because it is the sum of the fields\ndue to the current in each loop (Fig. 20-28). A solenoid acts like a magnet; one end\ncan be considered the north pole and the other the south pole, depending on the direc-\ntion of the current in the loops (use the right-hand rule). Since the magnetic field\nlines leave the north pole of a magnet, the north pole of the solenoid in Fig. 20-28 is\non the right. As we will see in the next Section, the magnetic field inside a tightly\nwrapped solenoid with N turns of wire in a length l, each carrying current I, is\nS\nN\nl\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 20-28 (a) Magnetic field\nof a solenoid.

(b) Photo of iron filings\naligning along B field lines of a\nsolenoid with loosely spaced loops.\nThe field is smoother if the loops are\nclosely spaced.\nB = MONI .\n(20-8)\nIf a piece of iron is placed inside a solenoid, the magnetic field is increased\ngreatly because the iron becomes a magnet. The resulting magnetic field is the sum\nof the field due to the current and the field due to the iron, and can be hundreds or\nthousands of times the field due to the current alone (see Section 20-12). Such an\niron-core solenoid is an electromagnet.\nElectromagnets have many practical applications, from use in motors and\ngenerators to producing large magnetic fields for research. Sometimes an iron\ncore is not present-the magnetic field then comes only from the current in the\nwire coils. A large field B in this case requires a large current I, which produces a\nlarge amount of waste heat (P = 12R). But if the current-carrying wires are made\nof superconducting material kept below the transition temperature (Section 18-9),\nvery high fields can be produced, and no electric power is needed to maintain\nthe large current in the superconducting coils. Energy is required, however, to\nrefrigerate the coils at the low temperatures where they superconduct.\n572 CHAPTER 20\n', 'chapter_title': '20-4 Force on an Electric Charge Moving in a Magnetic Field'}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Another useful device consists of a solenoid into which a rod of iron is\npartially inserted. This combination is also referred to as a solenoid. One simple\nuse is as a doorbell (Fig. 20-29). When the circuit is closed by pushing the button,\nthe coil effectively becomes a magnet and exerts a force on the iron rod. The rod\nis pulled into the coil and strikes the bell. A large solenoid is used for the starter\nof a car: when you engage the starter, you are closing a circuit that not only turns\nthe starter motor, but first activates a solenoid that moves the starter into direct\ncontact with the gears on the engine\'s flywheel. Solenoids are used a lot as switches\nin cars and many other devices.

The iron rod of\nFig. 20-29, instead of striking a bell, strikes one side of a pair of electric contact\npoints, opening them and opening the circuit. They react very quickly (~ 1 ms)\nand to very small currents (~ 5 mA) and thus protect humans (not just property)\nand save lives.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nDoorbell, car starter\nIron rod\nBell\nO\nSpring\nSwitch\n· Voltage\nI\nVoltage\nFIGURE 20-29 Solenoid used as a\ndoorbell.\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nMagnetic circuit breakers\n20-8 Ampère\'s Law\nThe relation between the current in a long straight wire and the magnetic field it\nproduces is given by Eq. 20-6, Section 20-5. This equation is valid only for a long\nstraight wire. Is there a general relation between a current in a wire of any\nshape and the magnetic field around it? Yes: the French scientist André Marie\nAmpère (1775-1836) proposed such a relation shortly after Oersted\'s discovery.\nConsider any (arbitrary) closed path around a current, as shown in Fig. 20-30, and\nimagine this path as being made up of short segments each of length Al. We\ntake the product of the length of each segment times the component of magnetic\nfield B parallel to that segment. If we now sum all these terms, the result (accord-\ning to Ampère) will be equal to po times the net current Iencl that passes through\nthe surface enclosed by the path. This is known as Ampère\'s law and can be written\nΣΒΊ Δ. = μο Iencl ·\n(20-9)\nAMPÈRE\'S LAW\nThe symbol 2 means "the sum of" and By means the component of B parallel to\nthat particular Al. The lengths Al are chosen small enough so that By is essen-\ntially constant along each length. The sum must be made over a closed path, and\nIencl is the total net current enclosed by this closed path.\nI1\nI2\nClosed path\nmade up of\nsegments of\nlength Al\n1\nI1\nI2\nArea enclosed\nby the path\nFIGURE 20-30 Arbitrary path\nenclosing electric currents, for\nAmpère\'s law.

Let us find the magnitude of B at point P, a distance r\nfrom the wire in Fig. 20-31. The magnetic field lines are circles with the wire at\ntheir center (as in Fig. 20-8). As the path to be used in Eq. 20-9, we choose a\nconvenient one: a circle of radius r, because at any point on this path, B will be\ntangent to this circle. For any short segment of the circle (Fig. 20-31), B will be\nparallel to that segment, so By = B. Suppose we break the circular path down\ninto 100 segments.+ Then Ampère's law states that\n(B Al)1 + (B Al)2 + (B Al)3 + ··· + (B Al)100 = MOI.\nThe dots represent all the terms we did not write down. All the segments are the\nsame distance from the wire, so by symmetry we expect B to be the same at each\nsegment. We can then factor out B from the sum:\nB(Al1 + Al2 + Al3 + ... + Al100) = MOI.\nThe sum of the segment lengths Al equals the circumference of the circle, 2Trr. Thus\nwe have\nor\nB = MOI\n.\n2Tr\nThis is just Eq. 20-6 for the magnetic field near a long straight wire, so Ampère's\nlaw agrees with experiment in this case.\nA great many experiments indicate that Ampère's law is valid in general.\nPractically, it can be used to calculate the magnetic field mainly for simple or\nsymmetric situations. Its importance is that it relates the magnetic field to the\ncurrent in a direct and mathematically elegant way. Ampère's law is considered\none of the basic laws of electricity and magnetism. It is valid for any situation\nwhere the currents and fields are not changing in time.\nField Inside a Solenoid\nWe now use Ampère's law to calculate the magnetic field inside a solenoid\n(Section 20-7), a long coil of wire with many loops or turns, Fig. 20-32. Each\nloop produces a magnetic field as was shown in Fig. 20-9, and the total field\ninside the solenoid will be the sum of the fields due to each current loop as shown\nin Fig. 20-32a for a few loops. If the solenoid has many loops and they are close\ntogether, the field inside will be nearly uniform and parallel to the solenoid axis\nexcept at the ends, as shown in Fig. 20-32b. Outside the solenoid, the field lines\nspread out in space, so the magnetic field is much weaker than inside. For apply-\ning Ampère's law, we choose the path abcd shown in Fig. 20-33 far from either\nend. We consider this path as made up of four straight segments, the sides of the\nrectangle: ab, bc, cd, da. Then Ampère's law, Eq. 20-9, becomes\nB\nB\n(a)\n(B| Al) ab + (B| Al)bc + (B| Al)cd + (B| Al) da = Molencl .\nThe first term in the sum on the left will be (nearly) zero because the\nfield outside the solenoid is negligible compared to the field inside. Furthermore,\nB is perpendicular to the segments bc and da, so these terms are zero, too.\n*Actually, Ampère's law is precisely accurate when there is an infinite number of infinitesimally short\nsegments, but that leads into calculus.\n(b)\nFIGURE 20-33 Cross-sectional view into a\nsolenoid.

This is the magnetic field magnitude inside\na solenoid. B depends only on the number of loops per unit length, N /l, and the\ncurrent I. The field does not depend on the position within the solenoid, so B is\nuniform inside the solenoid. This is strictly true only for an infinite solenoid, but\nit is a good approximation for real ones at points not close to the ends.\nThe direction of the magnetic field inside the solenoid is found by applying\nright-hand-rule-1, Fig. 20-8d (see also Figs. 20-9 and 20-10), and is as shown in\nFig. 20-33.\n20-9 Torque on a Current Loop;\nMagnetic Moment\nAxis of rotation\nWhen an electric current flows in a closed loop of wire placed in an external\nmagnetic field, as shown in Fig. 20-34, the magnetic force on the current can\nproduce a torque. This is the principle behind a number of important practical\ndevices, including motors and analog voltmeters and ammeters, which we discuss\nin the next Section.\nCurrent flows through the rectangular loop in Fig. 20-34a, whose face we\nassume is parallel to B. B exerts no force and no torque on the horizontal\nsegments of wire because they are parallel to the field and sin 0 = 0 in Eq. 20-1.\nBut the magnetic field does exert a force on each of the vertical sections of wire\nas shown, F1 and F2 (see also top view, Fig. 20-34b). By right-hand-rule-2\n(Fig. 20-11c or Table 20-1) the direction of the force on the upward current on\nthe left is in the opposite direction from the equal magnitude force F2 on the\ndownward current on the right. These forces give rise to a net torque that acts to\nrotate the coil about its vertical axis.\nLet us calculate the magnitude of this torque. From Eq. 20-2 (current 1 B),\nthe force F = IaB, where a is the length of the vertical arm of the coil (Fig. 20-34a).\nThe lever arm for each force is b/2, where b is the width of the coil and the "axis"\nis at the midpoint. The torques around this axis produced by F1 and F2 act in the\nsame direction (Fig. 20-34b), so the total torque T is the sum of the two torques:\nT = laB 2 + IaB - = IabB = IAB,\nwhere A = ab is the area of the coil. If the coil consists of N loops of wire, the\ncurrent is then NI, so the torque becomes\nT = NIAB.\nIf the coil makes an angle with the magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 20-34c, the\nforces are unchanged, but each lever arm is reduced from 2b to 2b sin 0. Note\nthat the angle 0 is taken to be the angle between B and the perpendicular to the\nface of the coil, Fig. 20-34c. So the torque becomes\nT = NIAB sin 0.\n(20-10)\nThis formula, derived here for a rectangular coil, is valid for any shape of flat coil.\nThe quantity NIA is called the magnetic dipole moment of the coil:\nM = NIA\n(20-11)\nand is considered a vector perpendicular to the coil.\n1\nb\nB\nF\nB\n1\na\nO\nF2\nI\nI\nI\nI\n(a)\nF1\nAxis\nB\nI\n0-01\nF2\n(b)\nM = NIA\n( to coil face)\nB\nF\n1\nI\nθ\nAxis\nB\nI\n®I\nB\nF\n(c)\n2\nFIGURE 20-34 Calculating the\ntorque on a current loop in a\nmagnetic field B.

Among\nthe most common are motors and loudspeakers. First we look at the galvanometer,\nwhich is the easiest to explain, and which you find on the instrument panels of\nautomobiles and other devices whose readout is via a pointer or needle.\nGalvanometer\nThe basic component of analog meters (those with pointer and dial), including\nanalog ammeters, voltmeters, and ohmmeters, including gauges on car dash-\nboards, is a galvanometer. We have already seen how these meters are designed\n(Section 19-8), and now we can examine how the crucial element, a galvanometer,\nworks. As shown in Fig. 20-35, a galvanometer consists of a coil of wire (with\nattached pointer) suspended in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. When\ncurrent flows through the loop of wire, the magnetic field B exerts a torque T on\nthe loop, as given by Eq. 20-10,\nT = NIAB sin 0.\nB\nThis torque is opposed by a spring which exerts a torque Ts approximately\nproportional to the angle ø through which it is turned (Hooke's law). That is,\nI / Pivot\nI\nTs = kø,\nFIGURE 20-35 Galvanometer.\nFIGURE 20-36 Galvanometer coil\n(3 loops shown) wrapped on an iron\ncore.\nPointer\nB\nB\nN\nS\nB\nIron core\nwhere k is the stiffness constant of the spring. The coil and attached pointer\nrotate to the angle where the torques balance. When the needle is in equilibrium\nat rest, the torques have equal magnitude: kø = NIAB sin 0, so\n0\n=\nNIAB sin 0\n.\nk\nThe deflection of the pointer, ø, is directly proportional to the current I flowing\nin the coil, but also depends on the angle 0 the coil makes with B. For a useful\nmeter we need ø to depend only on the current I, independent of 0. To solve this\nproblem, magnets with curved pole pieces are used and the galvanometer coil is\nwrapped around a cylindrical iron core as shown in Fig. 20-36. The iron tends to\nconcentrate the magnetic field lines so that B always points parallel to the face of\nthe coil at the wire outside the core. The force is then always perpendicular to the\nface of the coil, and the torque will not vary with angle. Thus ø will be propor-\ntional to I, as required for a useful meter.\n576 CHAPTER 20 Magnetism\n", 'chapter_title': '20-4 Force on an Electric Charge Moving in a Magnetic Field'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Electric Motors\nAn electric motor changes electric energy into (rotational) mechanical energy.\nA motor works on the same principle as a galvanometer (a torque is exerted on a\ncurrent-carrying loop in a magnetic field) except that the coil must turn continu-\nously in one direction. The coil is mounted on an iron cylinder called the rotor or\narmature, Fig. 20-37. Actually, there are several coils, although only one is indicated\nin Fig. 20-37. The armature is mounted on a shaft or axle. When the armature\nis in the position shown in Fig. 20-37, the magnetic field exerts forces on the\ncurrent in the loop as shown (perpendicular to B and to the current direction).\nHowever, when the coil, which is rotating clockwise in Fig. 20-37, passes beyond\nthe vertical position, the forces would then act to return the coil back toward the\nvertical if the current remained the same. But if the current could be reversed at\nthat critical moment, the forces would reverse, and the coil would continue rotating\nin the same direction. Thus, alternation of the current is necessary if a motor is to\nturn continuously in one direction. This can be achieved in a de motor with the use\nof commutators and brushes: as shown in Fig. 20-38, input current passes through\nstationary brushes that rub against the conducting commutators mounted on the\nmotor shaft. At every half revolution, each commutator changes its connection\nover to the other brush. Thus the current in the coil reverses every half revolution\nas required for continuous rotation.\nLead wires to armature coil\nCommutator\nFIGURE 20-38 Commutator-brush\narrangement in a dc motor ensures\nalternation of the current in the\narmature to keep rotation continuous\nin one direction. The commutators are\nattached to the motor shaft and turn\nwith it, whereas the brushes remain\nstationary.\nBrushes\nBattery (dc)\nMost motors contain several coils, called windings, each connected to a different\nportion of the armature, Fig. 20-39. Current flows through each coil only during a\nsmall part of a revolution, at the time when its orientation results in the maximum\ntorque. In this way, a motor produces a much steadier torque than can be obtained\nfrom a single coil.\nAn ac motor, with ac current as input, can work without commutators since the\ncurrent itself alternates. Many motors use wire coils to produce the magnetic field\n(electromagnets) instead of a permanent magnet. Indeed the design of most motors\nis more complex than described here, but the general principles remain the same.\nLoudspeakers and Headsets\nLoudspeakers and audio headsets also work on the principle that a magnet exerts\na force on a current-carrying wire. The electrical output of a stereo or TV set is\nconnected to the wire leads of the speaker or earbuds. The speaker leads are\nconnected internally to a coil of wire, which is itself attached to the speaker cone,\nFig. 20-40. The speaker cone is usually made of stiffened cardboard and is\nmounted so that it can move back and forth freely (except at its attachment on\nthe outer edges). A permanent magnet is mounted directly in line with the coil of\nwire. When the alternating current of an audio signal flows through the wire coil,\nwhich is free to move within the magnet, the coil experiences a force due to the\nmagnetic field of the magnet. (The force is to the right at the instant shown in\nFig. 20-40, RHR-2, page 568.) As the current alternates at the frequency of the\naudio signal, the coil and attached speaker cone move back and forth at the same\nfrequency, causing alternate compressions and rarefactions of the adjacent air,\nand sound waves are produced. A speaker thus changes electrical energy into\nsound energy, and the frequencies and intensities of the emitted sound waves can\nbe an accurate reproduction of the electrical input.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nDC motor\nArmature\nB\nI\nN\nS\nB\nF\nBrushes\n–\n+\nVoltage source\nFIGURE 20-37 Diagram of a simple\ndc motor.

The magnetic\nfields B and B' point out of the\npaper (indicated by the dots).\nA mass spectrometer is a device to measure masses of atoms. It is used today not\nonly in physics but also in chemistry, geology, and medicine, often to identify atoms\n(and their concentration) in given samples. Ions are produced by heating the sam-\nple, or by using an electric current. As shown in Fig. 20-41, the ions (mass m,\ncharge q) pass through slit S1 and enter a region (before S2) where there are\ncrossed (1) electric and magnetic fields. Ions follow a straight-line path in this\nregion if the electric force qE (upward on a positive ion) is just balanced by the\nmagnetic force quB (downward on a positive ion): that is, if qE = quB, or\nv = E.\nB\nOnly those ions whose speed is v = E/B will pass through undeflected and\nemerge through slit S2. (This arrangement is called a velocity selector.) In the\nsemicircular region, after S2, there is only a magnetic field, B', so the ions follow\na circular path. The radius of the circular path is found from their mark on film,\nor by detectors, if B' is fixed. If instead r is fixed by the position of a detector,\nthen B' is varied until detection occurs. Newton's second law, ¿F = ma, applied to\nan ion moving in a circle under the influence only of the magnetic field B' gives\nquB' = mv2/r. Since v = E/B, we have\nm = 4B'r = 42\nE\nqBB'r\n.\n(20-12)\nAll the quantities on the right side are known or can be measured, and thus m can\nbe determined.\nHistorically, the masses of many atoms were measured this way. When a pure\nsubstance was used, it was sometimes found that two or more closely spaced\nmarks would appear on the film. For example, neon produced two marks whose\nradii corresponded to atoms of 20 and 22 atomic mass units (u). Impurities were\nruled out and it was concluded that there must be two types of neon with differ-\nent masses. These different forms were called isotopes. It was soon found that most\nelements are mixtures of isotopes, and the difference in mass is due to different\nnumbers of neutrons (discussed in Chapter 30).\nEXAMPLE 20-14\nMass spectrometry. Carbon atoms of atomic mass 12.0 u\nare found to be mixed with an unknown element. In a mass spectrometer with\nfixed B', the carbon traverses a path of radius 22.4 cm and the unknown's path has\na 26.2-cm radius. What is the unknown element? Assume the ions of both elements\nhave the same charge.\nAPPROACH The carbon and unknown atoms pass through the same electric\nand magnetic fields. Hence their masses are proportional to the radius of their\nrespective paths (see Eq. 20-12).\nSOLUTION We write a ratio for the masses, using Eq. 20-12:\nmx\n=\nqBB'rx/E\nrx\nmc\nqBB'rc/E\nrc\n=\n26.2 cm\n= 1.17.\n22.4 cm\nThus mx = 1.17 × 12.0 u = 14.0 u. The other element is probably nitrogen\n(see the Periodic Table, inside the back cover).\nNOTE The unknown could also be an isotope such as carbon-14 (14C). See\nAppendix B. Further physical or chemical analysis would be needed.\n578 CHAPTER 20 Magnetism\n", 'chapter_title': '20-4 Force on an Electric Charge Moving in a Magnetic Field'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': '*\n20-12\nFerromagnetism:\nDomains and Hysteresis\nWe saw in Section 20-1 that iron (and a few other materials) can be made into\nstrong magnets. These materials are said to be ferromagnetic.\n* Sources of Ferromagnetism\nMicroscopic examination reveals that a piece of iron is made up of tiny regions\nknown as domains, less than 1 mm in length or width. Each domain behaves like\na tiny magnet with a north and a south pole. In an unmagnetized piece of iron,\nthe domains are arranged randomly, Fig. 20-42a. The magnetic effects of the\ndomains cancel each other out, so this piece of iron is not a magnet. In a magnet,\nthe domains are preferentially aligned in one direction as shown in Fig. 20-42b\n(downward in this case). A magnet can be made from an unmagnetized piece of\niron by placing it in a strong magnetic field. (You can make a needle magnetic,\nfor example, by stroking it with one pole of a strong magnet.) The magnetization\ndirection of domains may actually rotate slightly to be more nearly parallel to the\nexternal field, and the borders of domains may move so domains with magnetic\norientation parallel to the external field grow larger (compare Figs. 20-42a and b).\nWe can now explain how a magnet can pick up unmagnetized pieces of iron\nlike paper clips. The magnet\'s field causes a slight realignment of the domains in\nthe unmagnetized object so that it becomes a temporary magnet with its north pole\nfacing the south pole of the permanent magnet; thus, attraction results. Similarly,\nelongated iron filings in a magnetic field acquire aligned domains and align them-\nselves to reveal the shape of the magnetic field, Fig. 20-43.\nAn iron magnet can remain magnetized for a long time, and is referred to as\na "permanent magnet." But if you drop a magnet on the floor or strike it with a\nhammer, you can jar the domains into randomness and the magnet loses some or\nall of its magnetism. Heating a permanent magnet can also cause loss of magnetism,\nfor raising the temperature increases the random thermal motion of atoms, which\ntends to randomize the domains. Above a certain temperature known as the\nCurie temperature (1043 K for iron), a magnet cannot be made at all.\nThe striking similarity between the fields produced by a bar magnet and by\na loop of electric current (Figs. 20-4b, 20-9) offers a clue that perhaps magnetic\nfields produced by electric currents may have something to do with ferromagnetism.\nAccording to modern atomic theory, atoms can be roughly visualized as having\nelectrons that orbit around a central nucleus. The electrons are charged, and so\nconstitute an electric current and therefore produce a magnetic field. But the\nfields due to orbiting electrons end up adding to zero. Electrons themselves pro-\nduce an additional magnetic field, almost as if they and their electric charge were\nspinning about their own axes. And it is this magnetic field due to electron spin+\nthat is believed to produce ferromagnetism in most ferromagnetic materials.\nIt is believed today that all magnetic fields are caused by electric currents.\nThis means that magnetic field lines always form closed loops, unlike electric\nfield lines which begin on positive charges and end on negative charges.\n*\nMagnetic Permeability\nIf a piece of ferromagnetic material like iron is placed inside a solenoid to\nform an electromagnet (Section 20-7), the magnetic field increases greatly over\nthat produced by the current in the solenoid coils alone, often by hundreds\nor thousands of times. This happens because the domains in the iron become\naligned by the external field produced by the current in the solenoid coil.\n*The name "spin" comes from an early suggestion that this intrinsic magnetic field arises from the\nelectron "spinning" on its axis (as well as "orbiting" the nucleus) to produce the extra field. However,\nthis view of a spinning electron is oversimplified and not valid (see Chapter 28).\n4\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 20-42 (a) An unmagnetized\npiece of iron is made up of domains\nthat are randomly arranged.

Often BM >> Bo. The total field can also be written by replacing the\nconstant po in Eq. 20-8 (B = po NI/l for a solenoid) by another constant called\nthe magnetic permeability u, which is characteristic of the magnetic material inside\nthe coil. Then B = uNI/l. For ferromagnetic materials, u is much greater\nthan po. For all other materials, its value is very close to po.+ The value of u,\nhowever, is not constant for ferromagnetic materials; it depends on the strength\nof the "external" field Bo, as the following experiment shows.\n*\nHysteresis\nMeasurements on magnetic materials often use a torus or toroid, which is like a\nlong solenoid bent into the shape of a donut (Fig. 20-44), so practically all the\nlines of B remain within the toroid. Consider a toroid with an iron core that is\ninitially unmagnetized and there is no current in the wire loops. Then the current I\nis slowly increased, and B0 (which is due only to I) increases linearly with I. The\ntotal field B also increases, but follows the curved line shown in Fig. 20-45\nwhich is a graph of total B vs. B0 . Initially, point a, the domains are randomly\noriented. As B0 increases, the domains become more and more aligned until at\npoint b, nearly all are aligned. The iron is said to be approaching saturation.\nFIGURE 20-45 Total magnetic field B in an\niron-core toroid as a function of the external\nfield B0 ( B0 is caused by the current I in the coil).\nWe use gauss (1 G = 10-4T) so that labels\nare clear.\nB (G)\n12,000 -\nb\n10,000\n8000 -\n6000\n4000 -\n2000 -\na\nB0 (G)\n-\n0\n4\n8\n12\nFIGURE 20-46 Hysteresis curve.\n12,000 - B (G)\n10,000 -\nc\n8000 -\n6000 -\n4000 -\n2000\nd\na\n0\n4\nb\ng\n8\n12\nB0 (G)\nf\ne\nNext, suppose current in the coil is reduced, so the field B0 decreases. If the current\n(and Bo) is reduced to zero, point c in Fig. 20-46, the domains do not become\ncompletely random. Instead, some permanent magnetism remains in the iron\ncore. If the current is increased in the opposite direction, enough domains can be\nturned around so the total B becomes zero at point d. As the reverse current is\nincreased further, the iron approaches saturation in the opposite direction, point e.\nFinally, if the current is again reduced to zero (point f) and then increased in\nthe original direction, the total field follows the path efgb, again approaching\nsaturation at point b.\nNotice that the field did not pass through the origin (point a) in this cycle.\nThe fact that the curve does not retrace itself on the same path is called hysteresis.\nThe curve bcdefgb is called a hysteresis loop. In such a cycle, much energy is\ntransformed to thermal energy (friction) due to realigning of the domains. Note\nthat at points c and f, the iron core is magnetized even though there is no current\nin the coils. These points correspond to a permanent magnet.\n*All materials are slightly magnetic. Nonferromagnetic materials fall into two principal classes:\n(1) paramagnetic materials consist of atoms that have a net magnetic dipole moment which can align\nslightly with an external field, just as the galvanometer coil in Fig. 20-35 experiences a torque that\ntends to align it; (2) diamagnetic materials have atoms with no net dipole moment, but in the pres-\nence of an external field electrons revolving in one direction increase in speed slightly whereas\nelectrons revolving in the opposite direction are reduced in speed; the result is a slight net magnetic\neffect that opposes the external field.\n580 CHAPTER 20\n', 'chapter_title': '20-4 Force on an Electric Charge Moving in a Magnetic Field'}, {'page_number': 22, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Summary\nA magnet has two poles, north and south. The north pole is that\nend which points toward geographic north when the magnet is\nfreely suspended. Like poles of two magnets repel each other,\nwhereas unlike poles attract.\nWe can picture that a magnetic field surrounds every mag-\nnet. The SI unit for magnetic field is the tesla (T).\nElectric currents produce magnetic fields. For example,\nthe lines of magnetic field due to a current in a straight wire\nform circles around the wire, and the field exerts a force on\nmagnets (or currents) near it.\nA magnetic field exerts a force on an electric current. For\na straight wire of length & carrying a current I, the force has\nmagnitude\nF = IlB sin 0,\n(20-1)\nwhere 0 is the angle between the magnetic field B and the cur-\nrent direction. The direction of the force is perpendicular to the\ncurrent-carrying wire and to the magnetic field, and is given\nby a right-hand rule. Equation 20-1 serves as the definition of\nmagnetic field B.\nSimilarly, a magnetic field exerts a force on a charge q\nmoving with velocity v of magnitude\nF = quB sin 0,\n(20-3)\nwhere 0 is the angle between v and B. The direction of F is\nperpendicular to v and to B (again a right-hand rule). The\npath of a charged particle moving perpendicular to a uniform\nmagnetic field is a circle.\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field produced by a cur-\nrent I in a long straight wire, at a distance r from the wire, is\nB = MOI\n(20-6)\nQuestions\n1. A compass needle is not always balanced parallel to the\nEarth\'s surface, but one end may dip downward. Explain.\n2. Explain why the Earth\'s "north pole" is really a magnetic\nsouth pole. Indicate how north and south magnetic poles\nwere defined and how we can tell experimentally that the\nnorth pole is really a south magnetic pole.\n3. In what direction are the magnetic field lines surrounding\na straight wire carrying a current that is moving directly\naway from you? Explain.\n4. A horseshoe magnet is held vertically with the north pole on\nthe left and south pole on the right. A wire passing between\nthe poles, equidistant from them, carries a current directly\naway from you. In what direction is the force on the wire?\nExplain.\n5. Will a magnet attract any metallic object, such as those made\nof aluminum or copper? (Try it and see.) Why is this so?\n6. Two iron bars attract each other no matter which ends are\nplaced close together. Are both magnets? Explain.\n7. The magnetic field due to current in wires in your home\ncan affect a compass. Discuss the effect in terms of currents,\nincluding if they are ac or dc.\n8. If a negatively charged particle enters a region of uniform\nmagnetic field which is perpendicular to the particle\'s\nvelocity, will the kinetic energy of the particle increase,\ndecrease, or stay the same? Explain your answer. (Neglect\ngravity and assume there is no electric field.)\nTwo currents exert a force on each other via the magnetic\nfield each produces. Parallel currents in the same direction\nattract each other; currents in opposite directions repel.\nThe magnetic field inside a long tightly wound solenoid is\nB = PONI/l,\n(20-8)\nwhere N is the number of loops in a length & of coil, and I is the\ncurrent in each loop.\nAmpère\'s law states that around any chosen closed loop\npath, the sum of each path segment Al times the component\nof B parallel to the segment equals uo times the current I\nenclosed by the closed path:\nΣΒ ΔΩ = μο Iencl ·\n(20-9)\nThe torque T on N loops of current I in a magnetic field B\nis\nT = NIAB sin 0.\n(20-10)\nThe force or torque exerted on a current-carrying wire by a\nmagnetic field is the basis for operation of many devices, such\nas motors, loudspeakers, and galvanometers used in analog\nelectric meters.\n[* A mass spectrometer uses electric and magnetic fields to\ndetermine the mass of ions.]\n[*Iron and a few other materials that are ferromagnetic\ncan be made into strong permanent magnets. Ferromagnetic\nmaterials are made up of tiny domains-each a tiny magnet-\nwhich are preferentially aligned in a permanent magnet. When\niron or another ferromagnetic material is placed in a magnetic\nfield B0 due to a current, the iron becomes magnetized. When\nthe current is turned off, the material remains magnetized;\nwhen the current is increased in the opposite direction, a graph\nof the total field B versus B0 is a hysteresis loop, and the fact\nthat the curve does not retrace itself is called hysteresis.]\n9.
