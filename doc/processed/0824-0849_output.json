Rather, we mention them to show why,\nin the early 1920s, it became increasingly evident that a new, more comprehensive\ntheory was needed. It was not long in coming. Less than two years after de Broglie\ngave us his matter-wave hypothesis, Erwin Schrödinger (1887-1961; Fig. 28-1)\nand Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976; Fig. 28-2) independently developed a new\ncomprehensive theory.\n28-1 Quantum Mechanics-A New Theory\nThe new theory, called quantum mechanics, has been extremely successful. It\nunifies the wave-particle duality into a single consistent theory and has success-\nfully dealt with the spectra emitted by complex atoms, even the fine details. It\nexplains the relative brightness of spectral lines and how atoms form molecules.\nIt is also a much more general theory that covers all quantum phenomena from\nblackbody radiation to atoms and molecules. It has explained a wide range of\nnatural phenomena and from its predictions many new practical devices have\nbecome possible. Indeed, it has been so successful that it is accepted today by\nnearly all physicists as the fundamental theory underlying physical processes.\nQuantum mechanics deals mainly with the microscopic world of atoms and\nlight. But this new theory, when it is applied to macroscopic phenomena, must be\nable to produce the old classical laws. This, the correspondence principle (already\nmentioned in Section 27-12), is satisfied fully by quantum mechanics.\nThis doesn't mean we should throw away classical theories such as Newton's\nlaws. In the everyday world, classical laws are far easier to apply and they give\nsufficiently accurate descriptions. But when we deal with high speeds, close to\nthe speed of light, we must use the theory of relativity; and when we deal with the\ntiny world of the atom, we use quantum mechanics.\nAlthough we won't go into the detailed mathematics of quantum mechanics,\nwe will discuss the main ideas and how they involve the wave and particle\nproperties of matter to explain atomic structure and other applications.\n28-2 The Wave Function and Its\nInterpretation; the Double-Slit Experiment\nThe important properties of any wave are its wavelength, frequency, and ampli-\ntude. For an electromagnetic wave, the frequency (or wavelength) determines\nwhether the light is in the visible spectrum or not, and if so, what color it is. We\nalso have seen that the frequency is a measure of the energy of the corresponding\nphoton, E = hf (Eq. 27-4). The amplitude or displacement of an electromagnetic\nwave at any point is the strength of the electric (or magnetic) field at that point,\nand is related to the intensity of the wave (the brightness of the light).\n804 CHAPTER 28 Quantum Mechanics of Atoms\n", 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 803, and answer it again now.

The ampli-\ntude of an electromagnetic wave is represented by the electric and magnetic fields,\nE and B. In quantum mechanics, this role is played by the wave function, which\nis given the symbol Y (the Greek capital letter psi, pronounced "sigh"). Thus\nrepresents the wave displacement, as a function of time and position, of a new\nkind of field which we might call a "matter" field or a matter wave.\nTo understand how to interpret the wave function W, we make an analogy\nwith light using the wave-particle duality.\nWe saw in Chapter 11 that the intensity I of any wave is proportional to the\nsquare of the amplitude. This holds true for light waves as well, as we saw in\nChapter 22. That is,\nI x E2,\nwhere E is the electric field strength. From the particle point of view, the intensity\nof a light beam (of given frequency) is proportional to the number of photons, N,\nthat pass through a given area per unit time. The more photons there are, the\ngreater the intensity. Thus\nI x E2 x N.\nThis proportion can be turned around so that we have\nN & E2.\nThat is, the number of photons (striking a page of this book, say) is proportional\nto the square of the electric field strength.\nIf the light beam is very weak, only a few photons will be involved. Indeed, it\nis possible to "build up" a photograph in a camera using very weak light so the\neffect of photons arriving can be seen. If we are dealing with only one photon,\nthe relationship above (N & E2) can be interpreted in a slightly different way. At\nany point, the square of the electric field strength E2 is a measure of the probability\nthat a photon will be at that location. At points where E2 is large, there is a high\nprobability the photon will be there; where E2 is small, the probability is low.\nWe can interpret matter waves in the same way, as was first suggested by\nMax Born (1882-1970) in 1927. The wave function Y may vary in magnitude\nfrom point to point in space and time. If V describes a collection of many electrons,\nthen 2 at any point will be proportional to the number of electrons expected to\nbe found at that point. When dealing with small numbers of electrons we can\'t\nmake very exact predictions, so 2 takes on the character of a probability. If Y,\nwhich depends on time and position, represents a single electron (say, in an atom),\nthen 2 is interpreted like this: 42 at a certain point in space and time represents\nthe probability of finding the electron at the given position and time. Thus 2 is\noften referred to as the probability density or probability distribution.\nDouble-Slit Interference Experiment for Electrons\nTo understand this better, we take as a thought experiment the familiar double-slit\nexperiment, and consider it both for light and for electrons.\nConsider two slits whose size and separation are on the order of the wave-\nlength of whatever we direct at them, either light or electrons, Fig. 28-3. We\nknow very well what would happen in this case for light, since this is just Young\'s\ndouble-slit experiment (Section 24-3): an interference pattern would be seen\non the screen behind. If light were replaced by electrons with wavelength\ncomparable to the slit size, they too would produce an interference pattern\n(recall Fig. 27-12). In the case of light, the pattern would be visible to the eye or\ncould be recorded on film, semiconductor sensor, or screen. For electrons, a fluores-\ncent screen could be used (it glows where an electron strikes).\nFIGURE 28-3 Parallel beam, of\nlight or electrons, falls on two slits\nwhose sizes are comparable to the\nwavelength.

At first,\nthe flashes would seem random. Indeed, there is no way to predict just where any\none electron would hit the screen. If we let the experiment run for a long time,\nand kept track of where each electron hit the screen, we would soon see a pattern\nemerging-the interference pattern predicted by the wave theory; see Fig. 28-4.\nThus, although we could not predict where a given electron would strike the\nscreen, we could predict probabilities. (The same can be said for photons.) The\nprobability, as we saw, is proportional to 2. Where 2 is zero, we would get a\nminimum in the interference pattern. And where 2 is a maximum, we would get\na peak in the interference pattern.\nThe interference pattern would thus occur even when electrons (or photons)\npassed through the slits one at a time. So the interference pattern could not arise\nfrom the interaction of one electron with another. It is as if an electron passed\nthrough both slits at the same time, interfering with itself. This is possible because\nan electron is not precisely a particle. It is as much a wave as it is a particle, and\na wave could travel through both slits at once. But what would happen if we\ncovered one of the slits so we knew that the electron passed through the other slit,\nand a little later we covered the second slit so the electron had to have passed\nthrough the first slit? The result would be that no interference pattern would be\nseen. We would see, instead, two bright areas (or diffraction patterns) on the\nscreen behind the slits.\nIf both slits are open, the screen shows an interference pattern as if each\nelectron passed through both slits, like a wave. Yet each electron would make a\ntiny spot on the screen as if it were a particle.\nThe main point of this discussion is this: if we treat electrons (and other\nparticles) as if they were waves, then Y represents the wave amplitude. If we\ntreat them as particles, then we must treat them on a probabilistic basis. The\nsquare of the wave function, 2, gives the probability of finding a given electron\nat a given point. We cannot predict-or even follow-the path of a single\nelectron precisely through space and time.\n28-3 The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\nWhenever a measurement is made, some uncertainty is always involved. For\nexample, you cannot make an absolutely exact measurement of the length of a\ntable. Even with a measuring stick that has markings 1 mm apart, there will be an\ninaccuracy of perhaps 2mm or so. More precise instruments will produce more\nprecise measurements. But there is always some uncertainty involved in a\nmeasurement, no matter how good the measuring device. We expect that by\nusing more precise instruments, the uncertainty in a measurement can be made\nindefinitely small.\nBut according to quantum mechanics, there is actually a limit to the precision\nof certain measurements. This limit is not a restriction on how well instruments\ncan be made; rather, it is inherent in nature. It is the result of two factors: the\nwave-particle duality, and the unavoidable interaction between the thing observed\nand the observing instrument. Let us look at this in more detail.\nTo make a measurement on an object without disturbing it, at least a little, is\nnot possible. Consider trying to locate a lost Ping-pong ball in a dark room: you\ncould probe about with your hand or a stick, or you could shine a light and detect\nthe photons reflecting off the ball. When you search with your hand or a stick,\nyou find the ball\'s position when you touch it, but at the same time you unavoid-\nably bump it, and give it some momentum. Thus you won\'t know its future\nposition. If you search for the Ping-pong ball using light, in order to "see" the ball\nat least one photon (really, quite a few) must scatter from it, and the reflected\nphoton must enter your eye or some other detector. When a photon strikes an\nordinary-sized object, it only slightly alters the motion or position of the object.\n806 CHAPTER 28 Quantum Mechanics of Atoms\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 803, and answer it again now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': "But a photon striking a tiny object like an electron transfers enough momentum\nto greatly change the electron's motion and position in an unpredictable way. The\nmere act of measuring the position of an object at one time makes our knowledge\nof its future position imprecise.\nNow let us see where the wave-particle duality comes in. Imagine a thought\nexperiment in which we are trying to measure the position of an object, say an\nelectron, with photons, Fig. 28-5. (The arguments would be similar if we were\nusing, instead, an electron microscope.) As we saw in Chapter 25, objects can be\nseen to a precision at best of about the wavelength of the radiation used due to\ndiffraction. If we want a precise position measurement, we must use a short\nwavelength. But a short wavelength corresponds to high frequency and large\nmomentum (p = h/A); and the more momentum the photons have, the more\nmomentum they can give the object when they strike it. If we use photons of\nlonger wavelength, and correspondingly smaller momentum, the object's motion\nwhen struck by the photons will not be affected as much. But the longer wave-\nlength means lower resolution, so the object's position will be less accurately\nknown. Thus the act of observing produces an uncertainty in both the position\nand the momentum of the electron. This is the essence of the uncertainty principle\nfirst enunciated by Heisenberg in 1927.\nQuantitatively, we can make an approximate calculation of the magnitude of\nthe uncertainties. If we use light of wavelength à, the position can be measured at\nbest to a precision of about À. That is, the uncertainty in the position measurement,\nAx, is approximately\nAx ~ 1.\nSuppose that the object can be detected by a single photon. The photon has a\nmomentum px = h/> (Eq. 27-6). When the photon strikes our object, it will\ngive some or all of this momentum to the object, Fig. 28-5. Therefore, the final\nx momentum of our object will be uncertain in the amount\nAPA ~ A\nsince we can't tell how much momentum will be transferred. The product of\nthese uncertainties is\n(Ax) (APx) = (x) () = h.\nThe uncertainties could be larger than this, depending on the apparatus and the\nnumber of photons needed for detection. A more careful mathematical calcula-\ntion shows the product of the uncertainties as, at best, about\n(4x)(4px) ≥\n.\nh\n(28-1)\nThis is a mathematical statement of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, or, as it\nis sometimes called, the indeterminancy principle. It tells us that we cannot measure\nboth the position and momentum of an object precisely at the same time. The\nmore accurately we try to measure the position, so that Ax is small, the greater\nwill be the uncertainty in momentum, Apx . If we try to measure the momentum\nvery accurately, then the uncertainty in the position becomes large. The uncertainty\nprinciple does not forbid individual precise measurements, however. For example,\nin principle we could measure the position of an object exactly. But then its\nmomentum would be completely unknown. Thus, although we might know the\nposition of the object exactly at one instant, we could have no idea at all where it\nwould be a moment later. The uncertainties expressed here are inherent in nature,\nand reflect the best precision theoretically attainable even with the best instruments.\nElectron\nLight\nLight\nsource\nsource\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 28-5 Thought experiment\nfor observing an electron with a\npowerful light microscope.

Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nAnother useful form of the uncertainty principle relates energy and time,\nand we examine this as follows. The object to be detected has an uncertainty in\nposition Ax ~ À. The photon that detects it travels with speed c, and it takes a\ntime At ~ Ax/c ~ A/c to pass through the distance of uncertainty. Hence, the\nmeasured time when our object is at a given position is uncertain by about\nAt ~ 1.\nSince the photon can transfer some or all of its energy (= hf = hc/A) to our\nobject, the uncertainty in energy of our object as a result is\nAE ~ he\nhc\nThe product of these two uncertainties is\n(DE)(At) ~ ()(2) ~ h.\nA more careful calculation gives\nUNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE\n(energy and time)\n(AE)(At) ≥\nh\n.\n(28-2)\nThis form of the uncertainty principle tells us that the energy of an object can be\nuncertain (or can be interpreted as briefly nonconserved) by an amount AE for a\ntime At ~ h/ (21 AE).\nThe quantity (h/2Tr) appears so often in quantum mechanics that for conven-\nience it is given the symbol h ("h-bar").

But it isn\'t simply a particle. Indeed, we have the uncertainty principle\nbecause an electron-and matter in general-has wave as well as particle prop-\nerties. What the uncertainty principle really tells us is that if we insist on thinking\nof the electron as a particle, then there are certain limitations on this simplified\nview-namely, that the position and velocity cannot both be known precisely at\nthe same time; and even that the electron does not have a precise position and\nmomentum at the same time (because it is not simply a particle). Similarly, the\nenergy can be uncertain (or nonconserved) by an amount AE for a time At ~ h /AE.\nBecause Planck\'s constant, h, is so small, the uncertainties expressed in the\nuncertainty principle are usually negligible on the macroscopic level. But at the\nlevel of atomic sizes, the uncertainties are significant. Because we consider\nordinary objects to be made up of atoms containing nuclei and electrons, the\nuncertainty principle is relevant to our understanding of all of nature. The\nuncertainty principle expresses, perhaps most clearly, the probabilistic nature of\nquantum mechanics. It thus is often used as a basis for philosophic discussion.\n808 CHAPTER 28 Quantum Mechanics of Atoms\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 803, and answer it again now.

For example, if a stone is thrown a number of times with the same\ninitial velocity and angle, and the forces on it remain the same, the path of the\nprojectile will always be the same. If the forces are known (gravity and air resis-\ntance, if any), the stone\'s path can be precisely predicted. This mechanistic view\nimplies that the future unfolding of the universe, assumed to be made up of\nparticulate objects, is completely determined.\nThis classical deterministic view of the physical world has been radically altered\nby quantum mechanics. As we saw in the analysis of the double-slit experiment\n(Section 28-2), electrons all treated in the same way will not all end up in the same\nplace. According to quantum mechanics, certain probabilities exist that an elec-\ntron will arrive at different points. This is very different from the classical view, in\nwhich the path of a particle is precisely predictable from the initial position and\nvelocity and the forces exerted on it. According to quantum mechanics, the position\nand velocity of an object cannot even be known accurately at the same time.\nThis is expressed in the uncertainty principle, and arises because basic entities,\nsuch as electrons, are not considered simply as particles: they have wave properties\nas well. Quantum mechanics allows us to calculate only the probability" that, say,\nan electron (when thought of as a particle) will be observed at various places.\nQuantum mechanics says there is some inherent unpredictability in nature. This\nis very different from the deterministic view of classical mechanics.\nBecause matter is considered to be made up of atoms, even ordinary-sized\nobjects are expected to be governed by probability, rather than by strict deter-\nminism. For example, quantum mechanics predicts a finite (but negligibly small)\nprobability that when you throw a stone, its path might suddenly curve upward\ninstead of following the downward-curved parabola of normal projectile motion.\nQuantum mechanics predicts with extremely high probability that ordinary objects\nwill behave just as the classical laws of physics predict. But these predictions are\nconsidered probabilities, not absolute certainties. The reason that macroscopic\nobjects behave in accordance with classical laws with such high probability is due\nto the large number of molecules involved: when large numbers of objects are\npresent in a statistical situation, deviations from the average (or most probable)\napproach zero. It is the average configuration of vast numbers of molecules that\nfollows the so-called fixed laws of classical physics with such high probability,\nand gives rise to an apparent "determinism." Deviations from classical laws are\nobserved when small numbers of molecules are dealt with. We can say, then, that\nalthough there are no precise deterministic laws in quantum mechanics, there are\nstatistical laws based on probability.\nIt is important to note that there is a difference between the probability\nimposed by quantum mechanics and that used in the nineteenth century to\nunderstand thermodynamics and the behavior of gases in terms of molecules\n(Chapters 13 and 15). In thermodynamics, probability is used because there are\nfar too many particles to keep track of. But the molecules are still assumed to\nmove and interact in a deterministic way following Newton\'s laws. Probability in\nquantum mechanics is quite different; it is seen as inherent in nature, and not as a\nlimitation on our abilities to calculate or to measure.\n*Note that these probabilities can be calculated precisely, just like predictions of probabilities at\nrolling dice or dealing cards; but they are unlike predictions of probabilities at sporting events, which\nare only estimates.\n810 CHAPTER 28 Quantum Mechanics of Atoms\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 803, and answer it again now.

This suggests that a description of\nmatter in space and time may not be completely correct. This deep and far-reaching\nconclusion has been a lively topic of discussion among philosophers. Perhaps the\nmost important and influential philosopher of quantum mechanics was Bohr. He\nargued that a space-time description of actual atoms and electrons is not possible.\nYet a description of experiments on atoms or electrons must be given in terms of\nspace and time and other concepts familiar to ordinary experience, such as waves\nand particles. We must not let our descriptions of experiments lead us into believ-\ning that atoms or electrons themselves actually move in space and time as classical\nparticles.\n28-5 Quantum-Mechanical View\nof Atoms\nAt the beginning of this Chapter, we discussed the limitations of the Bohr model\nof atomic structure. Now we examine the quantum-mechanical theory of atoms,\nwhich is a far more complete theory than the old Bohr model. Although the Bohr\nmodel has been discarded as an accurate description of nature, nonetheless, quan-\ntum mechanics reaffirms certain aspects of the older theory, such as that electrons\nin an atom exist only in discrete states of definite energy, and that a photon of\nlight is emitted (or absorbed) when an electron makes a transition from one state to\nanother. But quantum mechanics is a much deeper theory, and has provided us\nwith a very different view of the atom. According to quantum mechanics, electrons\ndo not exist in well-defined circular orbits as in the Bohr model. Rather, the\nelectron (because of its wave nature) can be thought of as spread out in space as\na "cloud." The size and shape of the electron cloud can be calculated for a given\nstate of an atom. For the ground state in the hydrogen atom, the electron cloud\nis spherically symmetric, as shown in Fig. 28-6. The electron cloud at its higher\ndensities roughly indicates the "size" of an atom. But just as a cloud may not\nhave a distinct border, atoms do not have a precise boundary or a well-defined\nsize. Not all electron clouds have a spherical shape, as we shall see later in this\nChapter.\nThe electron cloud can be interpreted from either the particle or the wave\nviewpoint. Remember that by a particle we mean something that is localized in\nspace-it has a definite position at any given instant. By contrast, a wave is\nspread out in space. The electron cloud, spread out in space as in Fig. 28-6, is a\nresult of the wave nature of electrons. Electron clouds can also be interpreted as\nprobability distributions (or probability density) for a particle. As we saw in\nSection 28-3, we cannot predict the path an electron will follow (thinking of it as\na particle). After one measurement of its position we cannot predict exactly where\nit will be at a later time. We can only calculate the probability that it will be found\nat different points. If you were to make 500 different measurements of the position\nof an electron in a hydrogen atom, the majority of the results would show the\nelectron at points where the probability is high (dark area in Fig. 28-6). Only\noccasionally would the electron be found where the probability is low. The\nelectron cloud or probability distribution becomes small (or thin) at places,\nespecially far away, but never becomes zero. So quantum mechanics suggests\nthat an atom is not mostly empty space, and that there is no truly empty space in\nthe universe.\nNucleus.\nFIGURE 28-6 Electron cloud or\n"probability distribution" for the\nground state of the hydrogen atom,\nas seen from afar.

Much of what we say here also applies to more complex atoms,\nwhich are discussed in the next Section.\nQuantum mechanics is a much more sophisticated and successful theory than\nBohr\'s. Yet in a few details they agree. Quantum mechanics predicts the same\nbasic energy levels (Fig. 27-29) for the hydrogen atom as does the Bohr model.\nThat is,\nEn =\n13.6 e V\n,\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\nnº\nL-\n2K-\n-\nmẹ = 2\n1₺ +\nmę = 1\n0\nmę= 0\n-1 +\nmę = - 1\n-2₺+\nmẹ =- 2\nFIGURE 28-7 Quantization of\nangular momentum direction for\nl = 2. (Magnitude of Ĺ is\nL = v6 h.)\nFIGURE 28-8 Energy levels (not\nto scale). When a magnetic field is\napplied, the n = 3, l = 2 energy\nlevel is split into five separate levels,\ncorresponding to the five values of\nmę (2, 1, 0, -1, -2). An n = 2,\n( = 1 level is split into three levels\n(mę = 1, 0, -1). Transitions can occur\nbetween levels (not all transitions are\nshown), with photons of several\nslightly different frequencies being\ngiven off (the Zeeman effect).\nmę= 2\nn = 3,\nl=2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\nn = 2,\nmg=1\n0\n-1\nwhere n is an integer. In the simple Bohr model, there was only one quantum\nnumber, n. In quantum mechanics, four different quantum numbers are needed\nto specify each state in the atom:\n(1) The quantum number, n, from the Bohr model is found also in quantum\nmechanics and is called the principal quantum number. It can have any\ninteger value from 1 to oo. The total energy of a state in the hydrogen atom\ndepends on n, as we saw above.\n(2) The orbital quantum number, l, is related to the magnitude of the angular\nmomentum of the electron; l can take on integer values from 0 to (n - 1).\nFor the ground state, n = 1, { can only be zero.+ For n = 3, & can be 0, 1, or 2.\nThe actual magnitude of the angular momentum L is related to the quantum\nnumber l by\nL = Ve(l + 1) ₺\n(28-3)\n(where again h = h/2T). The value of l has almost no effect on the total energy\nin the hydrogen atom; only n does to any appreciable extent (but see fine\nstructure below). In atoms with two or more electrons, the energy does depend\non l as well as n, as we shall see.\n(3) The magnetic quantum number, me, is related to the direction of the electron\'s\nangular momentum, and it can take on integer values ranging from -l to +l.\nFor example, if ( = 2, then me can be -2, -1, 0, +1, or +2. Since angular\nmomentum is a vector, it is not surprising that both its magnitude and its direc-\ntion would be quantized. For l = 2, the five different directions allowed can\nbe represented by the diagram of Fig. 28-7. This limitation on the direction\nof L is often called space quantization. In quantum mechanics, the direction\nof the angular momentum is usually specified by giving its component\nalong the z axis (this choice is arbitrary). Then L2 is related to me by the\nequation\nLz = męh.\nThe values of Lx and Ly are not definite, however. The name for me derives not\nfrom theory (which relates it to Lz), but from experiment. It was found that\nwhen a gas-discharge tube was placed in a magnetic field, the spectral lines\nwere split into several very closely spaced lines. This splitting, known as the\nZeeman effect, implies that the energy levels must be split (Fig. 28-8), and thus\nthat the energy of a state depends not only on n but also on me when a mag-\nnetic field is applied-hence the name "magnetic quantum number."\n*This replaces Bohr theory, which assigned & = 1 to the ground state (Eq. 27-11).\n812 CHAPTER 28 Quantum Mechanics of Atoms\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 803, and answer it again now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': '(4) Finally, there is the spin quantum number, ms, which for an electron can have\nonly two values, ms = +2 and ms = - 2. The existence of this quantum\nnumber did not come out of Schrödinger\'s original wave theory, as did n, l,\nand mẹ. Instead, a subsequent modification by P. A. M. Dirac (1902-1984)\nexplained its presence as a relativistic effect. The first hint that ms was needed,\nhowever, came from experiment. A careful study of the spectral lines of hydrogen\nshowed that each actually consisted of two (or more) very closely spaced lines\neven in the absence of an external magnetic field. It was at first hypothesized\nthat this tiny splitting of energy levels, called fine structure, was due to angular\nmomentum associated with a spinning of the electron. That is, the electron might\nspin on its axis as well as orbit the nucleus, just as the Earth spins on its axis\nas it orbits the Sun. The interaction between the tiny current of the spinning\nelectron could then interact with the magnetic field due to the orbiting charge\nand cause the small observed splitting of energy levels. (The energy thus depends\nslightly on me and ms .)* Today we consider the picture of a spinning electron as\nnot legitimate. We cannot even view an electron as a localized object, much less\na spinning one. What is important is that the electron can have two different\nstates due to some intrinsic property that behaves like an angular momentum, and\nwe still call this property "spin." The two possible values of ms (+ 2 and - 2)\nare often said to be "spin up" and "spin down," referring to the two possible\ndirections of the spin angular momentum.\nThe possible values of the four quantum numbers for an electron in the\nhydrogen atom are summarized in Table 28-1.\nTABLE 28-1 Quantum Numbers for an Electron\nName\nSymbol\nPossible Values\nPrincipal\nn\n1, 2, 3, ... , 00.\nOrbital\nl\nFor a given n: { can be 0, 1, 2, ··· , n - 1.\nMagnetic\nme\nFor given n and &: mẹ can be l, l - 1, ··· , 0, ··· , -l.\nSpin\nms\nFor each set of n, l, and me: ms can be + 2 or - 2.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 28-4\nPossible states for n = 3.

For l = 2, me can\nbe 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, which is five different possibilities. For each of these, ms can\nbe either up or down (+ 2 or - 2); so for ( = 2, there are 2 × 5 = 10 states. For\nl = 1, me can be 1, 0, -1, and since ms can be + 2 or - 2 for each of these, we\nhave 6 more possible states. Finally, for { = 0, me can only be 0, and there are\nonly 2 states corresponding to ms = +2 and - 2.

For n = 1, 2 and me\ncan only be zero and the electron distribution is as shown in Fig. 28-6. For\nn = 2, l can be 0 or 1. The distribution for n = 2, l = 0 is shown in Fig. 28-9a,\nand it is seen to differ from that for the ground state (Fig. 28-6), although it is still\nspherically symmetric. For n = 2, l = 1, the distributions are not spherically\nsymmetric as shown in Figs. 28-9b (for me = 0) and 28-9c (for me = +1 or -1).\nAlthough the spatial distributions of the electron can be calculated for the\nvarious states, it is difficult to measure them experimentally. Most of the experi-\nmental information about atoms has come from a careful examination of the\nemission spectra under various conditions as in Figs. 27-23 and 24-28.\n[Chemists refer to atomic states, and especially the shape in space of their\nprobability distributions, as orbitals. Each atomic orbital is characterized by its\nquantum numbers n, l, and me, and can hold one or two electrons (ms = +2 or\nms = - 2); s-orbitals (§ = 0) are spherically symmetric, Figs. 28-6 and 28-9a;\np-orbitals ({ = 1) can be dumbbell shaped with lobes, Fig. 28-9b, or donut shaped\nif combining me = +1 and me = - 1, Fig. 28-9c.]\nSelection Rules: Allowed and Forbidden Transitions\nAnother prediction of quantum mechanics is that when a photon is emitted or\nabsorbed, transitions can occur only between states with values of & that differ by\nexactly one unit:\nAl = + 1.\nAccording to this selection rule, an electron in an ( = 2 state can jump only to a\nstate with { = 1 or ( = 3. It cannot jump to a state with { = 2 or ( = 0. A tran-\nsition such as ( = 2 to ( = 0 is called a forbidden transition. Actually, such a\ntransition is not absolutely forbidden and can occur, but only with very low\nprobability compared to allowed transitions-those that satisfy the selection rule\nAl = + 1. Since the orbital angular momentum of an H atom must change by\none unit when it emits a photon, conservation of angular momentum tells us that\nthe photon must carry off angular momentum. Indeed, experimental evidence of\nmany sorts shows that the photon can be assigned a spin angular momentum of 1h.\n814 CHAPTER 28 Quantum Mechanics of Atoms\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 803, and answer it again now.

Now we briefly discuss more complex atoms, those that contain more than\none electron. Their energy levels can be determined experimentally from an analysis\nof their emission spectra. The energy levels are not the same as in the H atom,\nbecause the electrons interact with each other as well as with the nucleus. Each\nelectron in a complex atom still occupies a particular state characterized by the\nquantum numbers n, l, me, and ms. For atoms with more than one electron,\nthe energy levels depend on both n and l.\nThe number of electrons in a neutral atom is called its atomic number, Z;\nZ is also the number of positive charges (protons) in the nucleus, and determines\nwhat kind of atom it is. That is, Z determines the fundamental properties that dis-\ntinguish one type of atom from another.\nTo understand the possible arrangements of electrons in an atom, a new\nprinciple was needed. It was introduced by Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958; Fig. 28-2)\nand is called the Pauli exclusion principle. It states:\nTABLE 28-2 Ground-State\nQuantum Numbers\nNo two electrons in an atom can occupy the same quantum state.\nThus, no two electrons in an atom can have exactly the same set of the quantum\nnumbers n, l, mẹ, and ms . The Pauli exclusion principle forms the basis not only\nfor understanding atoms, but also for understanding molecules and bonding, and\nother phenomena as well. (See also note at end of this Section.)\nHelium, Z = 2\nLet us now look at the structure of some of the simpler atoms when they are\nin the ground state. After hydrogen, the next simplest atom is helium with two\nelectrons. Both electrons can have n = 1, because one can have spin up (ms = + 2)\nand the other spin down (ms = - 2), thus satisfying the exclusion principle.\nSince n = 1, then l and me must be zero (Table 28-1, page 813). Thus the two\nelectrons have the quantum numbers indicated at the top of Table 28-2.\nn\nL\nme\nms\n1\n0\n0\n1\n2\n1\n0\n0\n–\n1\n2\nLithium, Z = 3\nLithium has three electrons, two of which can have n = 1. But the third\ncannot have n = 1 without violating the exclusion principle. Hence the third\nelectron must have n = 2. It happens that the n = 2, l = 0 level has a lower\nenergy than n = 2, l = 1. So the electrons in the ground state have the quantum\nnumbers indicated in Table 28-2. The quantum numbers of the third electron\ncould also be, say, (n, l, me, ms) = (3, 1, -1, 2). But the atom in this case would\nbe in an excited state, because it would have greater energy. It would not be long\nbefore it jumped to the ground state with the emission of a photon. At room\ntemperature, unless extra energy is supplied (as in a discharge tube), the vast\nmajority of atoms are in the ground state.\nn\nL\nms\n1\n0\n0\n1\n2\n1\n0\n0\n–\n1\n2\n2\n0\n0\n1\n2\nSodium, Z = 11\nWe can continue in this way to describe the quantum numbers of each elec-\ntron in the ground state of larger and larger atoms.

A basic assumption is that all electrons are identical, indis-\ntinguishable one from another. Similarly, all protons are identical, all neutrons are\nidentical, and so on. The exclusion principle does not apply to particles with integer\nspin (0, 1, 2, and so on), such as the photon and T meson, all of which are referred\nto as bosons (after Satyendranath Bose, who derived a statistical theory for them).]\n28-8 The Periodic Table of Elements\nMore than a century ago, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) arranged the (then)\nknown elements into what we now call the Periodic Table of the elements. The\natoms were arranged according to increasing mass, but also so that elements with\nsimilar chemical properties would fall in the same column. Today\'s version is shown\ninside the back cover of this book. Each square contains the atomic number Z,\nthe symbol for the element, and the atomic mass (in atomic mass units). Finally,\nthe lower left corner shows the configuration of the ground state of the atom. This\nrequires some explanation. Electrons with the same value of n are referred to as\nbeing in the same shell. Electrons with n = 1 are in one shell (the K shell), those\nwith n = 2 are in a second shell (the L shell), those with n = 3 are in the\nthird (M) shell, and so on. Electrons with the same values of n and l are referred\nto as being in the same subshell. Letters are often used to specify the value of l\nas shown in Table 28-3. That is, { = 0 is the s subshell; ( = 1 is the p subshell;\n( = 2 is the d subshell; beginning with { = 3, the letters follow the alphabet,\nf, g, h, i, and so on. (The first letters s, p, d, and f were originally abbreviations\nof "sharp," "principal," "diffuse," and "fundamental," terms referring to the experi-\nmental spectra.)\nThe Pauli exclusion principle limits the number of electrons possible in each\nshell and subshell. For any value of (, there are 20 + 1 possible me values (me can\nbe any integer from 1 to (, from -1 to -l, or zero), and two possible ms values.\nThere can be, therefore, at most 2(20 + 1) electrons in any ( subshell. For\nexample, for l = 2, five me values are possible (2, 1, 0, -1, -2), and for each\nof these, ms can be + 2 or - 2 for a total of 2(5) = 10 states. Table 28-3 lists the\nmaximum number of electrons that can occupy each subshell.\nBecause the energy levels depend almost entirely on the values of n and l, it\nis customary to specify the electron configuration simply by giving the n value and\nthe appropriate letter for l, with the number of electrons in each subshell given as\na superscript. The ground-state configuration of sodium, for example, is written as\n1s22s22p63s1. This is simplified in the Periodic Table by specifying the configuration\nonly of the outermost electrons and any other nonfilled subshells (see Table 28-4\nhere, and the Periodic Table inside the back cover).\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 28-6\nElectron configurations. Which of the\nfollowing electron configurations are possible, and which are not: (a) 1s22s22p63s3;\n(b) 1s22s22p63s23p54s2; (c) 1s22s22p62d1?\nRESPONSE (a) This is not allowed, because too many electrons (three) are\nshown in the s subshell of the M (n = 3) shell. The s subshell has me = 0, with\ntwo slots only, for "spin up" and "spin down" electrons.\n(b) This is allowed, but it is an excited state. One of the electrons from the\n3p subshell has jumped up to the 4s subshell. Since there are 19 electrons, the\nelement is potassium.\n(c) This is not allowed, because there is no d (l = 2) subshell in the n = 2 shell\n(Table 28-1). The outermost electron will have to be (at least) in the n = 3\nshell.\n816 CHAPTER 28 Quantum Mechanics of Atoms\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 803, and answer it again now.

It was designed to also show regularity according to chemical prop-\nerties. Although this is treated in chemistry textbooks, we discuss it here briefly\nbecause it is a result of quantum mechanics. See the Periodic Table inside the\nback cover.\nAll the noble gases (in column VIII of the Periodic Table) have completely\nfilled shells or subshells. That is, their outermost subshell is completely full, and\nthe electron distribution is spherically symmetric. With such full spherical sym-\nmetry, other electrons are not attracted nor are electrons readily lost (ionization\nenergy is high). This is why the noble gases are chemically inert (more on this\nwhen we discuss molecules and bonding in Chapter 29). Column VII contains the\nhalogens, which lack one electron from a filled shell. Because of the shapes of\nthe orbits (see Section 29-1), an additional electron can be accepted from\nanother atom, and hence these elements are quite reactive. They have a valence\nof -1, meaning that when an extra electron is acquired, the resulting ion has a\nnet charge of -le. Column I of the Periodic Table contains the alkali metals, all\nof which have a single outer s electron. This electron spends most of its time\noutside the inner closed shells and subshells which shield it from most of the\nnuclear charge. Indeed, it is relatively far from the nucleus and is attracted to it\nby a net charge of only about +1e, because of the shielding effect of the other\nelectrons. Hence this outer electron is easily removed and can spend much of its\ntime around another atom, forming a molecule. This is why the alkali metals are\nvery chemically reactive and have a valence of +1. The other columns of the\nPeriodic Table can be treated similarly.\nThe presence of the transition elements in the center of the Periodic Table, as\nwell as the lanthanides (rare earths) and actinides below, is a result of incomplete\ninner shells. For the lowest Z elements, the subshells are filled in a simple order:\nfirst 1s, then 2s, followed by 2p, 3s, and 3p. You might expect that 3d (n = 3, l = 2)\nwould be filled next, but it isn\'t. Instead, the 4s level actually has a slightly lower\nenergy than the 3d (due to electrons interacting with each other), so it fills first\n(K and Ca). Only then does the 3d shell start to fill up, beginning with Sc, as can\nbe seen in Table 28-4. (The 4s and 3d levels are close, so some elements have\nonly one 4s electron, such as Cr.) Most of the chemical properties of these transi-\ntion elements are governed by the relatively loosely held 4s electrons, and hence\nthey usually have valences of +1 or +2. A similar effect is responsible for the\nlanthanides and actinides, which are shown at the bottom of the Periodic Table\nfor convenience. All have very similar chemical properties, which are determined\nby their two outer 6s or 7s electrons, whereas the different numbers of electrons\nin the unfilled inner shells have little effect.\nCAUTION\nSubshells are not always\nfilled in "order"\n*28-9 X-Ray Spectra and\nAtomic Number\nThe line spectra of atoms in the visible, UV, and IR regions of the EM spectrum\nare mainly due to transitions between states of the outer electrons. Much of the\npositive charge of the nucleus is shielded from these electrons by the negative\ncharge on the inner electrons. But the innermost electrons in the n = 1 shell "see"\nthe full charge of the nucleus. Since the energy of a level is proportional to Z2\n(see Eq. 27-15), for an atom with Z = 50, we would expect wavelengths about\n502 = 2500 times shorter than those found in the Lyman series of hydrogen\n(around 100 nm), or (100 nm)/(2500) ~ 10-2 to 10-1 nm. Such short wavelengths\nlie in the X-ray region of the spectrum.\n*SECTION 28-9 X-Ray Spectra and Atomic Number 817\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 803, and answer it again now.

If we look at the spectrum of\nwavelengths emitted by an X-ray tube, we see that the spectrum consists of two\nparts: a continuous spectrum with a cutoff at some À, which depends only on the\nvoltage across the tube, and a series of peaks superimposed. A typical example is\nshown in Fig. 28-11. The smooth curve and the cutoff wavelength Ào move to the\nleft as the voltage across the tube increases. The sharp lines or peaks (labeled Ka\nand Kg in Fig. 28-11), however, remain at the same wavelength when the voltage\nis changed, although they are located at different wavelengths when different tar-\nget materials are used. This observation suggests that the peaks are characteristic of\nthe target material used. Indeed, we can explain the peaks by imagining that the\nelectrons accelerated by the high voltage of the tube can reach sufficient energies\nthat, when they collide with the atoms of the target, they can knock out one of\nthe very tightly held inner electrons. Then we explain these characteristic X-rays\n(the peaks in Fig. 28-11) as photons emitted when an electron in an upper state\ndrops down to fill the vacated lower state. The K lines result from transitions into\nthe K shell (n = 1). The Ka line consists of photons emitted in a transition that\noriginates from the n = 2 (L) shell and drops to the n = 1 (K) shell. On the other\nhand, the Kg line reflects a transition from the n = 3 (M) shell down to the K shell.\nAn L line is due to a transition into the L shell, and so on.\nMeasurement of the characteristic X-ray spectra has allowed a determina-\ntion of the inner energy levels of atoms. It has also allowed the determination of\nZ values for many atoms, because (as we have seen) the wavelength of the shortest\ncharacteristic X-rays emitted will be inversely proportional to Z2. Actually,\nfor an electron jumping from, say, the n = 2 to the n = 1 level (Ka line), the\nwavelength is inversely proportional to (Z - 1)2 because the nucleus is shielded\nby the one electron that still remains in the 1s level. In 1914, H. G. J. Moseley\n(1887-1915) found that a plot of v1/A vs. Z produced a straight line, Fig. 28-12,\nwhere À is the wavelength of the Kg line.

When electrons strike the\ntarget, they collide with atoms of the material and give up most of their energy as\nheat (about 99%, so X-ray tubes must be cooled). Electrons can also give up\nenergy by emitting a photon of light: an electron decelerated by interaction with\natoms of the target (Fig. 28-13) emits radiation because of its deceleration\n(Chapter 22), and in this case it is called bremsstrahlung (German for "braking\nradiation").

The continuous\nX-ray spectrum (Fig. 28-11) is explained as being due to such bremsstrahlung\ncollisions in which varying amounts of energy are lost by the electrons. The\nshortest-wavelength X-ray (the highest frequency) must be due to an electron\nthat gives up all its kinetic energy to produce one photon in a single collision.\nSince the initial kinetic energy of an electron is equal to the energy given it by the\naccelerating voltage, V, then KE = eV.

The\nphotons emitted will consequently have lower energy and frequency than the\nabsorbed photon. When the absorbed photon is in the UV and the emitted photons\nare in the visible region of the spectrum, this phenomenon is called fluorescence\n(Fig. 28-15).\nThe wavelength for which fluorescence will occur depends on the energy levels\nof the particular atoms. Because the frequencies are different for different sub-\nstances, and because many substances fluoresce readily, fluorescence is a powerful\ntool for identification of compounds. It is also used for assaying-determining\nhow much of a substance is present-and for following substances along a natural\nmetabolic pathway in biological organisms. For detection of a given compound, the\nstimulating light must be monochromatic, and solvents or other materials present\nmust not fluoresce in the same region of the spectrum. Sometimes the observation\nof fluorescent light being emitted is sufficient to detect a compound. In other\ncases, spectrometers are used to measure the wavelengths and intensities of the\nemitted light.\nFluorescent lightbulbs work in a two-step process. The applied voltage accel-\nerates electrons that strike atoms of the gas in the tube and cause them to be\nexcited. When the excited atoms jump down to their normal levels, they emit UV\nphotons which strike a fluorescent coating on the inside of the tube. The light we\nsee is a result of this material fluorescing in response to the UV light striking it.\nMaterials such as those used for luminous watch dials, and other glow-in-\nthe-dark products, are said to be phosphorescent. When an atom is raised to a\nnormal excited state, it drops back down within about 10-8 s. In phosphorescent\nsubstances, atoms can be excited by photon absorption to energy levels called\nmetastable, which are states that last much longer because to jump down is a\n"forbidden" transition (Section 28-6). Metastable states can last even a few\nseconds or longer. In a collection of such atoms, many of the atoms will descend\nto the lower state fairly soon, but many will remain in the excited state for over\nan hour. Hence light will be emitted even after long periods. When you put a\nluminous watch dial close to a bright lamp, many atoms are excited to metastable\nstates, and you can see the glow for a long time afterward.\n28-11 Lasers\nA laser is a device that can produce a very narrow intense beam of monochromatic\ncoherent light. (By coherent, we mean that across any cross section of the beam, all\nparts have the same phase.+) The emitted beam is a nearly perfect plane wave.\nAn ordinary light source, on the other hand, emits light in all directions (so the\nintensity decreases rapidly with distance), and the emitted light is incoherent (the\ndifferent parts of the beam are not in phase with each other). The excited atoms that\nemit the light in an ordinary lightbulb act independently, so each photon emitted\ncan be considered as a short wave train lasting about 10-8 s. Different wave trains\nbear no phase relation to one another. Just the opposite is true of lasers.\nThe action of a laser is based on quantum theory. We have seen that a photon\ncan be absorbed by an atom if (and only if) the photon energy hf corresponds to\nthe energy difference between an occupied energy level of the atom and an avail-\nable excited state, Fig. 28-16a. If the atom is already in the excited state, it may\njump down spontaneously (i.e., no stimulus) to the lower state with the emission\nof a photon. However, if a photon with this same energy strikes the excited\natom, it can stimulate the atom to make the transition sooner to the lower state,\nFig. 28-16b. This phenomenon is called stimulated emission: not only do we still\nhave the original photon, but also a second one of the same frequency as a result\n+See also Section 24-3.\n820 CHAPTER 28\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 803, and answer it again now.

These two photons are exactly in phase, and they are\nmoving in the same direction. This is how coherent light is produced in a laser.\nThe name "laser" is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission\nof Radiation.\nNormally, most atoms are in the lower state, so the majority of incident pho-\ntons will be absorbed. To obtain the coherent light from stimulated emission, two\nconditions must be satisfied. First, the atoms must be excited to the higher state so\nthat an inverted population is produced in which more atoms are in the upper\nstate than in the lower one (Fig. 28-17). Then emission of photons will dominate\nover absorption. And second, the higher state must be a metastable state-a state\nin which the electrons remain longer than usualt so that the transition to the lower\nstate occurs by stimulated emission rather than spontaneously.\nFigure 28-18 is a schematic diagram of a laser: the "lasing" material is placed\nin a long narrow tube at the ends of which are two mirrors, one of which is partially\ntransparent (transmitting perhaps 1 or 2%). Some of the excited atoms drop\ndown fairly soon after being excited. One of these is the blue atom shown on the far\nleft in Fig. 28-18. If the emitted photon strikes another atom in the excited state,\nit stimulates this atom to emit a photon of the same frequency, moving in the same\ndirection, and in phase with it. These two photons then move on to strike other\natoms causing more stimulated emission. As the process continues, the number of\nphotons multiplies. When the photons strike the end mirrors, most are reflected\nback, and as they move in the opposite direction, they continue to stimulate more\natoms to emit photons. As the photons move back and forth between the mirrors,\na small percentage passes through the partially transparent mirror at one end.\nThese photons make up the narrow coherent external laser beam. (Inside the\ntube, some spontaneously emitted photons will be emitted at an angle to the axis,\nand these will merely go out the side of the tube and not affect the narrow width\nof the main beam.)\nPartially\ntransparent\nmirror\nMirror\nNormal\npopulation\nInverted\npopulation\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 28-17 Two energy levels\nfor a collection of atoms.

The diffraction spreading can be incredibly small. The light\nenergy, instead of spreading out in space as it does for an ordinary light source, can\nbe a pencil-thin beam.\nCreating an Inverted Population\nThe excitation of the atoms in a laser can be done in several ways to produce the\nnecessary inverted population. In a ruby laser, the lasing material is a ruby rod\nconsisting of Al2O3 with a small percentage of aluminum (Al) atoms replaced by\nchromium (Cr) atoms. The Cr atoms are the ones involved in lasing. In a process\ncalled optical pumping, the atoms are excited by strong flashes of light of wave-\nlength 550 nm, which corresponds to a photon energy of 2.2 eV. As shown in\nFig. 28-19, the atoms are excited from state E, to state E2. The atoms quickly\ndecay either back to E, or to the intermediate state E1, which is metastable with a\nlifetime of about 3 × 10-3 s (compared to 10-8 s for ordinary levels). With strong\npumping action, more atoms can be found in the E1 state than are in the E0 state.\nThus we have the inverted population needed for lasing. As soon as a few atoms\nin the E 1 state jump down to E0 , they emit photons that produce stimulated\nemission of the other atoms, and the lasing action begins. A ruby laser thus emits a\nbeam whose photons have energy 1.8 eV and a wavelength of 694.3 nm (or\n"ruby-red" light).\n+ An excited atom may land in such a state and can jump to a lower state only by a so-called forbidden\ntransition (Section 28-6), which is why its lifetime is longer than normal.\nFIGURE 28-19 Energy levels of\nchromium in a ruby crystal.

The atoms are excited by applying a high voltage to\nthe tube so that an electric discharge takes place within the gas. In the process,\nsome of the He atoms are raised to the metastable state E1 shown in Fig. 28-20,\nwhich corresponds to a jump of 20.61 eV, almost exactly equal to an excited state\nin neon, 20.66 eV. The He atoms do not quickly return to the ground state by\nspontaneous emission, but instead often give their excess energy to a Ne atom\nwhen they collide-see Fig. 28-20. In such a collision, the He drops to the ground\nstate and the Ne atom is excited to the state E3 (the prime refers to neon states).\nThe slight difference in energy (0.05 eV) is supplied by the kinetic energy of the\nmoving atoms. In this manner, the E3 state in Ne-which is metastable-becomes\nmore populated than the E2 level. This inverted population between E2 and E2\nis what is needed for lasing.\nVery common now are semiconductor diode lasers, also called pn junction\nlasers, which utilize an inverted population of electrons between the conduction\nband and the lower-energy valence band (Section 29-9). When an electron jumps\ndown, a photon can be emitted, which in turn can stimulate another electron to\nmake the transition and emit another photon, in phase. The needed mirrors (as in\nFig. 28-18) are made by the polished ends of the pn crystal. Semiconductor lasers\nare used in CD and DVD players (see below), and in many other applications.\nOther types of laser include: chemical lasers, in which the energy input comes\nfrom the chemical reaction of highly reactive gases; dye lasers, whose frequency\nis tunable; CO2 gas lasers, capable of high power output in the infrared; and\nrare-earth solid-state lasers such as the high-power Nd:YAG laser.\nThe excitation of the atoms in a laser can be done continuously or in pulses.\nIn a pulsed laser, the atoms are excited by periodic inputs of energy. In a\ncontinuous laser, the energy input is continuous: as atoms are stimulated to jump\ndown to the lower level, they are soon excited back up to the upper level so the\noutput is a continuous laser beam.\nNo laser is a source of energy. Energy must be put in, and the laser converts\na part of it into an intense narrow beam output.\n*\nApplications\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nDVD and CD players,\nbar codes\nFIGURE 28-21 (a) Reading a CD\n(or DVD).

The laser beam reflects off the stripes and spaces of a bar code, or off the\ntiny pits of a CD or DVD as shown in Fig. 28-21a. The recorded information on a\nCD or DVD is a series of pits and spaces representing Os and 1s (or "off" and "on")\nof a binary code (Section 17-10) that is decoded electronically before being sent\nto the audio or video system. The laser of a CD player starts reading at the inside\nof the disc which rotates at about 500 rpm at the start. As the disc rotates, the\nlaser follows the spiral track (Fig. 28-21b), and as it moves outward the disc must\nslow down because each successive circumference (C = 2mr) is slightly longer\nas r increases; at the outer edge, the disc is rotating about 200 rpm.

The second layer may start reading at the outer edge instead of\ninside. DVDs can also have a single or double layer on both surfaces of the disc.\nLasers are a useful surgical tool. The narrow intense beam can be used to\ndestroy tissue in a localized area, or to break up gallstones and kidney stones.\nBecause of the heat produced, a laser beam can be used to "weld" broken tissue,\nsuch as a detached retina, Fig. 28-22, or to mold the cornea of the eye (by vaporizing\ntiny bits of material) to correct myopia and other eye defects (LASIK surgery). The\nlaser beam can be carried by an optical fiber (Section 23-6) to the surgical point,\nsometimes as an additional fiber-optic path on an endoscope (again Section 23-6).\nAn example is the removal of plaque clogging human arteries. Lasers have been used\nto destroy tiny organelles within a living cell by researchers studying how the\nabsence of that organelle affects the behavior of the cell. Laser beams are used\nto destroy cancerous and precancerous cells; and the heat seals off capillaries\nand lymph vessels, thus "cauterizing" the wound to prevent spread of the disease.\nThe intense heat produced in a small area by a laser beam is used for welding and\nmachining metals and for drilling tiny holes in hard materials. Because a laser beam is\ncoherent, monochromatic, narrow, and essentially parallel, lenses can be used to focus\nthe light into even smaller areas. The precise straightness of a laser beam is also useful\nto surveyors for lining up equipment accurately, especially in inaccessible places.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nMedical and other uses of lasers\n*\n28-12 Holography\nOne of the most interesting applications of laser light is the production of three-\ndimensional images called holograms (see Fig. 28-23). In an ordinary photograph,\nthe film simply records the intensity of light reaching it at each point. When the\nphotograph or transparency is viewed, light reflecting from it or passing through\nit gives us a two-dimensional picture. In holography, the images are formed by\ninterference, without lenses. A laser hologram is typically made on a photographic\nemulsion (film). A broadened laser beam is split into two parts by a half-silvered\nmirror, Fig. 28-24. One part goes directly to the film; the rest passes to the object\nto be photographed, from which it is reflected to the film. Light from every point\non the object reaches each point on the film, and the interference of the two\nbeams allows the film to record both the intensity and relative phase of the light\nat each point. It is crucial that the incident light be coherent-that is, in phase at\nall points-which is why a laser is used. After the film is developed, it is placed\nagain in a laser beam and a three-dimensional image of the object is created. You\ncan walk around such an image and see it from different sides as if it were the\noriginal object. Yet, if you try to touch it with your hand, there will be nothing\nmaterial there.\nHalf-silvered\nmirror\nDirect\nbeam\nFilm\nFIGURE 28-22 Laser being used in\neye surgery.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHolography\nLaser\nlight\nFIGURE 28-23 An athlete (race-car\ndriver) puts his hand on, or through,\na holographic image of himself.\nReflected\nrays\nObject\nFIGURE 28-24 Making a hologram.

The interference pattern in the film emulsion can be thought of as an array\nof bands or ribbons where constructive interference occurred. This array, and the\nreconstruction of the image, can be compared to Bragg scattering of X-rays from\nthe atoms in a crystal (see Section 25-11). White light can reconstruct the image\nbecause the Bragg condition (m) = 2d sin 0) selects out the appropriate single\nwavelength. If the hologram is originally produced by lasers emitting the three\nadditive primary colors (red, green, and blue), the three-dimensional image can\nbe seen in full color when viewed with white light.\nSummary\nIn 1925, Schrödinger and Heisenberg separately worked out a\nnew theory, quantum mechanics, which is now considered to\nbe the fundamental theory at the atomic level. It is a statistical\ntheory rather than a deterministic one.\nAn important aspect of quantum mechanics is the Heisen-\nberg uncertainty principle. It results from the wave-particle\nduality and the unavoidable interaction between an observed\nobject and the observer.\nOne form of the uncertainty principle states that the\nposition x and momentum px of an object cannot both be\nmeasured precisely at the same time. The products of the\nuncertainties, (Ax)(Apx), can be no less than h (= h/2T):\n(Apx) (Ax) = K.\n(28-1)\nAnother form of the uncertainty principle states that the\nenergy can be uncertain (or nonconserved) by an amount AE\nfor a time At, where\n(AE) (At) 2 K.\n(28-2)\nAccording to quantum mechanics, the state of an electron in\nan atom is specified by four quantum numbers: n, l, m, and ms :\n(1) n, the principal quantum number, can take on any integer\nvalue (1, 2, 3, ··· ) and corresponds to the quantum number\nof the old Bohr model;\n(2) ¿, the orbital quantum number, can take on values from 0\nup to n - 1;\n(3) mę, the magnetic quantum number, can take on integer\nvalues from -l to +l;\n(4) ms, the spin quantum number, can be + 2 or - 2.\nThe energy levels in the hydrogen atom depend on n,\nwhereas in other atoms they depend on n and l.\nThe orbital angular momentum of an atom has magnitude\nL = Ve(l + 1) ₺ and z component Lz = męh.\nWhen an external magnetic field is applied, the spectral\nlines are split (the Zeeman effect), indicating that the energy\ndepends also on me in this case.\nEven in the absence of a magnetic field, precise measure-\nments of spectral lines show a tiny splitting of the lines called\nfine structure, whose explanation is that the energy depends\nvery slightly on me and ms .\nTransitions between states that obey the selection rule\nAl = +1 are far more probable than other so-called\nforbidden transitions.\nThe arrangement of electrons in multi-electron atoms is\ngoverned by the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no\ntwo electrons can occupy the same quantum state-that is, they\ncannot have the same set of quantum numbers n, l, me, and ms .\nAs a result, electrons in multi-electron atoms are grouped\ninto shells (according to the value of n) and subshells (according\nto l).\nElectron configurations are specified using the numerical\nvalues of n, and using letters for l: s, p, d, f, etc., for\nl = 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, plus a superscript for the number of\nelectrons in that subshell. Thus, the ground state of hydrogen\nis 1s1, whereas that for oxygen is 1s22s22p4.\nIn the Periodic Table, the elements are arranged in horizontal\nrows according to increasing atomic number (= number of elec-\ntrons in the neutral atom). The shell structure gives rise to a\nperiodicity in the properties of the elements, so that each vertical\ncolumn can contain elements with similar chemical properties.\nX-rays, which are a form of electromagnetic radiation of\nvery short wavelength, are produced when high-speed electrons\nstrike a target. The spectrum of X-rays so produced consists of\ntwo parts, a continuous spectrum produced when the electrons\nare decelerated by atoms of the target, and peaks representing\nphotons emitted by atoms of the target after being excited by\ncollision with the high-speed electrons. Measurement of these\npeaks allows determination of inner energy levels of atoms and\ndetermination of atomic number Z.\n[*Fluorescence occurs when absorbed UV photons are\nfollowed by emission of visible light, due to the special\narrangement of energy levels of atoms of the material.\nPhosphorescent materials have metastable states (long-lived)\nthat emit light seconds or minutes after absorption of light.]\nLasers produce a narrow beam of monochromatic\ncoherent light (light waves in phase).\n[*Holograms are images with a 3-dimensional quality,\nformed by interference of laser light.]\n824 CHAPTER 28 Quantum Mechanics of Atoms\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 803, and answer it again now.
