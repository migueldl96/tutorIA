For one thing, energy is a\nconserved quantity and is thus an important tool for understanding\nnature. Furthermore, we saw that many Problems could be solved using the\nenergy concept even though a detailed knowledge of the forces involved was not\npossible, or when a calculation involving Newton's laws would have been too\ndifficult.\nThe energy point of view can be used in electricity, and it is especially useful.\nIt not only extends the law of conservation of energy, but it gives us another way\nto view electrical phenomena. The energy concept is also a tool in solving Problems\nmore easily in many cases than by using forces and electric fields.\nWe are used to voltage in our\nlives-a 12-volt car battery, 110 V\nor 220 V at home, 1.5-volt flashlight\nbatteries, and so on.

As we saw in Chapter 6, potential energy\ncan be defined only for a conservative force. The work done by a conservative\nforce in moving an object between any two positions is independent of the path\ntaken. The electrostatic force between any two charges (Eq. 16-1, F = kQ1Q2/r2)\nis conservative because the dependence on position is just like the gravitational\nforce (Eq. 5-4), which is conservative. Hence we can define potential energy PE\nfor the electrostatic force.\nWe saw in Chapter 6 that the change in potential energy between any two\npoints, a and b, equals the negative of the work done by the conservative force on\nan object as it moves from point a to point b: APE = - W.\nThus we define the change in electric potential energy, PEb - PEa, when a\npoint charge q moves from some point a to another point b, as the negative of the\nwork done by the electric force on the charge as it moves from point a to point b.\nFor example, consider the electric field between two equally but oppositely charged\nparallel plates; we assume their separation is small compared to their width and\nheight, so the field E will be uniform over most of the region, Fig. 17-1. Now con-\nsider a tiny positive point charge q placed at the point "a" very near the positive\nplate as shown. This charge q is so small that it has no effect on E. If this charge q at\npoint a is released, the electric force will do work on the charge and accelerate it\ntoward the negative plate. The work W done by the electric field E to move the\ncharge a distance d is (using Eq. 16-5, F = qE)\nW = Fd = qEd.\n[uniform Ē]\nThe change in electric potential energy equals the negative of the work done by\nthe electric force:\nPEb - PEa = - qEd\n[uniform Ē] (17-1)\nfor this case of uniform electric field E. In the case illustrated, the potential\nenergy decreases (APE is negative); and as the charged particle accelerates from\npoint a to point b in Fig. 17-1, the particle\'s kinetic energy KE increases-by an\nequal amount. In accord with the conservation of energy, electric potential energy\nis transformed into kinetic energy, and the total energy is conserved. Note that\nthe positive charge q has its greatest potential energy at point a, near the positive\nplate.+ The reverse is true for a negative charge: its potential energy is greatest\nnear the negative plate.\nElectric Potential and Potential Difference\nIn Chapter 16, we found it useful to define the electric field as the force per unit\ncharge. Similarly, it is useful to define the electric potential (or simply the\npotential when "electric" is understood) as the electric potential energy per unit\ncharge. Electric potential is given the symbol V. If a positive test charge q in an\nelectric field has electric potential energy PEa at some point a (relative to some\nzero potential energy), the electric potential Va at this point is\nVa = PEa .\n(17-2a)\nAs we discussed in Chapter 6, only differences in potential energy are physically\nmeaningful. Hence only the difference in potential, or the potential difference,\nbetween two points a and b (such as those shown in Fig. 17-1) is measurable.\n+ At point a, the positive charge q has its greatest ability to do work (on some other object or system).\n474 CHAPTER 17 Electric Potential\n', 'chapter_title': '17-1 Electric Potential Energy and Potential Difference'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'When the electric force does positive work on a charge, the kinetic energy increases\nand the potential energy decreases. The difference in potential energy, PEb - PEa ,\nis equal to the negative of the work, Wba, done by the electric field to move the\ncharge from a to b; so the potential difference Vba is\nVba = Vb - Va =\nPEb - PEa\n=\nWba\n.\n(17-2b)\nq\nq\nNote that electric potential, like electric field, does not depend on our test charge q.\nV depends on the other charges that create the field, not on the test charge q;\nq acquires potential energy by being in the potential V due to the other charges.\n–\nWe can see from our definition that the positive plate in Fig. 17-1 is at a higher\npotential than the negative plate. Thus a positively charged object moves naturally\nfrom a high potential to a low potential. A negative charge does the reverse.\nThe unit of electric potential, and of potential difference, is joules/coulomb\nand is given a special name, the volt, in honor of Alessandro Volta (1745-1827)\nwho is best known for inventing the electric battery. The volt is abbreviated V,\nso 1 V = 1 J/C. Potential difference, since it is measured in volts, is often referred\nto as voltage. (Be careful not to confuse V for volts, with italic V for voltage.)\nIf we wish to speak of the potential Va at some point a, we must be aware\nthat Va depends on where the potential is chosen to be zero. The zero for electric\npotential in a given situation can be chosen arbitrarily, just as for potential energy,\nbecause only differences in potential energy can be measured. Often the ground,\nor a conductor connected directly to the ground (the Earth), is taken as zero\npotential, and other potentials are given with respect to ground. (Thus, a point\nwhere the voltage is 50 V is one where the difference of potential between it and\nground is 50 V.) In other cases, as we shall see, we may choose the potential to be\nzero at an infinite distance.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 17-1\nA negative charge. Suppose a negative\ncharge, such as an electron, is placed near the negative plate in Fig. 17-1, at\npoint b, shown here in Fig. 17-2. If the electron is free to move, will its electric\npotential energy increase or decrease? How will the electric potential change?\nRESPONSE An electron released at point b will be attracted to the positive plate.\nAs the electron accelerates toward the positive plate, its kinetic energy increases,\nso its potential energy decreases: PEa < PEb and APE = PEa - PEb < 0. But\nnote that the electron moves from point b at low potential to point a at higher\npotential: AV = Va - Vb > 0. (Potentials Va and Vo are due to the charges on\nthe plates, not due to the electron.) The signs of APE and AV are opposite\nbecause of the negative charge of the electron.\nNOTE A positive charge placed next to the negative plate at b would stay there,\nwith no acceleration. A positive charge tends to move from high potential to low.\nBecause the electric potential difference is defined as the potential energy\ndifference per unit charge, then the change in potential energy of a charge q\nwhen it moves from point a to point b is\nAPE = PE - PEa = q(Vb - Va) = qVba .\n(17-3)\nThat is, if an object with charge q moves through a potential difference Vba , its\npotential energy changes by an amount qVba . For example, if the potential dif-\nference between the two plates in Fig. 17-1 is 6 V, then a +1 C charge moved\nfrom point b to point a will gain (1 C)(6 V) = 6J of electric potential energy.\n(And it will lose 6 J of electric potential energy if it moves from a to b.) Similarly,\na +2 C charge will gain APE = (2 C)(6 V) = 12 J, and so on. Thus, electric potential\ndifference is a measure of how much energy an electric charge can acquire in a\ngiven situation. And, since energy is the ability to do work, the electric potential\ndifference is also a measure of how much work a given charge can do. The exact\namount of energy or work depends both on the potential difference and on the charge.\n+\n−\nB\nLow\npotential\nVb\nHigh\npotential\n+\n−\nVa\n+\n−\na\nb\nHigh PE\nfor negative\ncharge here\n+\n−\n+\n−\nFIGURE 17-2 Central part of\nFig. 17-1, showing a negative point\ncharge near the negative plate.\nExample 17-1.\nCAUTION\nA negative charge has high PE\nwhen potential V is low\nSECTION 17-1 Electric Potential Energy and Potential Difference 475\n', 'chapter_title': '17-1 Electric Potential Energy and Potential Difference'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': '+\nVa\n−\n+Vba\nVb\n+\n−\nh\nQ\n+\n−\n2Q\n+\n−\n+\n−\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 17-3 (a) Two rocks are at\nthe same height.

The greater the height, h,\nof a cliff, the more potential energy (= mgh) the rock has at the top of the cliff\nrelative to the bottom, and the more kinetic energy it will have when it reaches\nthe bottom. The actual amount of kinetic energy it will acquire, and the amount\nof work it can do, depends both on the height of the cliff and the mass m of the\nrock. A large rock and a small rock can be at the same height h (Fig. 17-3a) and\nthus have the same "gravitational potential," but the larger rock has the greater\npotential energy (it has more mass). The electrical case is similar (Fig. 17-3b):\nthe potential energy change, or the work that can be done, depends both on the\npotential difference (corresponding to the height of the cliff) and on the charge\n(corresponding to mass), Eq. 17-3. But note a significant difference: electric\ncharge comes in two types, + and -, whereas gravitational mass is always +.\nSources of electrical energy such as batteries and electric generators are meant\nto maintain a potential difference. The actual amount of energy transformed by\nsuch a device depends on how much charge flows, as well as the potential dif-\nference (Eq. 17-3). For example, consider an automobile headlight connected\nto a 12.0-V battery. The amount of energy transformed (into light and thermal\nenergy) is proportional to how much charge flows, which in turn depends on how\nlong the light is on. If over a given period of time 5.0 C of charge flows through\nthe light, the total energy transformed is (5.0C)(12.0 V) = 60 J. If the headlight\nis left on twice as long, 10.0 C of charge will flow and the energy transformed is\n(10.0C)(12.0 V) = 120 J. Table 17-1 presents some typical voltages.\nEXAMPLE 17-2\nElectron in TV tube. Suppose an electron is accelerated\nfrom rest through a potential difference Vb - Va = Vba = +5000 V (Fig. 17-4).\n(a) What is the change in electric potential energy of the electron? What is\n(b) the kinetic energy, and (c) the speed of the electron (m = 9.1 × 10-31 kg)\nas a result of this acceleration?\nAPPROACH The electron, accelerated toward the positive plate, will change in\npotential energy by an amount APE = qVba (Eq. 17-3). The loss in potential\nenergy will equal its gain in kinetic energy (energy conservation).\nSOLUTION (a) The charge on an electron is q = - e = - 1.6 × 10-19 C.\nTherefore its change in potential energy is\nAPE = qVba = (-1.6×10-19C)(+5000V) = - 8.0× 10-16 J.\nThe minus sign indicates that the potential energy decreases. The potential\ndifference, Vba , has a positive sign because the final potential Vb is higher than the\ninitial potential Va · Negative electrons are attracted toward a positive electrode\n(or plate) and repelled away from a negative electrode.\n(b) The potential energy lost by the electron becomes kinetic energy KE. From\nconservation of energy (Eq. 6-11a), AKE + APE = 0, so\nAKE = - APE\n2mv2 - 0 = - q(Vb - Va) = - qVba,\nwhere the initial kinetic energy is zero since we are given that the electron\nstarted from rest. So the final KE = - qVba = 8.0 × 10-16 J.\n(c) In the equation just above we solve for v:\nv = V-29mb = 1\n9.1 × 10-31 kg\n2(-1.6×10-19C)(5000V)\n= 4.2 ×107 m/s.\nNOTE The electric potential energy does not depend on the mass, only on the\ncharge and voltage. The speed does depend on m.\nEXERCISE A Instead of the electron in Example 17-2, suppose a proton\n(m = 1.67 × 10-27 kg) was accelerated from rest by a potential difference Vba = - 5000 V.\nWhat would be the proton\'s (a) change in PE, and (b) final speed?\n476 CHAPTER 17 Electric Potential\n', 'chapter_title': '17-1 Electric Potential Energy and Potential Difference'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': "17-2\nRelation between Electric Potential\nand Electric Field\nThe effects of any charge distribution can be described either in terms of electric field\nor in terms of electric potential. Electric potential is often easier to use because it is\na scalar, whereas electric field is a vector. There is an intimate connection between\nthe potential and the field. Let us consider the case of a uniform electric field, such as\nthat between the parallel plates of Fig. 17-1 whose difference of potential is Vba ·\nThe work done by the electric field to move a positive charge q from point a to\npoint b is equal to the negative of the change in potential energy (Eq. 17-2b), so\nW = - q(Vb - Va) = - qVba -\nWe can also write the work done as the force times distance, where the force on q is\nF = qE, so\nW = Fd = qEd,\nwhere d is the distance (parallel to the field lines) between points a and b. We\nnow set these two expressions for W equal and find qVba = - qEd, or\nVba = - Ed.\n[uniform Ē] (17-4a)\nIf we solve for E, we find\nE = - Vba\nd\n[uniform Ē] (17-4b)\nFrom Eq. 17-4b we see that the units for electric field can be written as volts\nper meter (V/m), as well as newtons per coulomb (N/C, from E = F/q). These\nare equivalent because 1 N/C = 1 N ·m/C.m = 1J/C·m = 1V/m. The minus\nsign in Eq. 17-4b tells us that E points in the direction of decreasing potential V.\nEXAMPLE 17-3\nElectric field obtained from voltage.

In general, it is possible to show that the electric field\nin a given direction at any point in space is equal to the rate at which the electric\npotential decreases over distance in that direction. For example, the x component\nof the electric field is given by Er = - AV/Ax, where AV is the change in poten-\ntial over a very short distance Ax.\nBreakdown Voltage\nWhen very high voltages are present, air can become ionized due to the high electric\nfields. Any odd free electron can be accelerated to sufficient kinetic energy to\nknock electrons out of O2 and N2 molecules of the air. This breakdown of air occurs\nwhen the electric field exceeds about 3 × 106 V/m. When electrons recombine with\ntheir molecules, light is emitted. Such breakdown of air is the source of lightning,\nthe spark of a car's spark plug, and even short sparks between your fingers and a\ndoorknob after you walk across a synthetic rug or slide across a car seat (which can\nresult in a significant transfer of charge to you).\nSECTION 17-2 Relation between Electric Potential and Electric Field 477\n", 'chapter_title': '17-1 Electric Potential Energy and Potential Difference'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'B\nE\n−\n+\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +\n−\n−\n+\n−\n−\n+\n−\n+\n−\n+\n+\n−\n−\n20V\n15V I\n10V\n,5VOV\nFIGURE 17-6 Equipotential lines\n(the green dashed lines) between\ntwo charged parallel plates are\nalways perpendicular to the electric\nfield (solid red lines).\nFIGURE 17-7 Equipotential lines\n(green, dashed) are always\nperpendicular to the electric field\nlines (solid red), shown here for two\nequal but oppositely charged\nparticles (an "electric dipole").\n+\n–\n17-3 Equipotential Lines and Surfaces\nThe electric potential can be represented by drawing equipotential lines or, in three\ndimensions, equipotential surfaces. An equipotential surface is one on which all points\nare at the same potential. That is, the potential difference between any two points\non the surface is zero, so no work is required to move a charge from one point on the\nsurface to the other. An equipotential surface must be perpendicular to the electric field\nat any point. If this were not so-that is, if there were a component of E parallel to\nthe surface-it would require work to move the charge along the surface against this\ncomponent of E; and this would contradict the idea that it is an equipotential surface.\nThe fact that the electric field lines and equipotential surfaces are mutually\nperpendicular helps us locate the equipotentials when the electric field lines are\nknown. In a normal two-dimensional drawing, we show equipotential lines, which\nare the intersections of equipotential surfaces with the plane of the drawing. In\nFig. 17-6, a few of the equipotential lines are drawn (dashed green lines) for the\nelectric field (red lines) between two parallel plates at a potential difference of\n20 V. The negative plate is arbitrarily chosen to be zero volts and the potential of\neach equipotential line is indicated. Note that E points toward lower values of V.\nThe equipotential lines for the case of two equal but oppositely charged particles\nare shown in Fig. 17-7 as green dashed lines. (This combination of equal + and -\ncharges is called an "electric dipole," as we saw in Section 16-8; see Fig. 16-32a.)\nUnlike electric field lines, which start and end on electric charges, equipotential\nlines and surfaces are always continuous and never end, and so continue beyond\nthe borders of Figs. 17-6 and 17-7. A useful analogy for equipotential lines is a\ntopographic map: the contour lines are gravitational equipotential lines (Fig. 17-8).\nWe saw in Section 16-9 that there can be no electric field within a conductor in the\nstatic case, for otherwise the free electrons would feel a force and would move. Indeed\nthe entire volume of a conductor must be entirely at the same potential in the static case.\nThe surface of a conductor is thus an equipotential surface. (If it weren\'t, the free\nelectrons at the surface would move, because whenever there is a potential difference\nbetween two points, free charges will move.) This is fully consistent with our result in\nSection 16-9 that the electric field at the surface of a conductor must be perpendicular\nto the surface.\n0\nNo Campfires\nVolca.\nMinaret Mine\nIceberg\nLake\nN50\nFIGURE 17-8 A topographic map (here,\na portion of the Sierra Nevada in California)\nshows continuous contour lines, each of which\nis at a fixed height above sea level.

One electron volt is defined as\nthe energy acquired by a particle carrying a charge whose magnitude equals that\non the electron (q = e) as a result of moving through a potential difference of 1 V.\nThe charge on an electron has magnitude 1.6022 × 10-19C, and the change in potential\nenergy equals qV. So 1 eV is equal to (1.6022 × 10-19C)(1.00V) =1.6022×10-19 J:\n1 eV= 1.6022× 10-19 ~ 1.60 × 10-19 J.\nAn electron that accelerates through a potential difference of 1000 V will lose 1000 e V\nof potential energy and thus gain 1000 e V or 1 keV (kiloelectron volt) of kinetic energy.\n478 CHAPTER 17\n', 'chapter_title': '17-1 Electric Potential Energy and Potential Difference'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': "On the other hand, if a particle with a charge equal to twice the magnitude of the\ncharge on the electron (= 2e = 3.2 × 10-19 C) moves through a potential differ-\nence of 1000 V, its kinetic energy will increase by 2000 eV = 2 keV.\nAlthough the electron volt is handy for stating the energies of molecules and\nelementary particles, it is not a proper SI unit. For calculations, electron volts should\nbe converted to joules using the conversion factor just given. In Example 17-2, for\nexample, the electron acquired a kinetic energy of 8.0 × 10-16 J. We can quote\nthis energy as 5000 eV (= 8.0 × 10-16 J/1.6 × 10-19 J/eV), but when determining\nthe speed of a particle in SI units, we must use the KE in joules (J).\nEXERCISE B What is the kinetic energy of a He2+ ion released from rest and accelerated\nthrough a potential difference of 2.5 kV?

The result is\nV = kg\nsingle point charge\nV = 0 at r = 00\nd\n(17-5)\n=\n1\nQ\nwhere k = 8.99 × 10º N.m2/C2 ~ 9.0 ×109 N.m2/C2. We can think of V here\nas representing the absolute potential at a distance r from the charge Q, where\nV = 0 at r = oo; or we can think of V as the potential difference between r and\ninfinity. (The symbol oo means infinitely far away.) Notice that the potential V\ndecreases with the first power of the distance, whereas the electric field (Eq. 16-4)\ndecreases as the square of the distance. The potential near a positive charge is large\nand positive, and it decreases toward zero at very large distances, Fig. 17-9a. The\npotential near a negative charge is negative and increases toward zero at large\ndistances, Fig. 17-9b.

Since the\nelectric field is a vector, this can be time consuming or complicated.

The electric field lines and equipotential surfaces for a dipole\nwere shown in Fig. 17-7. Because electric dipoles occur often in physics, as well as\nin other disciplines such as molecular biology, it is useful to examine them more\nclosely.\nThe electric potential at an arbitrary point P due to a dipole, Fig. 17-12, is the\nsum of the potentials due to each of the two charges:\nV = K2 + k(-2)\nr + Ar\nr\nr + Ar)\n1\n-\nAr\n= kQ\nr(r + Ar)\n,\nwhere r is the distance from P to the positive charge and r + Ar is the distance\nto the negative charge. This equation becomes simpler if we consider points P\nwhose distance from the dipole is much larger than the separation of the two\ncharges-that is, for r >> l. From Fig. 17-12 we see that Ar = ( cos 0; since\nr > Ar = l cos 0, we can neglect Ar in the denominator as compared to r. Then\nwe obtain\nV ~\nr2\nkQl cos 0\n.\n[dipole; r >> [] (17-6a)\nWe see that the potential decreases as the square of the distance from the dipole,\nwhereas for a single point charge the potential decreases with the first power of\nthe distance (Eq. 17-5). It is not surprising that the potential should fall off faster\nfor a dipole: when you are far from a dipole, the two equal but opposite charges\nappear so close together as to tend to neutralize each other.\nThe product Ql in Eq. 17-6a is referred to as the dipole moment, p, of the\ndipole. Equation 17-6a in terms of the dipole moment is\nkp cos 0\n12\n.\n[dipole; r > [] (17-6b)\nA dipole moment has units of coulomb-meters (C·m), although for molecules a\nsmaller unit called a debye is sometimes used: 1 debye = 3.33 × 10-30 C.m.\nIn many molecules, even though they are electrically neutral, the electrons spend\nmore time in the vicinity of one atom than another, which results in a separation\nof charge. Such molecules have a dipole moment and are called polar molecules.\nWe already saw that water (Fig. 16-4) is a polar molecule, and we have encoun-\ntered others in our discussion of molecular biology (Section 16-10). Table 17-2\ngives the dipole moments for several molecules. The + and - signs indicate on\nwhich atoms these charges lie. The last two entries are a part of many organic\nmolecules and play an important role in molecular biology.\n17-7 Capacitance\nA capacitor is a device that can store electric charge, and normally consists of two\nconducting objects (usually plates or sheets) placed near each other but not\ntouching. Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits and sometimes are\ncalled condensers. Capacitors store charge for later use, such as in a camera flash,\nand as energy backup in devices like computers if the power fails. Capacitors\nalso block surges of charge and energy to protect circuits. Very tiny capacitors\nserve as memory for the "ones" and "zeros" of the binary code in the random\naccess memory (RAM) of computers and other electronic devices (as in\nFig. 17-35). Capacitors serve many other applications as well, some of which we\nwill discuss.\n482 CHAPTER 17 Electric Potential\n', 'chapter_title': '17-1 Electric Potential Energy and Potential Difference'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Insulator\nA\nnichicon\n(200+50v 2200-50v 2200\nhicon\n(a) + d\n(b)\n(c)\nA simple capacitor consists of a pair of parallel plates of area A separated by\na small distance d (Fig. 17-13a). Often the two plates are rolled into the form of a\ncylinder with paper or other insulator separating the plates, Fig. 17-13b; Fig. 17-13c\nis a photo of some actual capacitors used for various applications. In circuit diagrams,\nthe symbol\n=\nor\n[capacitor symbol]\nrepresents a capacitor. A battery, which is a source of voltage, is indicated by the\nsymbol\n1\n[battery symbol]\nwith unequal arms.\nIf a voltage is applied across a capacitor by connecting the capacitor to a bat-\ntery with conducting wires as in Fig. 17-14, the two plates quickly become\ncharged: one plate acquires a negative charge, the other an equal amount of posi-\ntive charge. Each battery terminal and the capacitor plate connected to it are at\nthe same potential. Hence the full battery voltage appears across the capacitor.\nFor a given capacitor, it is found that the amount of charge Q acquired by each\nplate is proportional to the magnitude of the potential difference V between the\nplates:\nQ = CV.\n(17-7)\nThe constant of proportionality, C, in Eq. 17-7 is called the capacitance of\nthe capacitor. The unit of capacitance is coulombs per volt, and this unit is\ncalled a farad (F). Common capacitors have capacitance in the range of 1 pF\n(picofarad = 10-12 F) to 103 uF (microfarad = 10-6F). The relation, Eq. 17-7,\nwas first suggested by Volta in the late eighteenth century.\nIn Eq. 17-7 and from now on, we will use simply V (in italics) to represent a\npotential difference, such as that produced by a battery, rather than Vba, AV, or\nVb - Va, as previously.\nAlso, be sure not to confuse italic letters V and C which stand for voltage and\ncapacitance, with non-italic V and C which stand for the units volts and coulombs.\nThe capacitance C does not in general depend on Q or V. Its value depends\nonly on the size, shape, and relative position of the two conductors, and also on the\nmaterial that separates them. For a parallel-plate capacitor whose plates have area A\nand are separated by a distance d of air (Fig. 17-13a), the capacitance is given by\nC = ED â:\n[parallel-plate capacitor] (17-8)\nWe see that C depends only on geometric factors, A and d, and not on Q or V.\nWe derive this useful relation in the optional subsection at the end of this Section.\nThe constant Eo is the permittivity of free space, which, as we saw in Chapter 16,\nhas the value 8.85 × 10-12 C2/N · m2.\nEXERCISE E Graphs for charge versus voltage are shown in Fig. 17-15 for three capac-\nitors, A, B, and C.

The\ncharge on each plate is obtained from the definition of capacitance, Eq. 17-7,\nQ = CV. The electric field is uniform, so we can use Eq. 17-4b for the magnitude\nE = V/d.

That is inconven-\niently large. Large-capacitance capacitors will not be simple parallel plates.\nNot long ago, a capacitance greater than a few mF was unusual. Today capacitors\nare available that are 1 or 2 F, yet they are just a few cm on a side. Such capacitors are\nused as power backups, for example, in computer memory and electronics where\nthe time and date can be maintained through tiny charge flow. [Capacitors are\nsuperior to rechargable batteries for this purpose because they can be recharged\nmore than 105 times with no degradation.] Such high-capacitance capacitors can\nbe made of activated carbon which has very high porosity, so that the surface area\nis very large; one-tenth of a gram of activated carbon can have a surface area of\n100 m2. Furthermore, the equal and opposite charges exist in an electric "double\nlayer" about 10-9 m thick. Thus, the capacitance of 0.1 g of activated carbon,\nwhose internal area can be 102 m2, is equivalent to a parallel-plate capacitor with\nC~€0A/d= (8.85 × 10-12 C2/N·m2)(102 m2)/(10-9m) ~ 1F.\nThe proportionality, C & A/d in Eq. 17-8, is valid also for a parallel-plate\ncapacitor that is rolled up into a spiral cylinder, as in Fig. 17-13b. However, the\nconstant factor, €0, must be replaced if an insulator such as paper separates the\nplates, as is usual, as discussed in the next Section.\nOne type of microphone is a condenser, or capacitor, microphone, diagrammed\nin Fig. 17-16. The changing air pressure in a sound wave causes one plate of the\ncapacitor C to move back and forth. The voltage across the capacitor changes at\nthe same frequency as the sound wave.\nSome computer keyboards operate by capacitance. As shown in Fig. 17-17,\neach key is connected to the upper plate of a capacitor. The upper plate moves\ndown when the key is pressed, reducing the spacing between the capacitor plates,\nand increasing the capacitance (Eq. 17-8: smaller d, larger C). The change\nin capacitance results in an electric signal that is detected by an electronic\ncircuit.\n484 CHAPTER 17 Electric Potential\n', 'chapter_title': '17-1 Electric Potential Energy and Potential Difference'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': "*\nDerivation of Capacitance for Parallel-Plate Capacitor\nEquation 17-8 can be derived using the result from Section 16-12 on Gauss's\nlaw, namely that the electric field between two parallel plates is given by Eq. 16-10:\nE = O/A.\nWe combine this with Eq. 17-4a, using magnitudes, V = Ed, to obtain\nv = (2) d.\nA€0\nQ\nThen, from Eq. 17-7, the definition of capacitance,\nA\nc - 2 =\nQ\n2/A\n(Q/ AEo)d\nwhich is Eq. 17-8.\n17-8 Dielectrics\nIn most capacitors there is an insulating sheet of material, such as paper or plastic,\ncalled a dielectric between the plates (Fig. 17-18). This serves several purposes.\nFirst, dielectrics break down (allowing electric charge to flow) less readily than air,\nso higher voltages can be applied without charge passing across the gap. Further-\nmore, a dielectric allows the plates to be placed closer together without touching,\nthus allowing an increased capacitance because d is smaller in Eq. 17-8. Thirdly,\nit is found experimentally that if the dielectric fills the space between the two con-\nductors, it increases the capacitance by a factor K, known as the dielectric constant.\nThus, for a parallel-plate capacitor,\n(17-9)\nThis can be written\nC = Keo d'\nC = € 4 ,\nA\nwhere E = Keo is called the permittivity of the material.\nThe values of the dielectric constant for various materials are given in Table 17-3.\nAlso shown in Table 17-3 is the dielectric strength, the maximum electric field\nbefore breakdown (charge flow) occurs.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 17-9\nInserting a dielectric at constant V. An\nair-filled capacitor consisting of two parallel plates separated by a distance d is\nconnected to a battery of constant voltage V and acquires a charge Q. While it\nis still connected to the battery, a slab of dielectric material with K = 3 is inserted\nbetween the plates of the capacitor. Will Q increase, decrease, or stay the same?\nRESPONSE Since the capacitor remains connected to the battery, the voltage\nstays constant and equal to the battery voltage V. The capacitance C increases\nwhen the dielectric material is inserted because K in Eq. 17-9 has increased.\nFrom the relation Q = CV, if V stays constant, but C increases, Q must increase\nas well. As the dielectric is inserted, more charge will be pulled from the battery\nand deposited onto the plates of the capacitor as its capacitance increases.\nEXERCISE F If the dielectric in Example 17-9 fills the space between the plates, by\nwhat factor does (a) the capacitance change, (b) the charge on each plate change?\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 17-10\nInserting a dielectric into an isolated\ncapacitor. Suppose the air-filled capacitor of Example 17-9 is charged (to Q)\nand then disconnected from the battery. Next a dielectric is inserted between the\nplates.

The capacitance increases as a result of inserting\nthe dielectric (Eq. 17-9). The voltage across the capacitor also changes-it\ndecreases because, by Eq. 17-7, Q = CV, so V = Q/C; if Q stays constant\nand C increases (it is in the denominator), then V decreases.\nFIGURE 17-18 A cylindrical\ncapacitor, unrolled from its case to\nshow the dielectric between the\nplates.

A capacitor C0\nwhose plates are separated by an air gap has a charge +Q on one plate and -Q\non the other (Fig. 17-19a). Assume it is isolated (not connected to a battery) so\ncharge cannot flow to or from the plates. The potential difference between the\nplates, Vo, is given by Eq. 17-7:\nQ = C0V0 ,\nwhere the subscripts refer to air between the plates. Now we insert a dielectric\nbetween the plates (Fig. 17-19b). Because of the electric field between the capac-\nitor plates, the dielectric molecules will tend to become oriented as shown in\nFig. 17-19b. If the dielectric molecules are polar, the positive end is attracted to\nthe negative plate and vice versa. Even if the dielectric molecules are not polar,\nelectrons within them will tend to move slightly toward the positive capacitor\nplate, so the effect is the same. The net effect of the aligned dipoles is a net nega-\ntive charge on the outer edge of the dielectric facing the positive plate, and a net\npositive charge on the opposite side, as shown in Fig. 17-19c.\nSome of the electric field lines, then, do not pass through the dielectric but\ninstead end on charges induced on the surface as shown in Fig. 17-19c. Hence\nthe electric field within the dielectric is less than in air. That is, the electric field\nin the space between the capacitor plates, assumed filled by the dielectric, has\nbeen reduced by some factor K. The voltage across the capacitor is reduced\nby the same factor K because V = Ed (Eq. 17-4) and hence, by Eq. 17-7, Q = CV,\nthe capacitance C must increase by that same factor K to keep Q constant.\n+\n17-9 Storage of Electric Energy\nE0\nE0\n(c)\nFIGURE 17-19 Molecular view of\nthe effects of a dielectric.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nCamera flash\nA charged capacitor stores electric energy by separating + and - charges. The\nenergy stored in a capacitor will be equal to the work done to charge it. The net\neffect of charging a capacitor is to remove charge from one plate and add it to the\nother plate. This is what a battery does when it is connected to a capacitor.\nA capacitor does not become charged instantly. It takes some time, often very little\n(Section 19-6). Initially, when the capacitor is uncharged, no work is required to\nmove the first bit of charge over. As more charge is transferred, work is needed\nto move charge against the increasing voltage V. The work needed to add a small\namount of charge Aq, when a potential difference V is across the plates, is\nAW = V Aq. The total work needed to move total charge Q is equivalent to\nmoving all the charge Q across a voltage equal to the average voltage during\nthe process. (This is just like calculating the work done to compress a spring,\nSection 6-4, page 148.) The average voltage is (Vf - 0)/2 = Vf/2, where Vị is the\nfinal voltage; so the work to move the total charge Q from one plate to the other is\nW = oVs.\nThus we can say that the electric potential energy, PE, stored in a capacitor is\nPE = energy = > QV,\nwhere V is the potential difference between the plates (we dropped the subscript),\nand Q is the charge on each plate.

What is its capacitance?\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 17-12\nCapacitor plate separation increased.\nA parallel-plate capacitor carries charge Q and is then disconnected from a\nbattery. The two plates are initially separated by a distance d. Suppose the plates\nare pulled apart until the separation is 2d. How has the energy stored in this\ncapacitor changed?\ntahgoon\n0 v 660 AF\nEGATIVE\n(PET)\nFIGURE 17-20 A camera flash unit.\nThe 660-uF capacitor is the black\ncylinder.\nRESPONSE If we increase the plate separation d, we decrease the capacitance\naccording to Eq. 17-8, C = €, A/d, by a factor of 2. The charge Q hasn\'t\nchanged. So according to Eq. 17-10, where we choose the form PE = 2Q2/C\nbecause we know Q is the same and C has been halved, the reduced C means\nthe PE stored increases by a factor of 2.\nNOTE We can see why the energy stored increases from a physical point of\nview: the two plates are charged equal and opposite, so they attract each other.\nIf we pull them apart, we must do work, so we raise the potential energy.\nIt is useful to think of the energy stored in a capacitor as being stored in the\nelectric field between the plates. As an example let us calculate the energy stored\nin a parallel-plate capacitor in terms of the electric field.\nWe have seen that the electric field E between two close parallel plates is\nnearly uniform and its magnitude is related to the potential difference by\nV = Ed (Eq. 17-4), where d is the separation. Also, Eq. 17-8 tells us C = €0 A/d\nfor a parallel-plate capacitor. Thus\n1/60 A\nPE = 1CV2 = 1 (EDA) (E2d2)\n= ŽE0 E2Ad.\nThe quantity Ad is the volume between the plates in which the electric field E\nexists. If we divide both sides of this equation by the volume, we obtain an\nexpression for the energy per unit volume or energy density:\nPE\nenergy density =\nvolume\n= ŽE0 E2.\n(17-11)\nThe electric energy stored per unit volume in any region of space is proportional to\nthe square of the electric field in that region. We derived Eq. 17-11 for the special\ncase of a parallel-plate capacitor. But it can be shown to be true for any region of\nspace where there is an electric field. Indeed, we will use this result when we dis-\ncuss electromagnetic radiation (Chapter 22).\nHealth Effects\nThe energy stored in a large capacitance can give you a burn or a shock. One reason\nyou are warned not to touch a circuit, or open an electronic device, is because\ncapacitors may still be carrying charge even if the external power is turned off.\nOn the other hand, the basis of a heart defibrillator is a capacitor charged to\na high voltage. A heart attack can be characterized by fast irregular beating of\nthe heart, known as ventricular (or cardiac) fibrillation. The heart then does not\npump blood to the rest of the body properly, and if the interruption lasts for long,\ndeath results. A sudden, brief jolt of charge through the heart from a defibrillator\ncan cause complete heart stoppage, sometimes followed by a resumption of normal\nbeating. The defibrillator capacitor is charged to a high voltage, typically a few\nthousand volts, and is allowed to discharge very rapidly through the heart via a\npair of wide contacts known as "pads" or "paddles" that spread out the current\nover the chest (Fig. 17-21).\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nShocks, burns, defibrillators\nFIGURE 17-21 Heart defibrillator.\nSECTION 17-9 Storage of Electric Energy\n487\n', 'chapter_title': '17-1 Electric Potential Energy and Potential Difference'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'M\nV\n0\ntime, t\n(a)\nV\n0\n- time, t\n(b)\nFIGURE 17-22 Two kinds of signal\nvoltage: (a) sinusoidal, (b) a pulse,\nboth analog.

A signal voltage varies in time and can also be very brief. For example,\na sound such as a pure tone, which may be sinusoidal as we discussed in\nChapters 11 and 12 (see Figs. 11-24 and 12-14), will produce an output voltage\nfrom a high quality microphone that is also sinusoidal (Fig. 17-22a). That signal\nvoltage is amplified and reaches a loudspeaker, making it produce the sound we\nhear. A signal voltage is sometimes a simple pulse (Fig. 17-22b; see also Figs. 11-23\nand 11-33), and often acts to change some aspect of an electronic device.\nSignal voltages are sent to cell phones ("I\'ve got signal"), to computers from\nthe Internet, or to TV sets with the information on the picture and sound. Not long\nago, signal voltages were analog-the voltage varied continuously, as in Fig. 17-22.\nToday, television and computer signals are digital and use a binary number\nsystem to represent a numerical value. In a normal number, such as 609, there are\nten choices for each digit-from 0 to 9-and normal numbers are called decimal\n(Latin for ten). In a binary number, each digit or bit has only two possibilities,\n0 or 1 (sometimes referred to as "off" or "on"). In binary, 0001 means "one,"\n0010 means 2, 0011 means 3, and 1101 means 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13 in decimal.\nSee Table 17-4, and note that counting starts from the right, just as in regular\ndecimal (the "ones" digit is last, on the far right, then to the left is the "tens" and\nthen "hundreds": for 609, the "ones" are 9, the "hundreds" are 6). Any value can\nbe represented by a voltage pattern something like that shown in Fig. 17-23.\nVoltage\nFIGURE 17-23 A traveling digital signal:\nvoltage vs. position x or time t.

The brightness\nsignal, for example, that goes to each of the millions of tiny picture elements or\n"subpixels" of a TV or computer screen (Fig. 17-31, Section 17-11), is contained\nin a byte. One byte is 8 bits, which means\neach byte of 8 bits allows 28 = 256 possibilities\n(that is, 0 to 255) or 256 shades for each of 3 colors: red, green, blue. The full\ncolor of each pixel (the three subpixel colors) has (256)3 = 17 × 106 possibilities.\nDigital television signals, which we discuss in the next Section, are transmitted\nat about 19 Mb/s = 19 Megabits per second. So 19 × 106 bits pass a given point\nper second, or one bit every 53 nanoseconds. We could write this in terms of\nbytes as 2.4 MB/s, where for bytes we use capital B (and lower-case b for bits).\nWhen an analog signal, such as the pure sine wave of Fig. 17-22a, is converted\nto digital (analog-to-digital converter, ADC), the digital signal may look like the\nblue squared-off curve of Fig. 17-24. The digital signal has a limited number of\ndiscrete values. The difference between the original continuous analog signal and\nits digital approximation is called the quantization error or quantization loss. To min-\nimize that loss, there are two important factors: (i) the resolution or bit depth, which\nis the number of bits or values for the voltage of each sample (= measurement);\n(ii) the sampling rate, which is the number of times per second the original analog\nvoltage is measured ("sampled").\nConsider a digital approximation for a 100-Hz sine wave: Figure 17-24 shows\n(i) a 0 to 6-V, 2-bit depth, measuring only 4 possible voltages (00, 01, 10, 11,\nor 0, 1, 2, 3 in decimal), and (ii) a sampling rate of (9 samples in one cycle or\nwavelength) X (100 cycles/s = 100 Hz) which is 900 samples/s or 900 Hz. This is very\npoor quality. For high quality reproduction, a greater bit depth and higher sampling\nrate are needed, which requires more memory, and more data to be transmitted.\n488 CHAPTER 17\n', 'chapter_title': '17-1 Electric Potential Energy and Potential Difference'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'For audio CDs, the sampling rate is 44.1 kHz (44,100 samplings every second)\nand 16-bit resolution, meaning each sampled voltage can have 28×28 = 216 ~ 65,000\ndifferent voltage levels between, say, 0 and 5 volts. See Fig. 17-25 for details.\nAudio recording today typically uses 96 kHz and 24-bit (224 ~ 17 × 106 voltage\nlevels) to give a better approximation of the original analog signal (on super-CDs\nor solid-state memory), but must be transferred down to 44.1 kHz and 16-bit to\nproduce ordinary CDs. (DVDs can use 192 kHz sampling rate for sound.) But\niPods and MP3 players have lower sampling rates and much less detail, which many\nlisteners can notice.\nFIGURE 17-25 The sine wave shown could represent the analog electric\nsignal from a microphone due to a pure 2000-Hz tone. (See Chapters 11\nand 12.) The analog-to-digital electronics samples the signal-that is,\nmeasures and records the signal\'s voltage at intervals, many times per second.\nEach dot on the curve represents the voltage measured (sampled) at that\npoint. The sampling rate in this diagram is 44,100 each second, or 44.1 kHz,\nlike a CD. That is, a sample is taken every (1 s)/44,100 = 0.000023 s = 0.023 ms.\nIn 0.50 ms, as shown here, 22 samples (black dots) are taken. This is an\nalternate way to represent sampling compared to Fig. 17-24, and shows that\nwe cannot see any changes that might happen between the samplings (dots).\nV\n>-\nVoltage\n0\nt\n0.25 ms\n·0.50 ms\nFigure 17-25 gives some details about a pure 2000-Hz sound sampled at\n44.1 kHz. Normal musical sounds are a complex summation of many such sine\nwaves of different frequencies and amplitudes. A simple summation was shown in\nFig. 12-14. Another example is shown in Fig. 17-26, where we can see that the\nfine details may be missed by a digital conversion. Look at Fig. 17-25: if that were\n20,000 Hz (highest frequency of human hearing), it would be sampled only about\ntwo times per wavelength. Both those samples might be zero volts-obviously missing\nthe entire waveform. Over many wavelengths, it might eventually reproduce the\nwaveform somewhat well. But many sounds only last milliseconds, like the initial\nattack of a piano note or plucked guitar string. Many audiophiles hear the difference\nbetween an original vinyl record and its subsequent release as a CD at 44.1 KHz.\nDigital audio signals must be converted back to analog (digital-to-analog converter,\nDAC) before being sent to a loudspeaker or headset. Even in a TV, the digital\nsignals are converted to analog voltages before addressing the pixels (next\nSection), although the picture itself might be said to be digital since it is made up\nof separate pixels.\nDigital photographs are made up of millions of "pixels" to produce a sharp\nimage that is not "pixelated" or blurry. Also important (and complicated) are the\nnumber of bits provided for colors, plus the ability of the sensors (Chapter 25) to\nsustain a wide range of brightnesses under dim and bright light conditions.\nDigital data has some real advantages: for one, it can be compressed, in the\nsense that repeated information can be reduced so that less memory space is\nrequired-fewer bits and bytes. For example, adjacent "pixels" on a photograph\nthat includes a blue sky may be essentially identical. If 200 almost identical pixels\ncan be coded as identical, that takes up less memory (or "size") than to specify all\nthe 200 pixels individually. Compression schemes, like jpeg for photos, lose some\ninformation and may be noticeable. In audio, MP3 players use one-tenth the space\nthat a CD does, but many listeners don\'t notice. Compression is one reason that\nmore data or "information" can be transmitted digitally for a given bandwidth.\n[Bandwidth is the fixed range of frequencies allotted to each radio or TV station\nor Internet connection, and limits the number of bits transmitted per second.]\nIn audio, many listeners claim that digital does not match analog in full sound\nquality. And what about movies? Will digital ever match Technicolor?\n*\nNoise\nDigital information transmission has another advantage: any distortion or unwanted\n(external) electrical signal that intrudes from outside, broadly called noise, can\nbadly corrupt an analog signal: Fig. 17-27a shows a time-varying analog signal, and\nFig. 17-27b shows nasty outside noise interfering with it. But a digital signal is\nstill readable unless the noise is very large, on the order of half the bit signal itself\n(Figs. 17-27c and d).\nFIGURE 17-26 This type of complex\nsignal is much more normal than the\npure sine wave of Fig. 17-25.\nSampling may not catch all the details,\nespecially because the waveform is\nchanging very fast in time.\nV\n1\n0\nt\nFIGURE 17-27 (a) Original analog\nsignal and (b) the same signal dirtied up\nby outside signals (= noise).

Two years later it was tough to\nfind a new CRT set to buy. Even though new TV sets are flat screen plasma or\nliquid crystal displays (LCD), an understanding of how a CRT works is useful.\n*\nCRT\nBattery\nFIGURE 17-28 If the cathode inside\nthe evacuated glass tube is heated to\nglowing (by an electric current, not\nshown), negatively charged\n"cathode rays" (= electrons) are\n"boiled off" and flow across to the\nanode (+), to which they are\nattracted.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nCRT\nThe operation of a CRT depends on thermionic emission, discovered by Thomas\nEdison (1847-1931). Consider a voltage applied to two small electrodes inside an\nevacuated glass "tube" as shown in Fig. 17-28: the cathode is negative, and the\nanode is positive. If the cathode is heated (usually by an electric current) so that\nit becomes hot and glowing, it is found that negative charges leave the cathode\nand flow to the positive anode. These negative charges are now called electrons,\nbut originally they were called cathode rays because they seemed to come from\nthe cathode (more detail in Section 27-1 on the discovery of the electron).\nFigure 17-29 is a simplified sketch of a CRT which is contained in an evacuated\nglass tube. A beam of electrons, emitted by the heated cathode, is accelerated by\nthe high-voltage anode and passes through a small hole in that anode. The inside\nof the tube face on the right (the screen) is coated with a fluorescent material that\nglows at the spot where the electrons hit. Voltage applied across the horizontal\nand vertical deflection plates, Fig. 17-29, can be varied to deflect the electron beam\nto different spots on the screen.\nHorizontal\ndeflection plates\nCathode\nAnode\nFluorescent\nscreen\nFIGURE 17-29 A cathode-ray\ntube.

Thus the varying grid\nvoltage is responsible for the brightness of each spot on the screen. At the end of\neach horizontal sweep of the electron beam, the horizontal deflection voltage\nchanges dramatically to bring the beam back to the opposite side of the screen,\nand the vertical voltage changes slightly so the beam begins a new horizontal\nsweep slightly below the previous one. The difference in brightness of the spots on\nthe screen forms the "picture." Color screens have red, green, and blue phosphors\nwhich glow when struck by the electron beam. The various brightnesses of adjacent\nred, green, and blue phosphors (so close together we don\'t distinguish them)\nproduce almost any color. Analog TV for the U.S. provided 480 visible horizontal\nsweepst to form a complete picture every 30 s. With 30 new frames or pictures\nevery second (25 in countries with 50-Hz line voltage), a "moving picture" is displayed\non the TV screen. (Note: commercial movies on film are 24 frames per second.)\nFIGURE 17-30 Electron beam sweeps\nacross a CRT television screen in a\nsuccession of horizontal lines, referred\nto as a raster. Each horizontal sweep\nis made by varying the voltage on the\nhorizontal deflection plates (Fig. 17-29).\nThen the electron beam is moved\ndown a short distance by a change in\nvoltage on the vertical deflection\nplates, and the process is repeated.\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+525 lines in total, but only 480 form the picture; the other 45 lines contain other information such as\nsynchronization.

Each pixel\nconsists of 3 subpixels, a red, a green, and a blue. A close up of a common arrange-\nment of pixels is shown in Fig. 17-31 for an LCD screen. (How liquid crystals work\nin an LCD screen is described in Section 24-11.) Subpixels are so small that at\nnormal viewing distances we don\'t distinguish them and the separate red (R),\ngreen (G), and blue (B) subpixels blend to produce almost any color, depending\non the relative brightnesses of the three subpixels. Liquid crystals act as filters\n(R, G, and B) that filter the light from a white backlight, usually fluorescent\nlamps or light-emitting diodes (LED, Section 29-9) .* The picture you see on\nthe screen depends on the level of brightness of each subpixel, as suggested in\nFig. 17-32 for a simple black and white picture.\nHigh definition (HD) television screens have 1080 horizontal rows of pixels,\neach row consisting of 1920 pixels across the screen. That is, there are 1920 vertical\ncolumns, for a total of nearly 2 million pixels. Today, television in the U.S. is trans-\nmitted digitally at a rate of 60 Hz-that is, 60 frames or pictures per second (50 Hz\nin many countries) which makes the "moving picture." To form one frame, each\nsubpixel must have the correct brightness. We now describe one way of doing this.\nThe brightness of each LCD subpixel (Section 24-11) depends on the voltage\nbetween its front and its back: if this voltage AV is zero, that subpixel is at maximum\nbrightness; if AV is at its maximum (which might be +5 volts), that subpixel is dark.\nGiving the correct voltage (to provide the correct brightness) is called\naddressing the subpixel. Typically the front of the subpixel is maintained at a\npositive voltage, such as +5 V. On the back of the display, the voltage at each\nsubpixel is provided at the intersection of the 1080 horizontal wires (rows) and\n1920 × 3 (colors) ~ 6000 vertical wires (columns). See Fig. 17-33, which shows the\narray, or matrix, of wires. Each intersection of one vertical and one horizontal wire\nlies behind one subpixel. Because many frames are shown per second, the signal\nvoltages applied are brief, like a pulse (see Fig. 17-22b or 11-23).\nRGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB\n0 V\n0 V\n0V\n0V\n0 V\n0 V\nThis pixel, with\nall 3 colors shining,\nwould appear white\nat viewing distances\n0 V\n20 V\n0 V\n0 V\n0 V\n0 V\n0 V\n0 V\n0 V\nThe video signal that arrives at the display activates only one horizontal wire at\na time (the orange one in Fig. 17-33): that one horizontal wire has a voltage (let\'s\nsay +20 V) whereas all the others are at 0 V. That 20 V is not applied directly to\nthe pixels, but allows the vertical wires to apply briefly the proper "signal voltage" to\neach subpixel along that row (via a transistor, see below). These signal voltages,\nknown as the data stream, are applied to all the vertical wires just as that one row is\nactivated: they provide the correct brightness for each subpixel in that activated row.\nA few subpixels are highlighted in Fig. 17-33. Immediately afterward, the other\nrows are activated, one by one, until the entire frame has been completed (in ( s).\n*LEDs are discussed in Section 29-9. Home TVs advertised as LED generally mean an LCD screen\nwith an LED backlight. LED pixels small enough for home screens are difficult to make, but actual\nLED screens are found in very large displays such as at stadiums.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHow flat screens work\nFIGURE 17-32 Example of an\nimage made up of many small\nsquares or pixels (picture elements).\nThis one has rather low resolution.\nFIGURE 17-33 Array of wires\n(a matrix) behind all the pixels on an\nLCD screen. Each intersection of two\nwires is at a subpixel (red, green, or\nblue). One horizontal wire is activated\nat a time (the orange one at the\nmoment shown) meaning it is at a\npositive voltage (+20 V) which\nallows that one row of pixels to be\naddressed at that moment; all\nother horizontal wires are at 0 V. At\nthis moment, the data stream arrives\nto all the vertical wires, presenting the\nneeded voltage (between 0 and 5 V)\nto produce the correct brightness for\neach of the nearly 6000 subpixels along\nthe activated row.\n*SECTION 17-11 491\n', 'chapter_title': '17-1 Electric Potential Energy and Potential Difference'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'connected to\nsubpixel\nDRAIN\nGATE\nattached to\nhorizontal wire\nSOURCE\nconnected to\nvertical wire\nFIGURE 17-34 Thin-film transistor.\nOne is attached to each screen\nsubpixel.\nThen a new frame is started. The addressing of subpixels for each row of each frame\nserves the same purpose as the sweep of the electron beam in a CRT, Fig. 17-30.\n*\nActive Matrix (advanced)\nHigh-definition displays use an active matrix, meaning that a tiny thin-film\ntransistor (TFT) is attached to a corner of the back of each subpixel. (Transistors\nare discussed in Section 29-10.) One electrode of each TFT, called the "source," is\nconnected to the vertical wire which addresses that subpixel, Fig. 17-34, and the\n"drain" electrode is connected to the back of the subpixel. The horizontal wire that\nserves the subpixel is connected to the transistor\'s gate electrode. The gate\'s voltage,\nby attracting charge or not, functions as a switch to connect or disconnect the source\nvoltage to the drain and to the back of the subpixel (its front is fixed at +5 V).\nThe potential difference AV across a subpixel determines if that subpixel will be\nbright in color (AV = 0), black (AV = maximum), or something in between. See\nFig. 17-35. All the subpixel TFTs along the one activated horizontal wire (the orange\none in Fig. 17-33) will have +20 V at the gate: the TFTs are turned "on," like a\nswitch. That allows electric charge to flow, connecting the vertical wire signal volt-\nage at each TFT source to its drain and to the back of the subpixel. Thus all\nsubpixels along one row receive the brightness needed for that line of the frame.\n-\nFIGURE 17-35 Circuit diagram for one subpixel. The\nfront of the subpixel is at +5 V. If the TFT gate is at 20 V\n(horizontal wire activated), the data stream voltage is applied\nto the back of the subpixel, and determines the brightness of that\nsubpixel. If the gate is at 0 V (horizontal wire not activated), the\nTFT is "off": no charge passes through, and the capacitance\nhelps maintain AV until the subpixel is updated 50 s later.\nSubpixel\nC\nHH\n+5 V\n+20 V\nor\n0 V\nTFT\nFIGURE 17-36 An electrocardiogram\n(ECG) trace displayed on a CRT.\n0-00\n76\nPleta\nJuin\n75/ain\n99\nData stream\nvoltage\n(vertical wire)\nWithin a subpixel\'s electronics is a capacitance that helps maintain the AV until\nthat subpixel is updated with a new signal for the next frame, 60 s later (~ 17 ms).\nThe row below the orange one shown in Fig. 17-33 is activated about 15 us later\n[= (6% s) (1080 lines)]. The 6000 vertical wires (data lines) get their signal voltages\n(data stream) updated just before each row is activated in order to establish the\nbrightness of each subpixel in that next row. All 1080 rows are activated, one-by-one,\nwithin 60 s (~ 17 ms) to complete that frame. Then a new frame is started.\nNew TV sets today can often refresh the screen at a higher rate. A refresh rate\nof 120 Hz (or 240 Hz) means that frames are interpolated between the normal ones,\nby averaging, which produces less blurring in fast action scenes.\nDigital TV is transmitted at about 19 Mb/s (19 megabits/s) as mentioned in Sec-\ntion 17-10.

The changes in potential are small, on the order of millivolts (mV), and must\nbe amplified. They are displayed with a chart recorder on paper, or on a monitor\n(CRT or LCD), Fig. 17-36. An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is the record of\nthe potential changes for a given person\'s heart.

The amount of charge\ndepends on the size of the cell, but is approximately 10-3 C/m2 of surface. For a cell\nwhose surface area is 10-5 m2, the total charge on either surface is thus ~ 10-8 ℃. Just\nbefore the contraction of heart muscles, changes occur in the cell wall, so that posi-\ntive ions on the exterior of the cell are able to pass through the wall and neutralize\ncharge on the inside, or even make the inside surface slightly positive compared to the\nexterior. This "depolarization" starts at one end of the cell and progresses toward the\nopposite end, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 17-38b, until the whole muscle is depolar-\nized; the muscle then repolarizes to its original state (Fig. 17-38a), all in less than a\nsecond. Figure 17-38c shows rough graphs of the potential V as a function of time at\nthe two points P and P\' (on either side of this cell) as the depolarization moves across\nthe cell. The path of depolarization within the heart as a whole is more complicated,\nand produces the complex potential difference as a function of time, Fig. 17-37.\nFIGURE 17-38 Heart muscle cell\nshowing (a) charge dipole layer in\nresting state; (b) depolarization of\ncell progressing as muscle begins to\ncontract; and (c) potential V at\npoints P and P\' as a function of time.\n+\n+\n+\n–\n–\nIt is standard procedure to divide a typical electrocardiogram into regions\ncorresponding to the various deflections (or "waves"), as shown in Fig. 17-37.\nEach of the deflections corresponds to the activity of a particular part of the heart\nbeat (Fig. 10-42). The P wave corresponds to contraction of the atria. The QRS\ngroup corresponds to contraction of the ventricles as the depolarization follows\na very complicated path.
