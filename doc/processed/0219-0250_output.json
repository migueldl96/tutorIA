We\ndiscussed the kinematics and dynamics of translational motion (the role\nof force). We also discussed the energy and momentum for translational\nmotion. In this Chapter we will deal with rotational motion. We will discuss the\nkinematics of rotational motion and then its dynamics (involving torque), as well\nas rotational kinetic energy and angular momentum (the rotational analog of\nlinear momentum). Our understanding of the world around us will be increased\nsignificantly-from rotating bicycle wheels and compact discs to amusement park\nrides, a spinning skater, the rotating Earth, and a centrifuge-and there may be a\nfew surprises.\nU\nWe will consider mainly the rotation of rigid objects about a fixed axis.\nA rigid object is an object with a definite shape that doesn't change, so that the\nparticles composing it stay in fixed positions relative to one another. Any real\nobject is capable of vibrating or deforming when a force is exerted on it. But these\neffects are often very small, so the concept of an ideal rigid object is very useful as\na good approximation.\n", 'chapter_title': '8-1 Angular Quantities'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': '8-1 Angular Quantities\n-\n-\nThe motion of a rigid object can be analyzed as the translational motion of the\nobject\'s center of mass, plus rotational motion about its center of mass (Section 7-8).\nWe have already discussed translational motion in detail, so now we focus on\npurely rotational motion. By purely rotational motion we mean that all points in\nthe object move in circles, such as the point P in the rotating wheel of Fig. 8-1,\nand that the centers of these circles all lie on one line called the axis of rotation.\nIn Fig. 8-1 the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the page and passes through\npoint O.\nEvery point in an object rotating about a fixed axis moves in a circle (shown\ndashed in Fig. 8-1 for point P) whose center is on the axis of rotation and whose\nradius is r, the distance of that point from the axis of rotation. A straight line\ndrawn from the axis to any point in the object sweeps out the same angle 0 in the\nsame time interval.\nTo indicate the angular position of a rotating object, or how far it has rotated,\nwe specify the angle 0 of some particular line in the object (red in Fig. 8-1) with\nrespect to a reference line, such as the x axis in Fig. 8-1. A point in the object,\nsuch as P in Fig. 8-1, moves through an angle 0 when it travels the distance l\nmeasured along the circumference of its circular path. Angles are commonly\nmeasured in degrees, but the mathematics of circular motion is much simpler if\nwe use the radian for angular measure. One radian (abbreviated rad) is defined\nas the angle subtended by an arc whose length is equal to the radius. For\nexample, in Fig. 8-1b, point P is a distance r from the axis of rotation, and it has\nmoved a distance ( along the arc of a circle. The arc length ( is said to "subtend"\nthe angle 0. In radians, any angle 0 is given by\n0 = 2 ,\n[0 in radians] (8-1a)\nwhere r is the radius of the circle, and ( is the arc length subtended by the angle 0\nspecified in radians. If ( = r, then 0 = 1 rad.\nThe radian is dimensionless since it is the ratio of two lengths. Nonetheless\nwhen giving an angle in radians, we always mention rad to remind us it is not\ndegrees. It is often useful to rewrite Eq. 8-1a in terms of arc length l:\nl = rf.\n(8-1b)\nRadians can be related to degrees in the following way. In a complete circle there\nare 360°, which must correspond to an arc length equal to the circumference of the\ncircle, l = 2mr. For a full circle, 0 = l/r = 2mr/r = 21 rad. Thus\n360° = 2Tr rad.\nOne radian is then 360°/2TT ~ 360º/6.28 ~ 57.3º. An object that makes one\ncomplete revolution (rev) has rotated through 360°, or 2 radians:\n1 rev = 360° = 27 rad.\nEXAMPLE 8-1\nBike wheel. A bike wheel rotates 4.50 revolutions.

Since r = 100m and\n0 = 3 × 10-4 rad, we find\nl = r$ = (100 m)(3 × 10-4 rad) = 3 × 10-2 m = 3 cm.\nA bird can distinguish a small mouse (about 3 cm long) from a height of 100 m.\nThat is good eyesight.\nNOTE Had the angle been given in degrees, we would first have had to convert\nit to radians to make this calculation. Equations 8-1 are valid only if the angle is\nspecified in radians. Degrees (or revolutions) won't work.\nTo describe rotational motion, we make use of angular quantities, such as\nangular velocity and angular acceleration. These are defined in analogy to the\ncorresponding quantities in linear motion, and are chosen to describe the rotat-\ning object as a whole, so they are the same for each point in the rotating object.\nEach point in a rotating object may also have translational velocity and acceleration,\nbut they have different values for different points in the object.\nWhen an object such as the bicycle wheel in Fig. 8-3 rotates from some\ninitial position, specified by 01, to some final position, 02, its angular displacement\nis\nA0 = 02 - 01.\nThe angular velocity (denoted by @, the Greek lowercase letter omega) is\ndefined in analogy with linear (translational) velocity that was discussed in\nChapter 2. Instead of linear displacement, we use the angular displacement. Thus\nthe average angular velocity of an object rotating about a fixed axis is defined as\n6 =\nAt\n,\n(8-2a)\nwhere 40 is the angle through which the object has rotated in the time interval At.\nThe instantaneous angular velocity is the limit of this ratio as At approaches zero:\n@ =\nlim\nAt ->0 At\n02\n.\n--\n(b)\n01\nx\n(8-2b)\nAngular velocity is generally specified in radians per second (rad/s). Note that all\npoints in a rigid object rotate with the same angular velocity, since every position\nin the object moves through the same angle in the same time interval.\nAn object such as the wheel in Fig. 8-3 can rotate about a fixed axis either\nclockwise or counterclockwise. The direction can be specified with a + or - sign.\nThe usual convention is to choose the angular displacement 40 and angular velocity @\nas positive when the wheel rotates counterclockwise. If the rotation is clockwise,\nthen 0 would decrease, so 40 and @ would be negative.\n*Even for an angle as large as 15°, the error in making this estimate is only 1%, but for larger angles\nthe error increases rapidly. (The chord is the straight-line distance between the ends of the arc.)\n200 CHAPTER 8 Rotational Motion\n", 'chapter_title': '8-1 Angular Quantities'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Angular acceleration (denoted by a, the Greek lowercase letter alpha), in analogy\nto linear acceleration, is defined as the change in angular velocity divided by the\ntime required to make this change.

Thus, w and a are properties of the rotating object\nas a whole. With @ measured in radians per second and t in seconds, « has units\nof radians per second squared (rad/s2).\nEach point or particle of a rotating object has, at any moment, a linear velocity v\nand a linear acceleration a. We can now relate the linear quantities at each point,\nv and a, to the angular quantities, w and a, for a rigid object rotating about a\nfixed axis. Consider a point P located a distance r from the axis of rotation, as in\nFig. 8-4. If the object rotates with angular velocity @, any point will have a linear\nvelocity whose direction is tangent to its circular path. The magnitude of that\npoint\'s linear velocity is v = Al/At.

But the\ntwo points have different linear\nvelocities because they travel\ndifferent distances in the same time\ninterval. Since v = rw and\n"B > rA, then VB > VA.\nIn this very useful Eq. 8-4, r is the distance of a point from the rotation axis\nand w is given in rad/s. Thus, although @ is the same for every point in the rotating\nobject at any instant, the linear velocity v is greater for points farther from the\naxis (Fig. 8-5).

(a) Which child\nhas the greater linear velocity? (b) Which child has the greater angular velocity?\nθ\nO\nRESPONSE (a) The linear velocity is the distance traveled divided by the time\ninterval. In one rotation the child on the outer edge travels a longer distance\nthan the child near the center, but the time interval is the same for both. Thus the\nchild at the outer edge, on the horse, has the greater linear velocity.\n(b) The angular velocity is the angle of rotation of the carousel as a whole divided\nby the time interval. For example, in one rotation both children rotate through the\nsame angle (360° or 2Tr radians). The two children have the same angular velocity.\nIf the angular velocity of a rotating object changes, the object as a whole-\nand each point in it-has an angular acceleration. Each point also has a linear\nacceleration whose direction is tangent to that point\'s circular path.

A carousel is initially at rest.\nAt t = 0 it is given a constant angular acceleration a = 0.060 rad/s2, which\nincreases its angular velocity for 8.0 s.

With this w, we determine the\nlinear velocity using Eq. 8-4, v = rw.\nSOLUTION (a) In Eq. 8-3a, a = (@2 - @1)/ At, we put At = 8.0s, a =\n0.060 rad/s2, and @1 = 0.

The\nfrequency is the number of complete revolutions (rev) per second, as we saw in\nChapter 5. One revolution (of a wheel, say) corresponds to an angle of 2Tr radians,\nand thus 1 rev/s = 2Tr rad/s. Hence, in general, the frequency f is related to the\nangular velocity @ by\nf = w\nor\n@ = 2mf.\n(8-7)\nThe unit for frequency, revolutions per second (rev/s), is given the special name\nthe hertz (Hz). That is,\n1 Hz = 1 rev/s.\nNote that "revolution" is not really a unit, so we can also write 1 Hz = 1 s-1.\nThe time required for one complete revolution is called the period T, and it\nis related to the frequency by\nT = 1.\n(8-8)\nIf a particle rotates at a frequency of three revolutions per second, then the\nperiod of each revolution is 3 S.\nEXERCISE A In Example 8-4 we found that the carousel, after 8.0 s, rotates at an\nangular velocity @ = 0.48 rad/s, and continues to do so after t = 8.0 s because the\nacceleration ceased. What are the frequency and period of the carousel when rotating\nat this constant angular velocity @ = 0.48 rad/s?\n8-2 Constant Angular Acceleration\nIn Chapter 2, we derived the useful kinematic equations (Eqs. 2-11) that relate\nacceleration, velocity, distance, and time for the special case of uniform linear\nacceleration. Those equations were derived from the definitions of linear\nvelocity and acceleration, assuming constant acceleration. The definitions of\nangular velocity and angular acceleration (Eqs. 8-2 and 8-3) are just like those\nfor their linear counterparts, except that 0 replaces the linear displacement x,\n@ replaces v, and a replaces a. Therefore, the angular equations for\nconstant angular acceleration will be analogous to Eqs. 2-11 with x replaced\nby 0, v by w, and a by a, and they can be derived in exactly the same way.\nSECTION 8-2 Constant Angular Acceleration 203\n', 'chapter_title': '8-1 Angular Quantities'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': "We summarize these angular equations here, opposite their linear equivalents,\nEqs. 2-11 (for simplicity we choose 00 = 0 and x0 = 0 at the initial time to = 0):\nAngular\nLinear\nKinematic equations\n@ = 00 + at\nv = Vo + at\nfor constant\nA = wot + 2 at2\nx = Vot + zat2\nangular acceleration\n02 = 03 + 200\nv2 = vå + 2ax\n[X] = 0, 00 = 0]\n13\n2\nv + 00\n0= 2\n[constant a, a] (8-9a)\n[constant a, a] (8-9b)\n[constant a, a] (8-9c)\n[constant a, a] (8-9d)\nNote that wo represents the angular velocity at to = 0, whereas 0 and @ represent\nthe angular position and velocity, respectively, at time t.

Rolling without slipping depends on static friction between the rolling object\nand the ground. The friction is static because the rolling object's point of contact\nwith the ground is at rest at each moment.\nRolling without slipping involves both rotation and translation. There is a simple\nrelation between the linear speed v of the axle and the angular velocity @ of the\nrotating wheel or sphere: namely, v = rw (where r is the radius) as we now show.\n204 CHAPTER 8 Rotational Motion\n", 'chapter_title': '8-1 Angular Quantities'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Figure 8-8a shows a wheel rolling to the right without slipping.

In Fig. 8-8b we have put ourselves in the reference\nframe of the wheel-that is, we are moving to the right with velocity v relative to\nthe ground. In this reference frame the axle C is at rest, whereas the ground and\npoint P are moving to the left with velocity -v as shown. In Fig. 8-8b we are\nseeing pure rotation. So we can use Eq. 8-4 to obtain v = rw, where r is the\nradius of the wheel.

Just as we found\nanalogies between linear and rotational motion for the description of motion, so\nrotational equivalents for dynamics exist as well.\nTo make an object start rotating about an axis clearly requires a force. But\nthe direction of this force, and where it is applied, are also important. Take, for\nexample, an ordinary situation such as the overhead view of the door in Fig. 8-10.\nIf you apply a force FA perpendicular to the door as shown, you will find that the\ngreater the magnitude, FA, the more quickly the door opens. But now if you apply\nthe same force at a point closer to the hinge-say, FB in Fig. 8-10-the door\nwill not open so quickly. The effect of the force is less: where the force acts, as\nwell as its magnitude and direction, affects how quickly the door opens. Indeed,\nif only this one force acts, the angular acceleration of the door is proportional\nnot only to the magnitude of the force, but is also directly proportional to\nthe perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line along which the\nforce acts. This distance is called the lever arm, or moment arm, of the force,\nand is labeled ra and ry for the two forces in Fig. 8-10. Thus, if rA in Fig. 8-10\nis three times larger than rB, then the angular acceleration of the door will be\nthree times as great, assuming that the magnitudes of the forces are the same.\nTo say it another way, if rA = 3r, then FB must be three times as large as FA to\ngive the same angular acceleration. (Figure 8-11 shows two examples of tools\nwhose long lever arms are very effective.)\nThe angular acceleration, then, is proportional to the product of the force\ntimes the lever arm. This product is called the moment of the force about the\naxis, or, more commonly, it is called the torque, and is represented by T (Greek\nlowercase letter tau). Thus, the angular acceleration « of an object is directly\nproportional to the net applied torque T:\na & T,\nand we see that it is torque that gives rise to angular acceleration. This is the\nrotational analog of Newton\'s second law for linear motion, a xx F.\nWe defined the lever arm as the perpendicular distance from the axis of rota-\ntion to the line of action of the force-that is, the distance which is perpendicular\nboth to the axis of rotation and to an imaginary line drawn along the direction of\nthe force. We do this to take into account the effect of forces acting at an angle. It\nis clear that a force applied at an angle, such as Fc in Fig. 8-12, will be less effec-\ntive than the same magnitude force applied perpendicular to the door, such as FA\n(Fig. 8-12a). And if you push on the end of the door so that the force is directed\nat the hinge (the axis of rotation), as indicated by FD, the door will not rotate at all.\nThe lever arm for a force such as Fc is found by drawing a line along the\ndirection of Fc (this is the "line of action" of Fc). Then we draw another line,\nperpendicular to this line of action, that goes to the axis of rotation and is\nperpendicular also to it. The length of this second line is the lever arm for Fc and\nis labeled rc in Fig. 8-12b. The lever arm for FA is the full distance from the hinge\nto the doorknob, rA (just as in Fig. 8-10). Thus rc is much smaller than rA.\nO\nB\n(a)\nFA\nFIGURE 8-12 (a) Forces acting at\ndifferent angles at the doorknob.

This short lever\narm rc and the corresponding smaller torque associated with Fc are consistent\nwith the observation that Fc is less effective in accelerating the door than is FA\nwith its larger lever arm. When the lever arm is defined in this way, experiment\nshows that the relation a & T is valid in general. Notice in Fig. 8-12 that the line\nof action of the force FD passes through the hinge, and hence its lever arm is zero.\nConsequently, zero torque is associated with FD and it gives rise to no angular\nacceleration, in accord with everyday experience (you can't get a door to start\nmoving by pushing directly at the hinge).\nIn general, then, we can write the magnitude of the torque about a given axis as\nT = r_F,\n(8-10a)\nwhere r is the lever arm, and the perpendicular symbol (1) reminds us that we\nmust use the distance from the axis of rotation that is perpendicular to the line of\naction of the force (Fig. 8-13a).\nAxis of\nrotation\nr\nPoint of\napplication\nof force\nB\nθ\nAn equivalent way of determining the torque associated with a force is to\nresolve the force into components parallel and perpendicular to the line that con-\nnects the axis to the point of application of the force, as shown in Fig. 8-13b.

[Note that 0 is the angle between the directions of F and r (radial\nline from the axis to the point where F acts).] We can use any of Eqs. 8-10 to\ncalculate the torque, whichever is easiest.\nBecause torque is a distance times a force, it is measured in units of m .

Force FB is applied perpendicularly at the mid-\npoint. Which force exerts the greater torque: FA , FB, or both the same?\nWhen more than one torque acts on an object, the angular acceleration « is\nfound to be proportional to the net torque. If all the torques acting on an object\ntend to rotate it in the same direction about a fixed axis of rotation, the net\ntorque is the sum of the torques. But if, say, one torque acts to rotate an object\nin one direction, and a second torque acts to rotate the object in the opposite\ndirection, the net torque is the difference of the two torques. We normally assign\na positive sign to torques that act to rotate the object counterclockwise (just as\n0 is usually positive counterclockwise), and a negative sign to torques that act\nto rotate the object clockwise.\n*\nForces that Act to Tilt the Axis\nWe have been considering only rotation about a fixed axis, and so we considered only\nforces that act in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. If there is a force\n(or component of a force) acting parallel to the axis of rotation, it will tend to tilt\nthe axis of rotation-the component F in Fig. 8-16 is an example. Since we are\nassuming the axis remains fixed in direction, either there can be no such forces\nor else the axis must be mounted in bearings or hinges that hold the axis fixed.\nThus, only a force, or component of a force (F1 in Fig. 8-16), in a plane perpen-\ndicular to the axis will give rise to rotational acceleration about the axis.\n8-5 Rotational Dynamics;\nTorque and Rotational Inertia\nWe discussed in Section 8-4 that the angular acceleration « of a rotating object is\nproportional to the net torque T applied to it:\nα α Στ.\nWe write ET to remind us that it is the net torque (sum of all torques acting on\nthe object) that is proportional to a. This corresponds to Newton's second law\nfor translational motion, a o EF. In the translational case, the acceleration is\nnot only proportional to the net force, but it is also inversely proportional to the\ninertia of the object, which we call its mass, m. Thus we wrote a = >F/m. But\nwhat plays the role of mass for the rotational case? That is what we now set out\nto determine. At the same time, we will see that the relation a x ET follows\ndirectly from Newton's second law, ¿F = ma.\nWe first examine a very simple case: a particle of mass m revolving in a circle\nof radius r at the end of a string or rod whose mass we can ignore compared to m\n(Fig. 8-17). Consider a force F that acts on the mass m tangent to the circle as shown.\nThe torque that gives rise to an angular acceleration is T = rF. If we use Newton's\nsecond law for linear quantities, >F = ma, and Eq. 8-5 relating the angular\nacceleration to the tangential linear acceleration, atan = ra, then we have\n1\nB\nF = ma\n= mra.\nm\n1\nWhen we multiply both sides of this equation by r, we find that the torque\n/\nT = rF = r(mra),\n1\n1\n1\nor\nT = mr2a.\n[single particle] (8-11)\nHere at last we have a direct relation between the angular acceleration and the\napplied torque T. The quantity mr2 represents the rotational inertia of the particle\nand is called its moment of inertia.\n208 CHAPTER 8 Rotational Motion\n", 'chapter_title': '8-1 Angular Quantities'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Now let us consider a rotating rigid object, such as a wheel rotating about a\nfixed axis (an axle) through its center. We can think of the wheel as consist-\ning of many particles located at various distances from the axis of rotation.\nWe can apply Eq. 8-11 to each particle of the object, and then sum over all the\nparticles. The sum of the various torques is the net torque, ET, so we obtain:\nΣτ = (Σmr2)α\n(8-12)\nwhere we factored out a because it is the same for all the particles of a rigid\nobject. The sum Emr2 represents the sum of the masses of each particle in the\nobject multiplied by the square of the distance of that particle from the axis\nof rotation. If we assign each particle a number (1, 2, 3, ... ), then ≥mr2 =\nm1r2 + m2r2 + m3r3 + .... This sum is called the moment of inertia (or rotational\ninertia) I of the object:\nI = Emr2 = mr2 + m2r2 + ....\n(8-13)\nCombining Eqs. 8-12 and 8-13, we can write\n¿T = Ia.\n(8-14)\nThis is the rotational equivalent of Newton\'s second law. It is valid for the rota-\ntion of a rigid object about a fixed axis. [It is also valid when the object is rotating\nwhile translating with acceleration, as long as I and a are calculated about the\ncenter of mass of the object, and the rotation axis through the CM doesn\'t change\ndirection. A ball rolling down a ramp is an example.]\nWe see that the moment of inertia, I, which is a measure of the rotational\ninertia of an object, plays the same role for rotational motion that mass does for\ntranslational motion. As can be seen from Eq. 8-13, the rotational inertia of a\nrigid object depends not only on its mass, but also on how that mass is distributed\nwith respect to the axis. For example, a large-diameter cylinder will have greater\nrotational inertia than one of equal mass but smaller diameter, Fig. 8-18. The\nformer will be harder to start rotating, and harder to stop. When the mass is\nconcentrated farther from the axis of rotation, the rotational inertia is greater. For\nrotational motion, the mass of an object can not be considered as concentrated\nat its center of mass.\nEXAMPLE 8-9\nTwo weights on a bar: different axis, different I. Two\nsmall "weights," of mass 5.0 kg and 7.0 kg, are mounted 4.0 m apart on a light\nrod (whose mass can be ignored), as shown in Fig. 8-19. Calculate the moment\nof inertia of the system (a) when rotated about an axis halfway between the\nweights, Fig. 8-19a, and (b) when rotated about an axis 0.50 m to the left of the\n5.0-kg mass (Fig. 8-19b).\nAPPROACH In each case, the moment of inertia of the system is found by\nsumming over the two parts using Eq. 8-13.\nSOLUTION (a) Both weights are the same distance, 2.0 m, from the axis of rota-\ntion. Thus\nI = Emr2 = (5.0kg)(2.0m)2 + (7.0kg)(2.0m)2\n= 20 kg · m2 + 28 kg · m2 = 48 kg · m2.\n(b) The 5.0-kg mass is now 0.50 m from the axis, and the 7.0-kg mass is 4.50 m\nfrom the axis.

First, the moment of\ninertia of a given system is different for different axes of rotation.

They do not contribute to the torque (their lever\narms are zero) and so we omit them to keep our diagram simple.\n4. Determine the torques. The cord exerts a force FT that acts at the edge of the\npulley, so its lever arm is R. The torque exerted by the cord equals RFT and\nis counterclockwise, which we choose to be positive.

This makes sense, though, because a pulley is not usually a uniform\ncylinder but instead has more of its mass concentrated toward the outside\nedge. Such a pulley would be expected to have a greater moment of inertia\nthan a solid cylinder of equal mass.

We assume the cord has negligible mass and does not stretch or slip\non the pulley. Calculate the angular acceleration a of the pulley and the linear accel-\neration a of the bucket. Assume the same frictional torque Tfr = 1.10 m . N acts.\nAPPROACH This situation looks a lot like Example 8-10, Fig. 8-21. But there is\na big difference: the tension in the cord is now an unknown, and it is no longer\nequal to the weight of the bucket if the bucket accelerates. Our system has two\nparts: the bucket, which can undergo translational motion (Fig. 8-22b is its free-\nbody diagram); and the pulley. The pulley does not translate, but it can rotate.\nWe apply the rotational version of Newton's second law to the pulley, ¿T = Ia,\nand the linear version to the bucket, ¿F = ma.\nSOLUTION Let FT be the tension in the cord. Then a force Fr acts at the edge of the\npulley, and we apply Newton's second law, Eq. 8-14, for the rotation of the pulley:\nΙα = Στ = RFT - Tfr .\n[pulley]\nNext we look at the (linear) motion of the bucket of mass m. Figure 8-22b, the\nfree-body diagram for the bucket, shows that two forces act on the bucket:\nthe force of gravity mg acts downward, and the tension of the cord Fr pulls\nupward. Applying Newton's second law, 2F = ma, for the bucket, we have\n(taking downward as positive):\nmg - FT = ma.\n[bucket]\nNote that the tension FT, which is the force exerted on the edge of the pulley, is\nnot equal to the weight of the bucket (= mg = 15.0N). There must be a net\nforce on the bucket if it is accelerating, so Fr < mg. We can also see this from\nthe last equation above, Fr = mg - ma.\nTo obtain a, we note that the tangential acceleration of a point on the\nedge of the pulley is the same as the acceleration of the bucket if the cord\ndoesn't stretch or slip. Hence we can use Eq. 8-5, atan = a = Ra. Substituting\nFr = mg - ma = mg - mRa into the first equation above (Newton's second\nlaw for rotation of the pulley), we obtain\nΙα = Στ = RFT - Tfr = R(mg - mRa) - Tfr = mgR - mR-a - Tfr.\nThe unknown a appears on the left and in the second term on the far right, so we\nbring that term to the left side and solve for a:\na =\nmgR - Tfr\nI + mR2\nThe numerator (mgR - Tfr) is the net torque, and the denominator (I + mR2)\nis the total rotational inertia of the system.

Because FT (= mg - ma = 15.0N - ma) is less than the\n15.0-N force in Example 8-10.

An object rotating about an axis is said to have rotational kinetic energy.\nBy analogy with translational kinetic energy, we might expect this to be given\nby the expression 2 I@2, where I is the moment of inertia of the object and @ is\nits angular velocity. We can indeed show that this is true.\n212 CHAPTER 8\n", 'chapter_title': '8-1 Angular Quantities'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Consider any rigid rotating object as made up of many tiny particles, each of\nmass m.

Several objects roll with-\nout slipping down an incline of vertical height H, all starting from rest at the\nsame moment. The objects are a thin hoop (or a plain wedding band), a spherical\nmarble, a solid cylinder (a D-cell battery), and an empty soup can. In addition,\na greased box slides down without friction. In what order do they reach the\nbottom of the incline?\nRESPONSE We use conservation of energy with gravitational potential energy\nplus rotational and translational kinetic energy. The sliding box would be fastest\nbecause the potential energy loss (MgH) is transformed completely into transla-\ntional kinetic energy of the box, whereas for rolling objects the initial potential\nenergy is shared between translational and rotational kinetic energies, and so the\nspeed of the CM is less. For each of the rolling objects we can state that the decrease in\npotential energy equals the increase in translational plus rotational kinetic energy:\nMgH = 2Mv2 + 21CM @2.\nFor all our rolling objects, the moment of inertia ICM is a numerical factor times\nthe mass M and the radius R2 (Fig. 8-20). The mass M is in each term, so the\ntranslational speed v doesn't depend on M; nor does it depend on the radius R\nsince @ = v/R, so R2 cancels out for all the rolling objects. Thus the speed v at\nthe bottom of the incline depends only on that numerical factor in IM which\nexpresses how the mass is distributed. The hoop, with all its mass concentrated\nat radius R (ICM = MR2), has the largest moment of inertia; hence it will have\nthe lowest speed and will arrive at the bottom behind the D-cell (ICM = {MR2),\nwhich in turn will be behind the marble (ICM = 3 MR2). The empty can, which is\nmainly a hoop plus a thin disk, has most of its mass concentrated at R; so it will\nbe a bit faster than the pure hoop but slower than the D-cell. See Fig. 8-24.\nNOTE The rolling objects do not even have to have the same radius: the speed\nat the bottom does not depend on the object's mass M or radius R, but only\non the shape (and the height of the incline H).\nIf there had been little or no static friction between the rolling objects and the\nplane in these Examples, the round objects would have slid rather than rolled, or a\ncombination of both. Static friction must be present to make a round object roll.\nWe did not need to take friction into account in the energy equation for the rolling\nobjects because it is static friction and does no work-the point of contact of a\nsphere at each instant does not slide, but moves perpendicular to the plane (first\ndown and then up as shown in Fig. 8-25) as it rolls. Thus, no work is done by the\nstatic friction force because the force and the motion (displacement) are perpen-\ndicular. The reason the rolling objects in Examples 8-12 and 8-13 move down the\nslope more slowly than if they were sliding is not because friction slows them\ndown. Rather, it is because some of the gravitional potential energy is converted\nto rotational kinetic energy, leaving less for the translational kinetic energy.\n-\nEXERCISE C Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 198, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nWork Done by Torque\nThe work done on an object rotating about a fixed axis, such as the pulleys in\nFigs. 8-21 and 8-22, can be written using angular quantities. As shown in\nFig. 8-26, a force F exerting a torque T = rF on a wheel does work W = F Al\nin rotating the wheel a small distance Al at the point of application of F. The\nwheel has rotated through a small angle 40 = 4l/r (Eq. 8-1). Hence\nW = F Al = Fr A0.\nBecause T = rF, then\nW = TAO\n(8-17)\nis the work done by the torque T when rotating the wheel through an angle A0.\nFinally, power P is the rate work is done:\nP = W/At = τ Δθ/Δt = τω,\nwhich is analogous to the translational version, P = Fv (see Eq. 6-18).\n214 CHAPTER 8\n", 'chapter_title': '8-1 Angular Quantities'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': "8-8 Angular Momentum and\nIts Conservation\nThroughout this Chapter we have seen that if we use the appropriate angular\nvariables, the kinematic and dynamic equations for rotational motion are anal-\nogous to those for ordinary linear motion. We saw in the previous Section,\nfor example, that rotational kinetic energy can be written as ¿ I@2, which is\nanalogous to the translational kinetic energy, ¿ mv2. In like manner, the linear\nmomentum, p = mv, has a rotational analog. It is called angular momentum, L.\nFor a symmetrical object rotating about a fixed axis through the CM, the angular\nmomentum is\nL = Iw,\n(8-18)\nwhere I is the moment of inertia and @ is the angular velocity about the axis of\nrotation. The SI units for L are kg · m2/s, which has no special name.\nWe saw in Chapter 7 (Section 7-1) that Newton's second law can be written\nnot only as >F = ma but also more generally in terms of momentum (Eq. 7-2),\n>F = Ap/At. In a similar way, the rotational equivalent of Newton's second\nlaw, which we saw in Eq. 8-14 can be written as 2T = Ia, can also be written in\nterms of angular momentum:\nET = AL ,\nAt\n(8-19)\nNEWTON'S SECOND LAW\nFOR ROTATION\nwhere ET is the net torque acting to rotate the object, and AL is the change in\nangular momentum in a time interval At. Equation 8-14, ¿T = Ia, is a special\ncase of Eq. 8-19 when the moment of inertia is constant. This can be seen as\nfollows. If an object has angular velocity @0 at time t = 0, and angular velocity @\nafter a time interval At, then its angular acceleration (Eq. 8-3) is\na = A0 -\n3\nAt\nAt\n.\nThen from Eq. 8-19, we have\nAt\nΣτ = AL _Ιω - Ιωο\n=\nI(@ - @0)\n=\n△t\nAt\nI\nAt\n=\nIa,\nwhich is Eq. 8-14.\nAngular momentum is an important concept in physics because, under\ncertain conditions, it is a conserved quantity. We can see from Eq. 8-19 that if\nthe net torque ET on an object is zero, then AL/ At equals zero. That is, AL = 0,\nso L does not change. This is the law of conservation of angular momentum for\na rotating object:\nThe total angular momentum of a rotating object remains constant if the net\ntorque acting on it is zero.\nCONSERVATION OF\nANGULAR MOMENTUM\nThe law of conservation of angular momentum is one of the great conservation\nlaws of physics, along with those for energy and linear momentum.\nWhen there is zero net torque acting on an object, and the object is rotating\nabout a fixed axis or about an axis through its center of mass whose direction\ndoesn't change, we can write\nI = Low0 = constant.\n(8-20)\nIo and wo are the moment of inertia and angular velocity, respectively, about that\naxis at some initial time (t = 0), and I and @ are their values at some other time.\nThe parts of the object may alter their positions relative to one another, so that I\nchanges. But then @ changes as well, so that the product Io remains constant.\nSECTION 8-8 Angular Momentum and Its Conservation 215\n", 'chapter_title': '8-1 Angular Quantities'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': "I large,\n@ small\nI small,\n@ large\nW\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 8-27 A skater spinning on\nice, illustrating conservation of angular\nmomentum: (a) I is large and @ is\nsmall; (b) I is smaller so @ is larger.\nFIGURE 8-28 A diver rotates faster\nwhen arms and legs are tucked in\nthan when they are outstretched.\nAngular momentum is conserved.\nFIGURE 8-29 Example 8-14.\nMB\nMA\nMany interesting phenomena can be understood on the basis of conservation\nof angular momentum. Consider a skater doing a spin on the tips of her skates,\nFig. 8-27. She rotates at a relatively low speed when her arms are outstretched;\nwhen she brings her arms in close to her body, she suddenly spins much faster.\nFrom the definition of moment of inertia, I = Emr2, it is clear that when she\npulls her arms in closer to the axis of rotation, r is reduced for the arms so her\nmoment of inertia is reduced. Since the angular momentum I@ remains constant\n(we ignore the small torque due to friction), if I decreases, then the angular\nvelocity @ must increase. If the skater reduces her moment of inertia by a factor\nof 2, she will then rotate with twice the angular velocity.\nEXERCISE D When a spinning figure skater pulls in her arms, her moment of inertia\ndecreases; to conserve angular momentum, her angular velocity increases. Does her\nrotational kinetic energy also increase? If so, where does the energy come from?\nA similar example is the diver shown in Fig. 8-28. The push as she leaves the\nboard gives her an initial angular momentum about her center of mass. When\nshe curls herself into the tuck position, she rotates quickly one or more times. She\nthen stretches out again, increasing her moment of inertia which reduces the\nangular velocity to a small value, and then she enters the water. The change in\nmoment of inertia from the straight position to the tuck position can be a factor\nof as much as 32.\nNote that for angular momentum to be conserved, the net torque must be\nzero; but the net force does not necessarily have to be zero. The net force on the\ndiver in Fig. 8-28, for example, is not zero (gravity is acting), but the net torque\nabout her CM is zero because the force of gravity acts at her center of mass.\nEXAMPLE 8-14\nClutch.

But they have a vector aspect too, and now we consider the\ndirections. In fact, we have to define the directions for rotational quantities. We\nconsider first the angular velocity, d.\nConsider the rotating wheel shown in Fig. 8-30a. The linear velocities of\ndifferent particles of the wheel point in all different directions. The only unique\ndirection in space associated with the rotation is along the axis of rotation, perpen-\ndicular to the actual motion. We therefore choose the axis of rotation to be the\ndirection of the angular velocity vector, @. Actually, there is still an ambiguity\nsince @ could point in either direction along the axis of rotation (up or down\nin Fig. 8-30a). The convention we use, called the right-hand rule, is this: when\nthe fingers of the right hand are curled around the rotation axis and point in the\ndirection of the rotation, then the thumb points in the direction of d. This is\nshown in Fig. 8-30b. Note that @ points in the direction a right-handed screw\nwould move when turned in the direction of rotation. Thus, if the rotation of the\nwheel in Fig. 8-30a is counterclockwise, the direction of @ is upward as shown in\nFig. 8-30b. If the wheel rotates clockwise, then @ points in the opposite direction,\ndownward. Note that no part of the rotating object moves in the direction of @.\nIf the axis of rotation is fixed, then @ can change only in magnitude. Thus\n& = Ad/At must also point along the axis of rotation. If the rotation is counter-\nclockwise as in Fig. 8-30a and the magnitude of @ is increasing, then & points\nupward; but if @ is decreasing (the wheel is slowing down), & points downward.\nIf the rotation is clockwise, & points downward if @ is increasing, and & points\nupward if @ is decreasing.\n13\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 8-30 (a) Rotating wheel.\n(b) Right-hand rule for obtaining the\ndirection of @.\n*SECTION 8-9 Vector Nature of Angular Quantities 217\n', 'chapter_title': '8-1 Angular Quantities'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': "13\nAngular momentum, like linear momentum, is a vector quantity.

For example, consider a\nperson standing at rest on a circular platform capable of rotating without fric-\ntion about an axis through its center (that is, a simplified merry-go-round). If\nthe person now starts to walk along the edge of the platform, Fig. 8-31a, the\nplatform starts rotating in the opposite direction. Why? One explanation is that\nthe person's foot exerts a force on the platform. Another explanation (and this\nis the most useful analysis here) is that this is an example of the conservation of\nangular momentum. If the person starts walking counterclockwise, the person's\nangular momentum will point upward along the axis of rotation (remember\nhow we defined the direction of @ using the right-hand rule). The magnitude of\nthe person's angular momentum will be L = Io = (mr2)(v/r), where v is the\nperson's speed (relative to the Earth, not to the platform), r is his distance from\nthe rotation axis, m is his mass, and mr2 is his moment of inertia if we consider\nhim a particle (mass concentrated at one point, Eq. 8-11). The platform rotates in the\nopposite direction, so its angular momentum points downward. If the total\nangular momentum of the system is initially zero (person and platform at rest),\nit will remain zero after the person starts walking. That is, the upward angular\nmomentum of the person just balances the oppositely directed downward\nangular momentum of the platform (Fig. 8-31b), so the total vector angular\nmomentum remains zero. Even though the person exerts a force (and torque)\non the platform, the platform exerts an equal and opposite torque on the person.\nSo the net torque on the system of person plus platform is zero (ignoring\nfriction), and the total angular momentum remains constant.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 8-16\nSpinning bicycle wheel.

That is also what\nthe system's angular momentum must be afterward, since L is conserved\nwhen there is no net torque. Thus, if the wheel's angular momentum after being\nflipped over is -L downward, then the angular momentum of teacher plus\nturntable will have to be +2L upward.
