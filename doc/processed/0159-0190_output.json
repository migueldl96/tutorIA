In that analysis, force has played\na central role as the quantity determining the motion. In this Chapter\nand the next, we discuss an alternative analysis of the translational motion of\nobjects in terms of the quantities energy and momentum. The significance of\nenergy and momentum is that they are conserved. That is, in quite general cir-\ncumstances they remain constant. That conserved quantities exist gives us not only\na deeper insight into the nature of the world, but also gives us another way to\napproach solving practical problems.\nU\nThe conservation laws of energy and momentum are especially valuable in\ndealing with systems of many objects, in which a detailed consideration of the\nforces involved would be difficult or impossible. These laws apply to a wide\nrange of phenomena. They even apply in the atomic and subatomic worlds, where\nNewton's laws are not sufficient.\nThis Chapter is devoted to the very important concept of energy and the\nclosely related concept of work.

The\nwork done by the force F is\nW = Fd cos 0, where d is the\ndisplacement.\nB\nd\n6-1 Work Done by a Constant Force\nThe word work has a variety of meanings in everyday language. But in physics,\nwork is given a very specific meaning to describe what is accomplished when a\nforce acts on an object, and the object moves through a distance. We consider\nonly translational motion for now and, unless otherwise explained, objects are\nassumed to be rigid with no complicating internal motion, and can be treated like\nparticles. Then the work done on an object by a constant force (constant in both\nmagnitude and direction) is defined to be the product of the magnitude of the\ndisplacement times the component of the force parallel to the displacement. In\nequation form, we can write\nW = Fd,\nwhere F is the component of the constant force F parallel to the displacement d.\nWe can also write\nW = Fd cos 0,\n(6-1)\nwhere F is the magnitude of the constant force, d is the magnitude of the displace-\nment of the object, and 0 is the angle between the directions of the force and the\ndisplacement (Fig. 6-1). The cos 0 factor appears in Eq. 6-1 because F cos 0\n(= F1) is the component of F that is parallel to d. Work is a scalar quantity-it\nhas no direction, but only magnitude, which can be positive or negative.\nLet us consider the case in which the motion and the force are in the same\ndirection, so 0 = 0 and cos 0 = 1; in this case, W = Fd. For example, if you\npush a loaded grocery cart a distance of 50 m by exerting a horizontal force of\n30 N on the cart, you do 30 N X 50 m = 1500 N .m of work on the cart.\nAs this example shows, in SI units work is measured in newton-meters\n(N ·m). A special name is given to this unit, the joule (J): 1 J = 1 N ·m.\n[In the cgs system, the unit of work is called the erg and is defined as\n1 erg = 1 dyne . cm. In British units, work is measured in foot-pounds. Their\nequivalence is 1 J = 107 erg = 0.7376 ft · lb.]\nA force can be exerted on an object and yet do no work. If you hold a heavy\nbag of groceries in your hands at rest, you do no work on it. You do exert a force\non the bag, but the displacement of the bag is zero, so the work done by you on\nthe bag is W = 0. You need both a force and a displacement to do work. You\nalso do no work on the bag of groceries if you carry it as you walk horizontally\nacross the floor at constant velocity, as shown in Fig. 6-2. No horizontal force is\nrequired to move the bag at a constant velocity. The person shown in Fig. 6-2\nexerts an upward force Fp on the bag equal to its weight. But this upward\nforce is perpendicular to the horizontal displacement of the bag and thus is doing\nno work. This conclusion comes from our definition of work, Eq. 6-1: W = 0,\nbecause 0 = 90° and cos 90° = 0. Thus, when a particular force is perpendicu-\nlar to the displacement, no work is done by that force. When you start or stop\nwalking, there is a horizontal acceleration and you do briefly exert a horizontal\nforce, and thus do work on the bag.\nFIGURE 6-2 The person does no\nwork on the bag of groceries because\nFp is perpendicular to the\ndisplacement d.\nB\nB\nd\nmỹ\nCAUTION\nForce without work\nSECTION 6-1 Work Done by a Constant Force 139\n', 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CAUTION\nState that work is done\non or by an object\nWhen we deal with work, as with force, it is necessary to specify whether you\nare talking about work done by a specific object or done on a specific object. It is\nalso important to specify whether the work done is due to one particular force (and\nwhich one), or the total (net) work done by the net force on the object.\ny\nFIGURE 6-3 Example 6-1.\nA 50-kg crate is pulled\nalong a floor.\nS\nS\nF\nN\n> X\nFP\n0 = 37°\nx (40 m)\nmg\nEXAMPLE 6-1\nWork done on a crate. A person pulls a 50-kg crate 40 m\nalong a horizontal floor by a constant force Fp = 100 N, which acts at a 37° angle\nas shown in Fig. 6-3. The floor is rough and exerts a friction force Ffr = 50 N.\nDetermine (a) the work done by each force acting on the crate, and (b) the net\nwork done on the crate.\nAPPROACH We choose our coordinate system so that the vector that repre-\nsents the 40-m displacement is x (that is, along the x axis). Four forces act on\nthe crate, as shown in the free-body diagram in Fig. 6-3: the force exerted by\nthe person Fp; the friction force Ffr; the gravitational force exerted by the\nEarth, FG = mg; and the normal force FN exerted upward by the floor. The net\nforce on the crate is the vector sum of these four forces.\nSOLUTION (a) The work done by the gravitational force (FG) and by the\nnormal force (FN) is zero, because they are perpendicular to the displacement x\n(0 = 90° in Eq. 6-1):\nWG = mgx cos 90° = 0\nWN = FNx cos 90° = 0.\nThe work done by Fp is\nWp= Fpxcos0 = (100N)(40 m) cos 37° = 3200 J.\nThe work done by the friction force is\nWfr = Ffrx cos 180° = (50N)(40 m)(-1) = - 2000 J.\nThe angle between the displacement x and Ffr is 180° because they point in\nopposite directions. Since the force of friction is opposing the motion (and\ncos 180° = - 1), the work done by friction on the crate is negative.\n(b) The net work can be calculated in two equivalent ways.\n(1) The net work done on an object is the algebraic sum of the work done by each\nforce, since work is a scalar:\nWnet = WG + WN + Wp + Wfr\n= 0 + 0 + 3200 J - 2000 J = 1200 J.\n(2) The net work can also be calculated by first determining the net force on the\nobject and then taking the component of this net force along the displacement:\n(Fnet)x = Fp cos 0 - Ffr. Then the net work is\nWnet = (Fnet)xx = (Fp cos 0 - Ffr) x\n= (100 N cos 37° - 50 N)(40 m) = 1200 J.\nIn the vertical (y) direction, there is no displacement and no work done.\nCAUTION\nNegative work\nIn Example 6-1 we saw that friction did negative work. In general, the work\ndone by a force is negative whenever the force (or the component of the force, Fy)\nacts in the direction opposite to the direction of motion.\nEXERCISE A A box is dragged a distance d across a floor by a force Fp which makes an\nangle 0 with the horizontal as in Fig. 6-1 or 6-3. If the magnitude of Fp is held constant\nbut the angle 0 is increased, the work done by Fp (a) remains the same; (b) increases;\n(c) decreases; (d) first increases, then decreases.\n140 CHAPTER 6\n', 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': "S\nLVING\nWork\n`PROBLEM\n1. Draw a free-body diagram showing all the forces act-\ning on the object you choose to study.\n2. Choose an xy coordinate system. If the object is in\nmotion, it may be convenient to choose one of the\ncoordinate directions as the direction of one of the\nforces, or as the direction of motion. [Thus, for an\nobject on an incline, you might choose one coordinate\naxis to be parallel to the incline.]\n3. Apply Newton's laws to determine unknown forces.\n4. Find the work done by a specific force on the object by\nusing W = Fd cos 0 for a constant force. The work\ndone is negative when a force opposes the displacement.\n5.

(a) Determine the work a hiker must\ndo on a 15.0-kg backpack to carry it up a hill of height h = 10.0 m, as shown in\nFig. 6-4a. Determine also (b) the work done by gravity on the backpack, and\n(c) the net work done on the backpack. For simplicity, assume the motion is\nsmooth and at constant velocity (i.e., acceleration is zero).\nAPPROACH We explicitly follow the steps of the Problem Solving Strategy above.\nSOLUTION\n1. Draw a free-body diagram. The forces on the backpack are shown in Fig. 6-4b:\nthe force of gravity, mg, acting downward; and FH, the force the hiker must\nexert upward to support the backpack. The acceleration is zero, so horizontal\nforces on the backpack are negligible.\n2. Choose a coordinate system. We are interested in the vertical motion of the\nbackpack, so we choose the y coordinate as positive vertically upward.\n3. Apply Newton's laws. Newton's second law applied in the vertical direction\nto the backpack gives (with ay = 0)\n≥Fy = may\nFH - mg = 0.\nSo,\nFH = mg = (15.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 147 N.\n4. Work done by a specific force. (a) To calculate the work done by the hiker on\nthe backpack, we use Eq. 6-1, where 0 is shown in Fig. 6-4c,\nWH = FH(d cos 0),\nand we note from Fig. 6-4a that d cos 0 = h. So the work done by the hiker is\nWH = FH(d cos 0) = FHh = mgh = (147 N)(10.0 m) = 1470 J.\nThe work done depends only on the elevation change and not on the angle of the\nhill, 0. The hiker would do the same work to lift the pack vertically by height h.\n(b) The work done by gravity on the backpack is (from Eq. 6-1 and Fig. 6-4c)\nWG = mg d cos(180° - 0).\nSince cos(180° - 0) = - cos 0 (Appendix A-7), we have\nWG = mg(-d cos 0)\n= - mgh\n= - (15.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2)(10.0 m) = - 1470 J.\nNOTE The work done by gravity (which is negative here) does not depend on the\nangle of the incline, only on the vertical height h of the hill.\n5. Net work done. (c) The net work done on the backpack is Wnet = 0, because the\nnet force on the backpack is zero (it is assumed not to accelerate significantly).\nWe can also get the net work done by adding the work done by each force:\nWnet = WG + WH = - 1470J + 1470J = 0.\nNOTE Even though the net work done by all the forces on the backpack is zero,\nthe hiker does do work on the backpack equal to 1470 J.\nFIGURE 6-4 Example 6-2.\nB\nθ\nh\n(a)\nFH\ny\n* X\nmg\n(b)\nFH\nB\nθ\n180° - 0\nθ\nmg\n(c)\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nWork done by gravity depends on\nheight of hill (not on angle)\nSECTION 6-1 141\n", 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'B\nMoon\nFG\n1\nEarth\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 6-3\nDoes the Earth do work on the Moon?\nThe Moon revolves around the Earth in a nearly circular orbit, kept there by the\ngravitational force exerted by the Earth.

The Moon\'s displacement at any moment is\ntangent to the circle, in the direction of its velocity, perpendicular to the radius and\nperpendicular to the force of gravity. Hence the angle 0 between the force FG\nand the instantaneous displacement of the Moon is 90°, and the work done by\ngravity is therefore zero (cos 90° = 0).

But in many cases, the force varies in magnitude or\ndirection during a process. For example, as a rocket moves away from Earth, work\nis done to overcome the force of gravity, which varies as the inverse square of\nthe distance from the Earth\'s center. Other examples are the force exerted by\na spring, which increases with the amount of stretch, or the work done by a vary-\ning force that pulls a box or cart up an uneven hill.\nThe work done by a varying force can be determined graphically. To do so,\nwe plot F (= F cos 0, the component of F parallel to the direction of motion\nat any point) as a function of distance d, as in Fig. 6-6a. We divide the distance\ninto small segments Ad. For each segment, we indicate the average of Fy by a\nhorizontal dashed line. Then the work done for each segment is AW = F Ad,\nwhich is the area of a rectangle Ad wide and F high. The total work done to\nmove the object a total distance d = dB - da is the sum of the areas of the\nrectangles (five in the case shown in Fig. 6-6a). Usually, the average value of F\nfor each segment must be estimated, and a reasonable approximation of the work\ndone can then be made.\nIf we subdivide the distance into many more segments, Ad can be made smaller\nand our estimate of the work done would be more accurate. In the limit as Ad\napproaches zero, the total area of the many narrow rectangles approaches the\narea under the curve, Fig. 6-6b. That is, the work done by a variable force in\nmoving an object between two points is equal to the area under the Fy vs. d curve\nbetween those two points.\ndB\n6-3 Kinetic Energy, and\nthe Work-Energy Principle\nEnergy is one of the most important concepts in science. Yet we cannot give a\nsimple general definition of energy in only a few words. Nonetheless, each specific\ntype of energy can be defined fairly simply. In this Chapter we define translational\nkinetic energy and some types of potential energy. In later Chapters, we will examine\nother types of energy, such as that related to heat and electricity. The crucial\naspect of energy is that the sum of all types, the total energy, is the same after\nany process as it was before: that is, energy is a conserved quantity.\nFor the purposes of this Chapter, we can define energy in the traditional way\nas "the ability to do work." This simple definition is not always applicable,+ but it\nis valid for mechanical energy which we discuss in this Chapter. We now define\nand discuss one of the basic types of energy, kinetic energy.\n* Energy associated with heat is often not available to do work, as we will discuss in Chapter 15.\n142 CHAPTER 6 Work and Energy\n', 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'A moving object can do work on another object it strikes. A flying cannonball\ndoes work on a brick wall it knocks down; a moving hammer does work on a nail\nit drives into wood. In either case, a moving object exerts a force on a second\nobject which undergoes a displacement. An object in motion has the ability to\ndo work and thus can be said to have energy. The energy of motion is called\nkinetic energy, from the Greek word kinetikos, meaning "motion."\nB\nv\n1\nB\nnet\nV2\nB\nB\nd\n*\nnet\nTo obtain a quantitative definition for kinetic energy, let us consider a simple\nrigid object of mass m (treated as a particle) that is moving in a straight line with an\ninitial speed v1 . To accelerate it uniformly to a speed 02, a constant net force Fnet\nis exerted on it parallel to its motion over a displacement d, Fig. 6-7. Then the net\nwork done on the object is Wnet = Fnet d. We apply Newton\'s second law, Fnet = ma,\nand use Eq. 2-11c (v)} = 0} + 2ad), which we rewrite as\na =\n03 - 0주\n2d\nwhere 01 is the initial speed and 02 is the final speed.

Equation 6-2, derived here for one-\ndimensional motion with a constant force, is valid in general for translational\nmotion of an object in three dimensions and even if the force varies.\nWe can rewrite Eq. 6-2 as:\nWnet = KE2 - KE1\nor\nWnet = AKE = }mvz - ¿ mv2.\n(6-4)\nEquation 6-4 is a useful result known as the work-energy principle. It can be\nstated in words:\nThe net work done on an object is equal to the change in the object\'s\nkinetic energy.\nNotice that we made use of Newton\'s second law, Fnet = ma, where Fnet is the net\nforce-the sum of all forces acting on the object. Thus, the work-energy principle\nis valid only if W is the net work done on the object-that is, the work done by\nall forces acting on the object.\nFIGURE 6-7 A constant net\nforce Fnet accelerates a car from\nspeed v1 to speed 22 over a\ndisplacement d.

The\nhammer exerts a force F on the\nnail; the nail exerts a force - F on\nthe hammer (Newton's third law).\nThe work done on the nail by the\nhammer is positive (Wn = Fd > 0).\nThe work done on the hammer by\nthe nail is negative (Wh = - Fd).\nThe work-energy principle is a very useful reformulation of Newton's laws.\nIt tells us that if (positive) net work W is done on an object, the object's kinetic\nenergy increases by an amount W. The principle also holds true for the reverse\nsituation: if the net work W done on an object is negative, the object's kinetic\nenergy decreases by an amount W. That is, a net force exerted on an object oppo-\nsite to the object's direction of motion decreases its speed and its kinetic energy.\nAn example is a moving hammer (Fig. 6-8) striking a nail. The net force on the\nhammer (-F in Fig. 6-8, where F is assumed constant for simplicity) acts toward\nthe left, whereas the displacement d of the hammer is toward the right. So the net\nwork done on the hammer, Wh = (F)(d)(cos 180°) = - Fd, is negative and the\nhammer's kinetic energy decreases (usually to zero).\nFigure 6-8 also illustrates how energy can be considered the ability to\ndo work. The hammer, as it slows down, does positive work on the nail:\nWn=(+F)(+d) = Fd and is positive. The decrease in kinetic energy of the\nhammer (= Fd by Eq. 6-4) is equal to the work the hammer can do on another\nobject, the nail in this case.\nThe translational kinetic energy (= 2 mv2) is directly proportional to the mass\nof the object, and it is also proportional to the square of the speed. Thus, if the\nmass is doubled, the kinetic energy is doubled. But if the speed is doubled, the\nobject has four times as much kinetic energy and is therefore capable of doing four\ntimes as much work.\nBecause of the direct connection between work and kinetic energy, energy is\nmeasured in the same units as work: joules in SI units. [The energy unit is ergs in\nthe cgs, and foot-pounds in the British system.] Like work, kinetic energy is a\nscalar quantity. The kinetic energy of a group of objects is the sum of the kinetic\nenergies of the individual objects.\nThe work-energy principle can be applied to a particle, and also to an object\nthat can be approximated as a particle, such as an object that is rigid or whose\ninternal motions are insignificant. It is very useful in simple situations, as we will\nsee in the Examples below.\nV1 = 20 m/s\nV2 = 30 m/s\nFIGURE 6-9 Example 6-4.\nEXAMPLE 6-4 |ESTIMATE\nWork on a car, to increase its kinetic energy.\nHow much net work is required to accelerate a 1000-kg car from 20 m/s to\n30 m/s (Fig. 6-9)?\nAPPROACH A car is a complex system. The engine turns the wheels and tires\nwhich push against the ground, and the ground pushes back (see Example 4-4).\nWe aren't interested right now in those complications.

But it is also possible to have potential energy, which is\nthe energy associated with forces that depend on the position or configuration of an\nobject (or objects) relative to the surroundings. Various types of potential energy\n(PE) can be defined, and each type is associated with a particular force.\nThe spring of a wind-up toy is an example of an object with potential energy.\nThe spring acquired its potential energy because work was done on it by the person\nwinding the toy. As the spring unwinds, it exerts a force and does work to make\nthe toy move.\nGravitational Potential Energy\nPerhaps the most common example of potential energy is gravitational potential\nenergy. A heavy brick held high above the ground has potential energy because\nof its position relative to the Earth. The raised brick has the ability to do work,\nfor if it is released, it will fall to the ground due to the gravitational force, and can\ndo work on, say, a stake, driving it into the ground.\nSECTION 6-4 Potential Energy\n145\n", 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Y2 ------\nB\nd\next\nB\n(exerted\nby hand)\nh\nm\ny\nVFG= mg\nFIGURE 6-11 A person exerts an\nupward force Fext = mg to lift a\nbrick from y1 to y2 .\nCAUTION\nChange in PE is what is\nphysically meaningful\nLet us seek the form for the gravitational potential energy of an object near\nthe surface of the Earth.

So\nWG = - mgh\n= - mg(y2 - y1).\n(6-5b)\nNext, if we allow the object to start from rest at y2 and fall freely under the\naction of gravity, it acquires a velocity given by v2 = 2gh (Eq.2-11c) after falling a\nheight h. It then has kinetic energy 2 mv2 = 2m(2gh) = mgh, and if it strikes a\nstake, it can do work on the stake equal to mgh (Section 6-3).\nThus, to raise an object of mass m to a height h requires an amount of work\nequal to mgh (Eq. 6-5a). And once at height h, the object has the ability to do an\namount of work equal to mgh. We can say that the work done in lifting the object\nhas been stored as gravitational potential energy.\nWe therefore define the gravitational potential energy of an object, due to\nEarth\'s gravity, as the product of the object\'s weight mg and its height y above\nsome reference level (such as the ground):\nPEG = mgy.\n(6-6)\nThe higher an object is above the ground, the more gravitational potential energy\nit has. We combine Eq. 6-5a with Eq. 6-6:\nWext = mg(y2 -y1)\nWext = PE2 - PE1 = APEG .\n(6-7a)\nThat is, the change in gravitational potential energy when an object is moved\nfrom height y1 to height y2 is equal to the work done by the net external force\nthat accomplishes this without acceleration.\nA more direct way to define the change in gravitational potential energy, APEG,\nis that it is equal to the negative of the work done by gravity itself (Eq. 6-5b):\nWG = - mg(y2 -y1)\nWG = - (PE2 - PE1) = - APEG\nor\nAPEG = - WG .\n(6-7b)\nGravitational potential energy depends on the vertical height of the object\nabove some reference level (Eq. 6-6). In some situations, you may wonder from\nwhat point to measure the height y. The gravitational potential energy of a book\nheld high above a table, for example, depends on whether we measure y from\nthe top of the table, from the floor, or from some other reference point. What\nis physically important in any situation is the change in potential energy, APE,\nbecause that is what is related to the work done, Eqs. 6-7; and it is APE that\ncan be measured. We can thus choose to measure y from any reference level\nthat is convenient, but we must choose the reference level at the start and be\nconsistent throughout. The change in potential energy between any two points\ndoes not depend on this choice.\n146 CHAPTER 6\n', 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': "An important result we discussed earlier (see Example 6-2 and Fig. 6-4)\nconcerns the gravity force, which does work only in the vertical direction: the\nwork done by gravity depends only on the vertical height h, and not on the path\ntaken, whether it be purely vertical motion or, say, motion along an incline. Thus,\nfrom Eqs. 6-7 we see that changes in gravitational potential energy depend only\non the change in vertical height and not on the path taken.\nPotential energy belongs to a system, and not to a single object alone. Poten-\ntial energy is associated with a force, and a force on one object is always exerted\nby some other object. Thus potential energy is a property of the system as a\nwhole. For an object raised to a height y above the Earth's surface, the change in\ngravitational potential energy is mgy. The system here is the object plus the\nEarth, and properties of both are involved: object (m) and Earth (g).\nCAUTION\nPotential energy belongs to a system,\nnot to a single object\nEXAMPLE 6-6\nPotential energy changes for a roller coaster. A 1000-kg\nroller-coaster car moves from point 1, Fig. 6-12, to point 2 and then to point 3.\n(a) What is the gravitational potential energy at points 2 and 3 relative to\npoint 1? That is, take y = 0 at point 1. (b) What is the change in potential\nenergy when the car goes from point 2 to point 3? (c) Repeat parts (a) and (b),\nbut take the reference point (y = 0) to be at point 3.\nAPPROACH We are interested in the potential energy of the car-Earth system.\nWe take upward as the positive y direction, and use the definition of gravitational\npotential energy to calculate the potential energy.\nSOLUTION (a) We measure heights from point 1 (y1 = 0), which means initially\nthat the gravitational potential energy is zero.

Therefore,\nPE3 = mgy3 = (1000 kg)(9.8 m/s2)(-15m) = - 1.5 × 105 J.\n(b) In going from point 2 to point 3, the potential energy change (PEfinal - PEinitial) is\nPE3 - PE2 = (-1.5× 105 J)-(9.8×104 J)= - 2.5×105 J.\nThe gravitational potential energy decreases by 2.5 × 105 J.\n(c) Now we set y3 = 0. Then y1 = +15 m at point 1, so the potential energy initially\nis\nPE1 = (1000 kg)(9.8 m/s2)(15 m) = 1.5 × 105 J.\nAt point 2, y2 = 25 m, so the potential energy is\nPE2 = 2.5 × 105 J.\nAt point 3, y3 = 0, so the potential energy is zero. The change in potential energy\ngoing from point 2 to point 3 is\nPE3 - PE2 = 0 - 2.5 × 105 J = - 2.5 × 105 J,\nwhich is the same as in part (b).\nNOTE Work done by gravity depends only on the vertical height, so changes in\ngravitational potential energy do not depend on the path taken.\nPotential Energy Defined in General\nThere are other kinds of potential energy besides gravitational. Each form of\npotential energy is associated with a particular force, and can be defined analo-\ngously to gravitational potential energy. In general, the change in potential energy\nassociated with a particular force is equal to the negative of the work done by\nthat force when the object is moved from one point to a second point (as in Eq. 6-7b\nfor gravity). An alternate and sometimes useful way to define the change in\npotential energy is: the work required of a net external force to move the object\nwithout acceleration between the two points, as in Eq. 6-7a.\nPotential Energy defined\nSECTION 6-4 Potential Energy\n147\n", 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 6-13 A spring (a) can store\nenergy (elastic PE) when compressed as in\n(b) and can do work when released (c).\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nx=0\n(a) Unstretched\n(b) Stretched\n1x\nB\nFs\next\n(c) Compressed\nx\nB\nB\nF\next\nS\nFIGURE 6-14 (a) Spring in natural\n(unstretched) position.

Consider the simple coil spring shown\nin Fig. 6-13. The spring has potential energy when compressed (or stretched),\nbecause when it is released, it can do work on a ball as shown. To hold a spring either\nstretched or compressed an amount x from its natural (unstretched) length requires\nthe hand to exert an external force on the spring of magnitude Fext which is\ndirectly proportional to x. That is,\nFext = kx,\nwhere k is a constant, called the spring stiffness constant (or simply spring constant),\nand is a measure of the stiffness of the particular spring. The stretched or compressed\nspring itself exerts a force Fs in the opposite direction on the hand, as shown in\nFig. 6-14:\nFs = - kx.\n[spring force] (6-8)\nThis force is sometimes called a "restoring force" because the spring exerts its\nforce in the direction opposite the displacement (hence the minus sign), acting to\nreturn it to its natural length. Equation 6-8 is known as the spring equation and\nalso as Hooke\'s law, and is accurate for springs as long as x is not too great.\nTo calculate the potential energy of a stretched spring, let us calculate the\nwork required to stretch it (Fig. 6-14b). We might hope to use Eq. 6-1 for the\nwork done on it, W = Fx, where x is the amount it is stretched from its natural\nlength. But this would be incorrect since the force Fext (= kx) is not constant but\nvaries over the distance x, becoming greater the more the spring is stretched, as\nshown graphically in Fig. 6-15. So let us use the average force, F. Since Fext varies\nlinearly, from zero at the unstretched position to kx when stretched to x, the\naverage force is F = {[0 + kx] = >kx, where x here is the final amount stretched\n(shown as xf in Fig. 6-15 for clarity). The work done is then\nWext = Fx = (kx) (x) = >kx2.\nHence the elastic potential energy, PEel , is proportional to the square of the amount\nstretched:\nPEel = kx2.\n[elastic spring] (6-9)\nIf a spring is compressed a distance x from its natural ("equilibrium") length, the\naverage force again has magnitude F = 2kx, and again the potential energy is\ngiven by Eq. 6-9. Thus x can be either the amount compressed or amount stretched\nfrom the spring\'s natural length.+ Note that for a spring, we choose the reference\npoint for zero PE at the spring\'s natural position.\nPotential Energy as Stored Energy\nIn the above examples of potential energy-from a brick held at a height y, to a\nstretched or compressed spring-an object has the capacity or potential to do work\neven though it is not yet actually doing it. These examples show that energy can be\nstored, for later use, in the form of potential energy (as in Fig. 6-13, for a spring).\nNote that there is a single universal formula for the translational kinetic energy\nof an object, 2 mv2, but there is no single formula for potential energy. Instead,\nthe mathematical form of the potential energy depends on the force involved.\n+We can also obtain Eq. 6-9 using Section 6-2. The work done, and hence APE, equals the area\nunder the F vs. x graph of Fig. 6-15. This area is a triangle (colored in Fig. 6-15) of altitude kx and\nbase x, and hence of area (for a triangle) equal to {(kx)(x) = { kx2.\n148 CHAPTER 6 Work and Energy\n', 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': '6-5 Conservative and\nNonconservative Forces\nThe work done against gravity in moving an object from one point to another\ndoes not depend on the path taken. For example, it takes the same work\n(= mgh) to lift an object of mass m vertically a height h as to carry it up an\nincline of the same vertical height, as in Fig. 6-4 (see Example 6-2). Forces\nsuch as gravity, for which the work done does not depend on the path taken but\nonly on the initial and final positions, are called conservative forces. The elastic\nforce of a spring (or other elastic material), in which F = - kx, is also a conser-\nvative force. An object that starts at a given point and returns to that same point\nunder the action of a conservative force has no net work done on it because the\npotential energy is the same at the start and the finish of such a round trip.\nMany forces, such as friction and a push or pull exerted by a person, are\nnonconservative forces since any work they do depends on the path. For example,\nif you push a crate across a floor from one point to another, the work you do\ndepends on whether the path taken is straight or is curved. As shown in Fig. 6-16,\nif a crate is pushed slowly from point 1 to point 2 along the longer semicircular\npath, you do more work against friction than if you push it along the straight path.\nFfr\n1\n1\nFp\nFfr\nFfr\nFP\nFp\nFIGURE 6-16 A crate is pushed slowly at\nconstant speed across a rough floor from\nposition 1 to position 2 via two paths, one\nstraight and one curved. The pushing\nforce Fp is in the direction of motion at\neach point. (The friction force opposes the\nmotion.) Hence for a constant magnitude\npushing force, the work it does is W = Fpd,\nso if the distance traveled d is greater (as for\nthe curved path), then W is greater. The work\ndone does not depend only on points 1 and 2;\nit also depends on the path taken.\n2\nYou do more work on the curved path because the distance is greater and, unlike\nthe gravitational force, the pushing force Fp is in the direction of motion at\neach point. Thus the work done by the person in Fig. 6-16 does not depend only on\npoints 1 and 2; it depends also on the path taken. The force of kinetic friction, also\nshown in Fig. 6-16, always opposes the motion; it too is a nonconservative force,\nand we discuss how to treat it later in this Chapter (Section 6-9). Table 6-1 lists a\nfew conservative and nonconservative forces.\nBecause potential energy is energy associated with the position or configura-\ntion of objects, potential energy can only make sense if it can be stated uniquely\nfor a given point. This cannot be done with nonconservative forces because the\nwork done depends on the path taken (as in Fig. 6-16). Hence, potential energy\ncan be defined only for a conservative force. Thus, although potential energy is\nalways associated with a force, not all forces have a potential energy. For example,\nthere is no potential energy for friction.\nTABLE 6-1 Conservative and\nNonconservative Forces\nConservative\nForces\nNonconservative\nForces\nGravitational\nFriction\nElastic\nAir resistance\nElectric\nTension in cord\nMotor or rocket\npropulsion\nPush or pull by\na person\nEXERCISE E An object acted on by a constant force F moves from point 1 to point 2\nand back again.

If the rock starts from rest, all of the initial energy\nis potential energy. As the rock falls, the potential energy mgy decreases (because\nthe rock's height above the ground y decreases), but the rock's kinetic energy\nincreases to compensate, so that the sum of the two remains constant. At any point\nalong the path, the total mechanical energy is given by\nE = KE + PE = 2mv2 + mgy\nwhere v is its speed at that point. If we let the subscript 1 represent the rock at one\npoint along its path (for example, the initial point), and the subscript 2 represent\nit at some other point, then we can write\ntotal mechanical energy at point 1 = total mechanical energy at point 2\nor (see also Eq. 6-12a)\n¿mv2 + mgy1 = {mv2 + mgy2.\n[gravity only] (6-13)\nJust before the rock hits the ground, where we chose y = 0, all of the initial poten-\ntial energy will have been transformed into kinetic energy.\nEXAMPLE 6-7\nFalling rock. If the initial height of the rock in Fig. 6-17 is\ny1 = h = 3.0 m, calculate the rock's velocity when it has fallen to 1.0 m above\nthe ground.\nAPPROACH We apply the principle of conservation of mechanical energy,\nEq. 6-13, with only gravity acting on the rock. We choose the ground as our\nreference level (y = 0).\nSOLUTION At the moment of release (point 1) the rock's position is\ny1 = 3.0 m and it is at rest: V1 = 0.

For example, Fig. 6-18 shows a roller-coaster car starting\nfrom rest at the top of a hill and coasting without friction to the bottom and up\nthe hill on the other side. True, there is another force besides gravity acting\non the car, the normal force exerted by the tracks. But the normal force\nacts perpendicular to the direction of motion at each point and so does zero\nwork. We ignore rotational motion of the car's wheels and treat the car as a\nparticle undergoing simple translation. Initially, the car has only potential energy.\nAs it coasts down the hill, it loses potential energy and gains in kinetic energy,\nbut the sum of the two remains constant. At the bottom of the hill it has\nits maximum kinetic energy, and as it climbs up the other side the kinetic\nenergy changes back to potential energy. When the car comes to rest again at\nthe same height from which it started, all of its energy will be potential energy.\nGiven that the gravitational potential energy is proportional to the vertical height,\nenergy conservation tells us that (in the absence of friction) the car comes to rest\nat a height equal to its original height. If the two hills are the same height, the car\nwill just barely reach the top of the second hill when it stops. If the second hill is\nlower than the first, not all of the car's kinetic energy will be transformed to poten-\ntial energy and the car can continue over the top and down the other side. If the\nsecond hill is higher, the car will reach a maximum height on it equal to its original\nheight on the first hill. This is true (in the absence of friction) no matter how steep\nthe hill is, since potential energy depends only on the vertical height (Eq. 6-6).\nEXAMPLE 6-8\nRoller-coaster car speed using energy conservation.\nAssuming the height of the hill in Fig. 6-18 is 40 m, and the roller-coaster car\nstarts from rest at the top, calculate (a) the speed of the roller-coaster car at\nthe bottom of the hill, and (b) at what height it will have half this speed. Take\ny = 0 at the bottom of the hill.\nAPPROACH We use conservation of mechanical energy. We choose point 1 to\nbe where the car starts from rest (v1 = 0) at the top of the hill (y1 = 40 m). In\npart (a), point 2 is the bottom of the hill, which we choose as our reference level,\nSO y2 = 0. In part (b) we let y2 be the unknown.\nSOLUTION (a) We use Eq. 6-13 with 01 = 0 and y2 = 0, which gives\nmgy1 = 2mv2\nor\nV2 = V2gy1\n= \\2(9.8m/s2)(40 m) = 28m/s.\n(b) Now y2 will be an unknown. We again use conservation of energy,\n¿mv2 + mgy1 = 2mv2 + mgy2,\nbut now V2 = 2 (28 m/s) = 14 m/s and v1 = 0. Solving for the unknown y2 gives\n2\ny2 = y1 -\n2g\n(14 m/s)2\n= 40 m -\n2(9.8 m/s2)\n= 30 m.\nThat is, the car has a speed of 14 m/s when it is 30 vertical meters above the lowest\npoint, both when descending the left-hand hill and when ascending the right-hand\nhill.\nThe mathematics of the roller-coaster Example 6-8 is almost the same as in\nExample 6-7. But there is an important difference between them. In Example 6-7\nthe motion is all vertical and could have been solved using force, acceleration,\nand the kinematic equations (Eqs. 2-11). For the roller coaster, where the motion is\nnot vertical, we could not have used Eqs. 2-11 because a is not constant on the\ncurved track of Example 6-8.

We often have to make approxima-\ntions, but the sequence of events in broad outline for the pole vault is as follows.\nThe initial kinetic energy of the running athlete is transformed into elastic\npotential energy of the bending pole and, as the athlete leaves the ground, into\ngravitational potential energy. When the vaulter reaches the top and the pole\nhas straightened out again, the energy has all been transformed into gravitational\npotential energy (if we ignore the vaulter's low horizontal speed over the bar). The\npole does not supply any energy, but it acts as a device to store energy and thus aid\nin the transformation of kinetic energy into gravitational potential energy, which\nis the net result. The energy required to pass over the bar depends on how high the\ncenter of mass (CM) of the vaulter must be raised. By bending their bodies, pole\nvaulters keep their CM so low that it can actually pass slightly beneath the bar\n(Fig. 6-21), thus enabling them to cross over a higher bar than would otherwise\nbe possible.

A dart of mass 0.100 kg is pressed against\nthe spring of a toy dart gun as shown in Fig. 6-22a. The spring, with spring\nstiffness constant k = 250 N/m and ignorable mass, is compressed 6.0 cm\nand released. If the dart detaches from the spring when the spring reaches its\nnatural length (x = 0), what speed does the dart acquire?\nAPPROACH The dart is initially at rest (point 1), so KE1 = 0. We ignore friction\nand use conservation of mechanical energy; the only potential energy is elastic.\nSOLUTION We use Eq. 6-14 with point 1 being at the maximum compression\nof the spring, so v1 = 0 (dart not yet released) and x1 = - 0.060 m. Point 2 we\nchoose to be the instant the dart flies off the end of the spring (Fig. 6-22b), so\nX2 = 0 and we want to find v2 .

A ball of mass m = 2.60 kg,\nstarting from rest, falls a vertical distance h = 55.0 cm before striking a\nvertical coiled spring, which it compresses an amount Y = 15.0 cm (Fig. 6-23).\nDetermine the spring stiffness constant k of the spring. Assume the spring has\nnegligible mass, and ignore air resistance. Measure all distances from the point\nwhere the ball first touches the uncompressed spring (y = 0 at this point).\nAPPROACH The forces acting on the ball are the gravitational pull of the\nEarth and the elastic force exerted by the spring. Both forces are conservative,\nso we can use conservation of mechanical energy, including both types of poten-\ntial energy. We must be careful, however: gravity acts throughout the fall\n(Fig. 6-23), whereas the elastic force does not act until the ball touches the spring\n(Fig. 6-23b). We choose y positive upward, and y = 0 at the end of the spring in\nits natural (uncompressed) state.\nSOLUTION We divide this solution into two parts. (An alternate solution follows.)\nPart 1: Let us first consider the energy changes as the ball falls from a height\ny1= h = 0.550 m, Fig. 6-23a, to y2 = 0, just as it touches the spring, Fig. 6-23b.\nOur system is the ball acted on by gravity plus the spring (which up to this point\ndoesn't do anything). Thus\n2\n12\n+\n0 + mgh = {}+ 0.\n=\n2\n1\nWe solve for v2 = V2gh = \\/2(9.80 m/s2)(0.550 m) = 3.283 m/s ~ 3.28 m/s.\nThis is the speed of the ball just as it touches the top of the spring, Fig. 6-23b.\nPart 2: As the ball compresses the spring, Figs. 6-23b to c, there are two conser-\nvative forces on the ball-gravity and the spring force. So our conservation of\nenergy equation is\nE2 (ball touches spring) = E3 (spring compressed)\n[ mvz + mgy2+/ky/ =/mo3+mgy3 +/ky.\nSubstituting y2 = 0, 02 = 3.283 m/s, V3 = 0 (the ball comes to rest for an\ninstant), and y3 = - Y = - 0.150 m, we have\n2moz + 0 + 0 = 0 - mgY + 1k (-Y)2.\nWe know m, 02, and Y, so we can solve for k:\nk = ~ 2 imo2 +mgY] = v= [02+2gY]\n=\n(2.60 kg)\n[(3.283 m/s)2 + 2(9.80 m/s2)(0.150 m)] = 1590 N/m.\n(0.150 m)2\n154 CHAPTER 6\n", 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Alternate Solution Instead of dividing the solution into two parts, we can do it\nall at once.

Point 1 is the initial point just before the ball starts to fall (Fig. 6-23a),\nSO V1 = 0, and y1 = h = 0.550 m. Point 3 is when the spring is fully compressed\n(Fig. 6-23c), so V3 = 0, y3 = - Y = - 0.150 m. The forces on the ball in this\nprocess are gravity and (at least part of the time) the spring.

These include electric energy, nuclear\nenergy, thermal energy, and the chemical energy stored in food and fuels.\nThese other forms of energy are considered to be kinetic or potential energy\nat the atomic or molecular level. For example, according to atomic theory,\nthermal energy is the kinetic energy of rapidly moving molecules-when an\nobject is heated, the molecules that make up the object move faster. On the\nother hand, the energy stored in food or in a fuel such as gasoline is regarded\nas potential energy stored by virtue of the relative positions of the atoms within\na molecule due to electric forces between the atoms (chemical bonds). The\nenergy in chemical bonds can be released through chemical reactions. This is\nanalogous to a compressed spring which, when released, can do work. Electric,\nmagnetic, and nuclear energies also can be considered examples of kinetic and\npotential (or stored) energies. We will deal with these other forms of energy\nin later Chapters.\nEnergy can be transformed from one form to another. For example, a rock\nheld high in the air has potential energy; as it falls, it loses potential energy and\ngains in kinetic energy. Potential energy is being transformed into kinetic energy.\nOften the transformation of energy involves a transfer of energy from one\nobject to another. The potential energy stored in the spring of Fig. 6-13b is\ntransformed into the kinetic energy of the ball, Fig. 6-13c. Water at the top of a\nwaterfall (Fig. 6-24) or a dam has potential energy, which is transformed into\nkinetic energy as the water falls. At the base of a dam, the kinetic energy of the\nwater can be transferred to turbine blades and further transformed into electric\nenergy, as discussed later. The potential energy stored in a bent bow can be\ntransformed into kinetic energy of the arrow (Fig. 6-25).\nIn each of these examples, the transfer of energy is accompanied by the\nperformance of work. The spring of Fig. 6-13 does work on the ball. Water does\nwork on turbine blades. A bow does work on an arrow. This observation gives us\na further insight into the relation between work and energy: work is done when\nenergy is transferred from one object to another.+\nFIGURE 6-24 Gravitational\npotential energy of water at the top\nof Yosemite Falls gets transformed\ninto kinetic energy as the water\nfalls. (Some of the energy is\ntransformed into heat by air\nresistance, and some into sound.)\nFIGURE 6-25 Potential energy of a\nbent bow about to be transformed\ninto kinetic energy of an arrow.\n* If the objects are at different temperatures, heat can flow between them instead, or in addition. See\nChapters 14 and 15.\nSECTION 6-8 Other Forms of Energy and Energy Transformations; The Law of Conservation of Energy\n155\n', 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': "One of the great results of physics is that whenever energy is transferred or\ntransformed, it is found that no energy is gained or lost in the process.\nThis is the law of conservation of energy, one of the most important princi-\nples in physics; it can be stated as:\nLAW OF\nCONSERVATION\nOF ENERGY\nThe total energy is neither increased nor decreased in any process. Energy\ncan be transformed from one form to another, and transferred from one\nobject to another, but the total amount remains constant.\nWe have already discussed the conservation of energy for mechanical systems\ninvolving conservative forces, and we saw how it could be derived from Newton's\nlaws and thus is equivalent to them. But in its full generality, the validity of the\nlaw of conservation of energy, encompassing all forms of energy including those\nassociated with nonconservative forces like friction, rests on experimental obser-\nvation. Even though Newton's laws are found to fail in the submicroscopic world\nof the atom, the law of conservation of energy has been found to hold in every\nexperimental situation so far tested.\n6-9 Energy Conservation with\nDissipative Forces: Solving Problems\nIn our applications of energy conservation in Section 6-7, we neglected friction\nand other nonconservative forces. But in many situations they cannot be ignored.\nIn a real situation, the roller-coaster car in Fig. 6-18, for example, will not in fact\nreach the same height on the second hill as it had on the first hill because of fric-\ntion. In this, and in other natural processes, the mechanical energy (sum of the\nkinetic and potential energies) does not remain constant but decreases. Because\nfrictional forces reduce the mechanical energy (but not the total energy), they are\ncalled dissipative forces. Historically, the presence of dissipative forces hindered\nthe formulation of a comprehensive conservation of energy law until well into\nthe nineteenth century. It was only then that heat, which is always produced\nwhen there is friction (try rubbing your hands together), was interpreted in terms\nof energy. Quantitative studies by nineteenth-century scientists (discussed in\nChapters 14 and 15) demonstrated that if heat is considered as a transfer of\nenergy (thermal energy), then the total energy is conserved in any process. For\nexample, if the roller-coaster car in Fig. 6-18 is subject to frictional forces,\nthen the initial total energy of the car will be equal to the kinetic plus potential\nenergy of the car at any subsequent point along its path plus the amount of\nthermal energy produced in the process (equal to the work done by friction).\nLet us recall the general form of the work-energy principle, Eq. 6-10:\nWNC = AKE + APE,\nwhere WNc is the work done by nonconservative forces such as friction. Consider\nan object, such as a roller-coaster car, as a particle moving under gravity with\nnonconservative forces like friction acting on it. When the object moves from some\npoint 1 to another point 2, then\nWNC = KE2 - KE1 + PE2 - PE1 .\nWe can rewrite this as\nKE1 + PE1 + WNC = KE2 + PE2 .\n(6-15)\nFor the case of friction, WNC = - Ffrd, where d is the distance over which the friction\n(assumed constant) acts as the object moves from point 1 to point 2. (F and d are\nin opposite directions, hence the minus sign from cos 180° = - 1 in Eq. 6-1.)\n156 CHAPTER 6 Work and Energy\n", 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'With KE = 2mv2 and PE = mgy, Eq. 6-15 with WNC = - Ffrd becomes\n1\n2\n2\n-\ngravity and\nfriction acting\n(6-16a)\nThat is, the initial mechanical energy is reduced by the amount Ffrd.

As such, they are statements of conservation of\nenergy. When other forms of energy are involved, such as chemical or electrical\nenergy, the total amount of energy is always found to be conserved. Hence the\nlaw of conservation of energy is believed to be universally valid.\nEXERCISE F Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 138, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nWork-Energy versus Energy Conservation\nThe law of conservation of energy is more general and more powerful than the\nwork-energy principle. Indeed, the work-energy principle should not be viewed\nas a statement of conservation of energy. It is nonetheless useful for mechanical\nproblems; and whether you use it, or use the more powerful conservation of\nenergy, can depend on your choice of the system under study. If you choose as\nyour system a particle or rigid object on which external forces do work, then you\ncan use the work-energy principle: the work done by the external forces on your\nobject equals the change in its kinetic energy.\nOn the other hand, if you choose a system on which no external forces do\nwork, then you need to apply conservation of energy to that system directly.\nConsider, for example, a spring connected to a block on a frictionless table\n(Fig. 6-26). If you choose the block as your system, then the work done on the\nblock by the spring equals the change in kinetic energy of the block: the work-\nenergy principle. (Energy conservation does not apply to this system-the block\'s\nenergy changes.) If instead you choose the block plus the spring as your system,\nno external forces do work (since the spring is part of the chosen system).\nTo this system you need to apply conservation of energy: if you compress the spring\nand then release it, the spring still exerts a forcet on the block, but the subsequent\nmotion can be discussed in terms of kinetic energy (2 mv2) plus potential energy\n(4 kx2), whose total remains constant.\nYou may also wonder sometimes whether to approach a problem using work\nand energy, or instead to use Newton\'s laws. As a rough guideline, if the force(s)\ninvolved are constant, either approach may succeed. If the forces are not constant,\nand/or the path is not simple, energy may be the better approach because it is\na scalar.\nProblem solving is not a process that can be done by simply following a set\nof rules. The Problem Solving Strategy on the next page, like all others, is thus\nnot a prescription, but is a summary to help you get started solving problems involv-\ning energy.\n+ The force the spring exerts on the block, and the force the block exerts back on the spring, are not\n"external" forces-they are within the system.\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nChoosing the system\nk\nm\nFIGURE 6-26 A spring connected\nto a block on a frictionless table.\nIf you choose your system to be the\nblock plus spring, then\nE = 2mv2 + 2kx2\nis conserved.\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nUse energy, or Newton\'s laws?\nSECTION 6-9 Energy Conservation with Dissipative Forces: Solving Problems 157\n', 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'VING\nConservation of Energy\nPROBLEM\n1.

The\nroller-coaster car in Example 6-8 reaches a vertical height of only 25 m on the\nsecond hill, where it slows to a momentary stop, Fig. 6-27. It traveled a total\ndistance of 400 m. Determine the thermal energy produced and estimate the\naverage friction force (assume it is roughly constant) on the car, whose mass is\n1000 kg.\nSOLUTION\n1. Draw a picture. See Fig. 6-27.\n2. The system. The system is the roller-coaster car and the Earth (which exerts\nthe gravitational force). The forces acting on the car are gravity and friction.\n(The normal force also acts on the car, but does no work, so it does not affect\nthe energy.) Gravity is accounted for as potential energy, and friction as\na term Ffrd.\n3. Choose initial and final positions. We take point 1 to be the instant when the\ncar started coasting (at the top of the first hill), and point 2 to be the instant\nit stopped at a height of 25 m up the second hill.\n4. Choose a reference frame. We choose the lowest point in the motion to be\ny = 0 for the gravitational potential energy.\n5. Is mechanical energy conserved? No. Friction is present.\n6. Apply conservation of energy. There is friction acting on the car, so we use\nconservation of energy in the form of Eq. 6-16b, with v1 = 0, y1 = 40 m,\nV2 = 0, y2 = 25 m, and d = 400 m. Thus\n0 + (1000 kg)(9.8 m/s2)(40 m) = 0 + (1000 kg)(9.8 m/s2)(25 m) + Ffrd.\n7. Solve. We solve the above equation for Ffrd, the energy dissipated to thermal\nenergy:\nFfrd = mg Ah = (1000 kg)(9.8 m/s2)(40 m - 25 m) = 147,000 J.\nThe friction force, which acts over a distance of 400 m, averages out to be\nFfr = (1.47 × 105 J)/400 m = 370 N.\nNOTE This result is only a rough average: the friction force at various points\ndepends on the normal force, which varies with slope.\n158 CHAPTER 6 Work and Energy\n', 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 22, 'type': 'text', 'content': "6-10 Power\nPower is defined as the rate at which work is done. Average power equals the\nwork done divided by the time to do it. Power can also be defined as the rate at\nwhich energy is transformed. Thus\nwork\n=\nenergy transformed\nP = average power\n.\n(6-17)\ntime\ntime\nThe power rating of an engine refers to how much chemical or electrical energy\ncan be transformed into mechanical energy per unit time. In SI units, power is meas-\nured in joules per second, and this unit is given a special name, the watt (W):\n1 W = 1 J/s. We are most familiar with the watt for electrical devices, such as\nthe rate at which an electric lightbulb or heater changes electric energy into light\nor thermal energy. But the watt is used for other types of energy transformations\nas well.\nIn the British system, the unit of power is the foot-pound per second (ft . lb/s).\nFor practical purposes, a larger unit is often used, the horsepower. One horsepower+\n(hp) is defined as 550 ft · lb/s, which equals 746 W. An engine's power is usually\nspecified in hp or in kW (1 kW ~ 1}hp) *.\nTo see the distinction between energy and power, consider the following\nexample. A person is limited in the work he or she can do, not only by the total\nenergy required, but also by how fast this energy is transformed: that is, by power.\nFor example, a person may be able to walk a long distance or climb many flights\nof stairs before having to stop because so much energy has been expended.\nOn the other hand, a person who runs very quickly up stairs may feel exhausted\nafter only a flight or two. He or she is limited in this case by power, the rate at\nwhich his or her body can transform chemical energy into mechanical energy.\nCAUTION\nDistinguish between\npower and energy\nEXAMPLE 6-13\nStair-climbing power. A 60-kg jogger runs up a long\nflight of stairs in 4.0 s (Fig. 6-28). The vertical height of the stairs is 4.5 m.\n(a) Estimate the jogger's power output in watts and horsepower. (b) How\nmuch energy did this require?\nFIGURE 6-28 Example 6-13.\nAPPROACH The work done by the jogger is against gravity, and equals\nW = mgy. To get her average power output, we divide W by the time it took.\nSOLUTION (a) The average power output was\np = w = mgy -.\n4.0 s\n(60 kg) (9.8 m/s2) (4.5 m)\n= 660 W.\nSince there are 746 W in 1 hp, the jogger is doing work at a rate of just under 1 hp.\nA human cannot do work at this rate for very long.\n(b) The energy required is E = Pt = (660 J/s)(4.0s) = 2600 J. This result equals\nW = mgy.\nNOTE The person had to transform more energy than this 2600 J. The total\nenergy transformed by a person or an engine always includes some thermal\nenergy (recall how hot you get running up stairs).\nAutomobiles do work to overcome the force of friction and air resistance,\nto climb hills, and to accelerate. A car is limited by the rate at which it can do\nwork, which is why automobile engines are rated in horsepower or kilowatts.\n+ The unit was chosen by James Watt (1736-1819), who needed a way to specify the power of his\nnewly developed steam engines. He found by experiment that a good horse can work all day at an\naverage rate of about 360 ft · lb/s. So as not to be accused of exaggeration in the sale of his steam\nengines, he multiplied this by 12 when he defined the hp.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nPower needs of a car\n*1kW = (1000 W)/(746 W/hp) ~ 1}hp.\nSECTION 6-10 Power 159\n", 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 23, 'type': 'text', 'content': "FN\ny\nmg sin 10°\nFR\nB\n10°\nmg\nFIGURE 6-29 Example 6-14.\nCalculation of power needed for a\ncar to climb a hill.\n> x\nA car needs power most when climbing hills and when accelerating. In the next\nExample, we will calculate how much power is needed in these situations for a\ncar of reasonable size. Even when a car travels on a level road at constant\nspeed, it needs some power just to do work to overcome the retarding forces of\ninternal friction and air resistance. These forces depend on the conditions and\nspeed of the car, but are typically in the range 400 N to 1000 N.\nIt is often convenient to write power in terms of the net force F applied to an\nobject and its speed v. This is readily done because P = W/t and W = Fd, where\nd is the distance traveled. Then\np = W = Fd = FŪ,\nFd\n(6-18)\nwhere ৳ = d/t is the average speed of the object.\nEXAMPLE 6-14\nPower needs of a car. Calculate the power required of a\n1400-kg car under the following circumstances: (a) the car climbs a 10° hill\n(a fairly steep hill) at a steady 80 km/h; and (b) the car accelerates along a level\nroad from 90 to 110 km/h in 6.0 s to pass another car. Assume the average\nretarding force on the car is FR = 700 N throughout. See Fig. 6-29.\nAPPROACH First we must be careful not to confuse FR, which is due to air\nresistance and friction that retards the motion, with the force F needed to accel-\nerate the car, which is the frictional force exerted by the road on the tires-the\nreaction to the motor-driven tires pushing against the road. We must determine\nthe magnitude of the force F before calculating the power.\nSOLUTION (a) To move at a steady speed up the hill, the car must, by New-\nton's second law, exert a force F equal to the sum of the retarding force, 700 N,\nand the component of gravity parallel to the hill, mg sin 10°, Fig. 6-29. Thus\nF = 700 N + mg sin 10°\n= 700N + (1400 kg)(9.80 m/s2)(0.174) = 3100 N.\nSince ৳= 80 km/h = 22 m/s+ and is parallel to F, then (Eq. 6-18) the power is\nP= F5= (3100 N)(22 m/s) = 6.8 × 104 W = 68 kW = 91 hp.\n(b) The car accelerates from 25.0 m/s to 30.6 m/s (90 to 110 km/h) on the flat.\nThe car must exert a force that overcomes the 700-N retarding force plus that\nrequired to give it the acceleration\nax =\n(30.6 m/s - 25.0m/s)\n=\n0.93 m/s2.\n6.0 s\nWe apply Newton's second law with x being the horizontal direction of motion\n(no component of gravity):\nmax = >Fx = F - FR.\nWe solve for the force required, F:\nF = max + FR\n= (1400 kg)(0.93 m/s2) + 700N = 1300 N + 700N = 2000 N.\nSince P = Fr, the required power increases with speed and the motor must be\nable to provide a maximum power output in this case of\nP = (2000 N)(30.6 m/s) = 6.1 × 104 W = 61 kW = 82 hp.\nNOTE Even taking into account the fact that only 60 to 80% of the engine's\npower output reaches the wheels, it is clear from these calculations that an engine\nof 75 to 100 KW (100 to 130 hp) is adequate from a practical point of view.\n+ Recall 1 km/h = 1000 m/3600 s = 0.278 m/s.\n160 CHAPTER 6 Work and Energy\n", 'chapter_title': 'Work and Energy'}, {'page_number': 24, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'We mentioned in Example 6-14 that only part of the energy output of a car\nengine reaches the wheels.

An important characteristic of\nall engines is their overall efficiency e, defined as the ratio of the useful power\noutput of the engine, Pout, to the power input, Pin (provided by burning of gaso-\nline, for example):\ne = Pour\nPin\nThe efficiency is always less than 1.0 because no engine can create energy, and\nno engine can even transform energy from one form to another without some\nenergy going to friction, thermal energy, and other nonuseful forms of energy.\nFor example, an automobile engine converts chemical energy released in the burn-\ning of gasoline into mechanical energy that moves the pistons and eventually the\nwheels. But nearly 85% of the input energy is "wasted" as thermal energy that\ngoes into the cooling system or out the exhaust pipe, plus friction in the moving\nparts.

An object of\nmass m and speed v has translational kinetic energy\nKE = {mv2.\n(6-3)\nThe work-energy principle states that the net work done on\nan object (by the net force) equals the change in kinetic energy\nof that object:\nWnet = AKE = mom.\n(6-4)\nPotential energy (PE) is energy associated with forces that\ndepend on the position or configuration of objects. Gravitational\npotential energy is\nPEG = mgy,\n(6-6)\nwhere y is the height of the object of mass m above an arbitrary\nreference point. Elastic potential energy is given by\nPEel = 2kx2\n(6-9)\nfor a stretched or compressed spring, where x is the displacement\nfrom the unstretched position and k is the spring stiffness con-\nstant. Other potential energies include chemical, electrical, and\nnuclear energy. The change in potential energy when an object\nchanges position is equal to the external work needed to take\nthe object from one position to the other.\nPotential energy is associated only with conservative forces,\nfor which the work done by the force in moving an object from\none position to another depends only on the two positions and\nnot on the path taken. Nonconservative forces like friction are\ndifferent-work done by them does depend on the path taken\nand potential energy cannot be defined for them.\nThe law of conservation of energy states that energy can\nbe transformed from one type to another, but the total energy\nremains constant. It is valid even when friction is present,\nbecause the heat generated can be considered a form of energy\ntransfer. When only conservative forces act, the total mechanical\nenergy is conserved:\nKE + PE = constant.\n(6-12)\nWhen nonconservative forces such as friction act, then\nWNC = AKE + APE,\n(6-10, 6-15)\nwhere WNC is the work done by nonconservative forces.\nPower is defined as the rate at which work is done, or the\nrate at which energy is transformed. The SI unit of power is\nthe watt (1 W = 1J/s).\nQuestions\n1. In what ways is the word "work" as used in everyday lan-\nguage the same as it is defined in physics? In what ways is\nit different?
