We will be concerned mainly with the first situation, in which the\nobject or objects are all at rest, or static (= not moving).\nThe net force and the net torque can be zero, but this does not imply that no\nforces at all act on the objects. In fact it is virtually impossible to find an object on\nwhich no forces act. Just how and where these forces act can be very important,\nboth for buildings and other structures, and in the human body.\nSometimes, as we shall see in this Chapter, the forces may be so great that\nthe object is seriously deformed, or it may even fracture (break)-and avoiding\nsuch problems gives this field of statics even greater importance.\n', 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Statics is concerned with the calculation of the forces acting on and within\nstructures that are in equilibrium. Determination of these forces, which occupies\nus in the first part of this Chapter, then allows a determination of whether the\nstructures can sustain the forces without significant deformation or fracture, sub-\njects we discuss later in this Chapter. These techniques can be applied in a wide\nrange of fields. Architects and engineers must be able to calculate the forces on\nthe structural components of buildings, bridges, machines, vehicles, and other\nstructures, since any material will buckle or break if too much force is applied\n(Fig. 9-1). In the human body a knowledge of the forces in muscles and joints is\nof great value for doctors, physical therapists, and athletes.\n9-1 The Conditions for Equilibrium\nObjects in daily life have at least one force acting on them (gravity). If they are at\nrest, then there must be other forces acting on them as well so that the net force is\nzero. A book at rest on a table, for example, has two forces acting on it, the\ndownward force of gravity and the normal force the table exerts upward on it\n(Fig. 9-2). Because the book is at rest, Newton\'s second law tells us that the net\nforce on it is zero. Thus the upward force exerted by the table on the book must\nbe equal in magnitude to the force of gravity acting downward on the book. Such\nan object is said to be in equilibrium (Latin for "equal forces" or "balance")\nunder the action of these two forces.\nDo not confuse the two forces in Fig. 9-2 with the equal and opposite forces\nof Newton\'s third law, which act on different objects. In Fig. 9-2, both forces act on the\nsame object; and they happen to add up to zero.\nEXAMPLE 9-1\nStraightening teeth. The wire band shown in Fig. 9-3a has\na tension FT of 2.0 N along it.

Actually that is not quite so\nsince the objective is to move the tooth ever so slowly.\nNOTE If the wire is firmly attached to the tooth, the tension to the right, say,\ncan be made larger than that to the left, and the resultant force would corre-\nspondingly be directed more toward the right.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nBraces for teeth\nSECTION 9-1 The Conditions for Equilibrium 231\n', 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': "60°\ny\n+\nFA\n+ X\nFB\n1960 N\n(a)\n200 kg\nFA\ny\nFAY\n60°\n-\nx\n(b)\nFIGURE 9-4 Example 9-2.\nFAX\nFIGURE 9-5 Although the net force\non it is zero, the ruler will move\n(rotate). A pair of equal forces acting\nin opposite directions but at different\npoints on an object (as shown here) is\nreferred to as a couple.\nB\nF\nThe First Condition for Equilibrium\nFor an object to be at rest, Newton's second law tells us that the sum of the forces\nacting on it must add up to zero. Since force is a vector, the components of the\nnet force must each be zero. Hence, a condition for equilibrium is that\n≥Fx=0,\n≥Fy = 0,\nEF2=0.\n(9-1)\nWe will mainly be dealing with forces that act in a plane, so we usually need only\nthe x and y components. We must remember that if a particular force component\npoints along the negative x or y axis, it must have a negative sign. Equations 9-1\nrepresent the first condition for equilibrium.\nWe saw in Chapter 4 that to solve Problems involving forces, we need to draw\na free-body diagram, indicating all the forces on a given object (see Section 4-7).\nEXAMPLE 9-2\nChandelier cord tension. Calculate the tensions FA and FB\nin the two cords that are connected to the vertical cord supporting the 200-kg\nchandelier in Fig. 9-4. Ignore the mass of the cords.\nAPPROACH We need a free-body diagram, but for which object? If we choose\nthe chandelier, the cord supporting it must exert a force equal to the chande-\nlier's weight mg = (200 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 1960 N. But the forces FA and FB don't\nget involved. Instead, let us choose as our object the point where the three\ncords join (it could be a knot). The free-body diagram is then as shown in\nFig. 9-4a. The three forces-FA, FB, and the tension in the vertical cord equal\nto the weight of the 200-kg chandelier-act at this point where the three cords\njoin. For this junction point we write EFx = 0 and EFy = 0, since the problem\nis laid out in two dimensions. The directions of FA and FB are known, since\ntension in a cord can only be along the cord-any other direction would cause\nthe cord to bend, as already pointed out in Chapter 4. Thus, our unknowns are\nthe magnitudes FA and FB .\nSOLUTION We first resolve FA into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) compo-\nnents. Although we don't know the value of FA, we can write (see Fig. 9-4b)\nFAX = - FA COS 60° and FAy = FA sin 60º. FB has only an x component. In the\nvertical direction, we have the downward force exerted by the vertical cord\nequal to the weight of the chandelier mg = (200 kg)(g), and the vertical com-\nponent of FA upward:\nFA sin 60° - (200 kg)(g) = 0\nΣΕy = 0\nSO\nFA =\n(200 kg)g\nsin 60°\n= (231 kg)g = (231 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 2260 N.\nIn the horizontal direction, with ≥Fx = 0,\nEFx = FB - FA COS 60° = 0.\nThus\nFB = FA COS 60° = (231 kg)(g)(0.500) = (115 kg)g = 1130 N.\nThe magnitudes of FA and FB determine the strength of cord or wire that must be\nused. In this case, the cord must be able to support a mass of more than 230 kg.\nNOTE We didn't insert the value of g, the acceleration due to gravity, until the\nend. In this way we found the magnitude of the force in terms of g times the\nnumber of kilograms (which may be a more familiar quantity than newtons).\nEXERCISE A In Example 9-2, FA has to be greater than the chandelier's weight, mg.\nWhy?\nB\nThe Second Condition for Equilibrium\nAlthough Eqs. 9-1 are a necessary condition for an object to be in equilibrium,\nthey are not always a sufficient condition. Figure 9-5 shows an object on which\nthe net force is zero. Although the two forces labeled F add up to give zero net\nforce on the object, they do give rise to a net torque that will rotate the object.\n232 CHAPTER 9\n", 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Referring to Eq. 8-14, ¿T = Ia, we see that if an object is to remain at rest, the\nnet torque applied to it (calculated about any axis) must be zero. Thus we have\nthe second condition for equilibrium: that the sum of the torques acting on an\nobject, as calculated about any axis, must be zero:\nΣτ = 0.\n(9-2)\nThis condition will ensure that the angular acceleration, a, about any axis will\nbe zero. If the object is not rotating initially (@) = 0), it will not start rotating.\nEquations 9-1 and 9-2 are the only requirements for an object to be in equilibrium.\nWe will mainly consider cases in which the forces all act in a plane (we call it\nthe xy plane). In such cases the torque is calculated about an axis that is perpen-\ndicular to the xy plane. The choice of this axis is arbitrary. If the object is at rest,\nthen ET = 0 is valid about any axis. Therefore we can choose any axis that\nmakes our calculation easier. Once the axis is chosen, all torques must be calcu-\nlated about that axis.\nCAUTION\nAxis choice for Er = 0 is arbitrary.\nAll torques must be calculated\nabout the same axis.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 9-3\nA lever. The bar in Fig. 9-6 is being used\nas a lever to pry up a large rock. The small rock acts as a fulcrum (pivot point).\nThe force Fp required at the long end of the bar can be quite a bit smaller than\nthe rock\'s weight mg, since it is the torques that balance in the rotation about\nthe fulcrum. If, however, the leverage isn\'t sufficient, and the large rock isn\'t\nbudged, what are two ways to increase the lever arm?\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nThe lever\nRESPONSE One way is to increase the lever arm of the force Fp by slipping a\npipe over the end of the bar and thereby pushing with a longer lever arm.\nA second way is to move the fulcrum closer to the large rock. This may change\nthe long lever arm R only a little, but it changes the short lever arm r by a\nsubstantial fraction and therefore changes the ratio of R/r dramatically. In order\nto pry the rock, the torque due to Fp must at least balance the torque due to mg;\nthat is, mgr = Fp R and\nR\nr = Fp\nmg\n.\nR\nB\nr\nmỹ\nFIGURE 9-6 Example 9-3. A lever\ncan "multiply" your force.\nWith r smaller, the weight mg can be balanced with less force Fp. The ratio R/r\nis the mechanical advantage of the system. A lever is a "simple machine." We\ndiscussed another simple machine, the pulley, in Chapter 4, Example 4-14.\nEXERCISE B For simplicity, we wrote the equation in Example 9-3 as if the lever were\nperpendicular to the forces. Would the equation be valid even for a lever at an angle as\nshown in Fig. 9-6?\n9-2 Solving Statics Problems\nThe subject of statics is important because it allows us to calculate certain forces\non (or within) a structure when some of the forces on it are already known. We\nwill mainly consider situations in which all the forces act in a plane, so we can\nhave two force equations (x and y components) and one torque equation, for a\ntotal of three equations. Of course, you do not have to use all three equations if\nthey are not needed. When using a torque equation, a torque that tends to rotate\nthe object counterclockwise is usually considered positive, whereas a torque that\ntends to rotate it clockwise is considered negative. (But the opposite convention\nwould be OK too.)\nOne of the forces that acts on objects is the force of gravity. As we discussed\nin Section 7-8, we can consider the force of gravity on an object as acting at its\ncenter of gravity (CG) or center of mass (CM), which for practical purposes are the\nsame point. For uniform symmetrically shaped objects, the CG is at the geometric\ncenter. For more complicated objects, the CG can be determined as discussed\nin Section 7-8.\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nT > 0 counterclockwise\n0 clockwise\nSECTION 9-2 Solving Statics Problems 233\n', 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': "VING\nThere is no single technique for attacking statics problems, but the following\nprocedure may be helpful.\n.EM\nStatics\n4. For the torque equation,\n1. Choose one object at a time for consideration. Make\nPROB\na careful free-body diagram by showing all the forces\nacting on that object, including gravity, and the points\nat which these forces act. If you aren't sure of the\ndirection of a force, choose a direction; if the actual\ndirection of the force (or component of a force) is oppo-\nsite, your eventual calculation will give a result with a\nminus sign.\n2. Choose a convenient coordinate system, and resolve\nthe forces into their components.\n3.

(For example, you\ncan reduce the number of unknowns in the resulting\nequation by choosing the axis so that one of the\nunknown forces acts through that axis; then this force\nwill have zero lever arm and produce zero torque, and\nso won't appear in the torque equation.) Pay careful\nattention to determining the lever arm for each force\ncorrectly. Give each torque a + or - sign to indicate\ntorque direction. For example, if torques tending\nto rotate the object counterclockwise are positive,\nthen those tending to rotate it clockwise are negative.\n5. Solve these equations for the unknowns. Three equa-\ntions allow a maximum of three unknowns to be solved\nfor. They can be forces, distances, or even angles.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nBalancing a seesaw\nEXAMPLE 9-4\nBalancing a seesaw. A board of mass M = 4.0 kg serves\nas a seesaw for two children, as shown in Fig. 9-7a. Child A has a mass of 30 kg\nand sits 2.5 m from the pivot point, P (his center of gravity is 2.5 m from the\npivot). At what distance x from the pivot must child B, of mass 25 kg, place herself\nto balance the seesaw? Assume the board is uniform and centered over the pivot.\nAPPROACH We follow the steps of the Problem Solving Strategy above.\nSOLUTION\n1. Free-body diagram. We choose the board as our object, and assume it is hor-\nizontal. Its free-body diagram is shown in Fig. 9-7b. The forces acting on the\nboard are the forces exerted downward on it by each child, FA and FB , the\nupward force exerted by the pivot FN, and the force of gravity on the board\n(= Mg) which acts at the center of the uniform board.\n2. Coordinate system. We choose y to be vertical, with positive upward, and x\nhorizontal to the right, with origin at the pivot.\n3. Force equation.

Torque equation. Let us calculate the torque about an axis through the board\nat the pivot point, P. Then the lever arms for FN and for the weight of the\nboard are zero, and they will contribute zero torque about point P. Thus the\ntorque equation will involve only the forces FA and FB, which are equal to\nthe weights of the children. The torque exerted by each child will be mg times\nthe appropriate lever arm, which here is the distance of each child from the\npivot point. FA tends to rotate the board counterclockwise (+) and FB\nclockwise (-), so the torque equation is\n¿T = 0\nMAg(2.5m) - mgx + Mg(0m) + FN(0m) = 0\nor\nMAg(2.5m) -mgx = 0,\nwhere two terms were dropped because their lever arms were zero.\n5.

This makes sense: since she is lighter, she must sit farther from the\npivot than the heavier child in order to provide torques of equal magnitude.\nEXERCISE C We did not need to use the force equation to solve Example 9-4 because\nof our choice of the axis. Use the force equation to find the force exerted by the pivot.\nEXAMPLE 9-5\nForces on a beam and supports. A uniform 1500-kg beam,\n20.0 m long, supports a 15,000-kg printing press 5.0 m from the right support\ncolumn (Fig. 9-8). Calculate the force on each of the vertical support columns.\nAPPROACH We analyze the forces on the beam (the force the beam exerts on\neach column is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the column on the\nbeam). We label these forces FA and FB in Fig. 9-8. The weight of the beam\nitself acts at its center of gravity, 10.0 m from either end. We choose a con-\nvenient axis for writing the torque equation: the point of application of FA\n(labeled P), so FA will not enter the equation (its lever arm will be zero) and we\nwill have an equation in only one unknown, FB ·\nSOLUTION The torque equation, ÈT = 0, with the counterclockwise direction\nas positive, gives\n¿T = - (10.0 m)(1500 kg)g - (15.0 m)(15,000 kg)g + (20.0 m)FB = 0.\nSolving for FB, we find FB = (12,000 kg)g = 118,000 N. To find FA, we use\n≥Fy = 0, with +y upward:\n¿Fy = FA - (1500 kg)g - (15,000 kg)g + FB = 0.\nPutting in FB = (12,000 kg)g, we find that FA = (4500 kg)g = 44,100 N.\nFA\nP\nCG\nFB\n1\n(1500 kg)ğ\n-10.0 m-+++5.0 m++5.0m+\n(15,000 kg)ğ\nFIGURE 9-8 A 1500-kg beam supports\na 15,000-kg machine. Example 9-5.\nFigure 9-9 shows a uniform beam that extends beyond its support like a\ndiving board. Such a beam is called a cantilever. The forces acting on the beam\nin Fig. 9-9 are those due to the supports, FA and FB, and the force of gravity\nwhich acts at the CG, 5.0 m to the right of the right-hand support. If you follow\nthe procedure of the last Example and calculate FA and FB , assuming they point\nupward as shown in Fig. 9-9, you will find that FA comes out negative. If the\nbeam has a mass of 1200 kg and a weight mg = 12,000 N, then FB = 15,000 N\nand FA = - 3000 N (see Problem 10). Whenever an unknown force comes out\nnegative, it merely means that the force actually points in the opposite direction\nfrom what you assumed. Thus in Fig. 9-9, FA actually must pull downward (by\nmeans of bolts, screws, fasteners, and/or glue). To see why FA has to act downward,\nnote that the board's weight acting at the CG would otherwise rotate the board\nclockwise about support B.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nCantilever\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nIf a force comes out negative\nFIGURE 9-9 A cantilever.\nFA\nFB\n20.0 m\n-30.0 m\nA\nA\nB\nCG\nmg\nSECTION 9-2 Solving Statics Problems 235\n", 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': "FHy\nFH\nHinge\nFHx\ny\n* X\nFT\nθ\nAFTy\nFTx\nmg\nMg\nArlene's\nBook\nStore\nFIGURE 9-10 Example 9-6.\nEXERCISE D Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 230, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nOur next Example involves a beam that is attached to a wall by a hinge and\nis supported by a cable or cord (Fig. 9-10). It is important to remember that a\nflexible cable can support a force only along its length. (If there were a compo-\nnent of force perpendicular to the cable, it would bend because it is flexible.)\nBut for a rigid device, such as the hinge in Fig. 9-10, the force can be in any\ndirection and we can know the direction only after solving the equations. (The\nhinge is assumed small and smooth, so it can exert no internal torque on the beam.)\nEXAMPLE 9-6\nHinged beam and cable. A uniform beam, 2.20 m long with\nmass m = 25.0 kg, is mounted by a small hinge on a wall as shown in Fig. 9-10.\nThe beam is held in a horizontal position by a cable that makes an angle 0 = 30.0°.\nThe beam supports a sign of mass M = 28.0 kg suspended from its end. Deter-\nmine the components of the force FH that the (smooth) hinge exerts on the beam,\nand the tension Fr in the supporting cable.\nAPPROACH Figure 9-10 is the free-body diagram for the beam, showing all\nthe forces acting on the beam. It also shows the components of FT and a guess\nfor the direction of FH. We have three unknowns, FHx, FHy, and FT (we are\ngiven 0), so we will need all three equations, EFx = 0, EFy = 0, Στ=0.\nSOLUTION The sum of the forces in the vertical (y) direction is\nFHy + Fry - mg - Mg = 0.\n≥Fy = 0\n(i)\nIn the horizontal (x) direction, the sum of the forces is\nEFx =0\nFHx - FTx = 0.\n(ii)\nFor the torque equation, we choose the axis at the point where FT and Mg act.\nThen our torque equation will contain only one unknown, FHy, because the lever\narms for FT, Mg, and FHx are zero. We choose torques that tend to rotate the\nbeam counterclockwise as positive. The weight mg of the (uniform) beam acts\nat its center, so we have\nΣτ = 0\n-(FHy)(2.20m)+ mg(1.10m) = 0.\nWe solve for FHy :\nFHy = (\n1.10 m\n2.20 m\nmg = (0.500)(25.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 123 N. (iii)\nNext, since the tension FT in the cable acts along the cable (0 = 30.0°), we see\nfrom Fig. 9-10 that tan 0 = Fry/FTx, or\nFTy = FTx tan 0 = FTx (tan 30.0°).\nEquation (i) above gives\n(iv)\nFTy = (m+ M)g - FHy = (53.0kg)(9.80 m/s2) - 123 N = 396 N.\nEquations (iv) and (ii) give\nFTx = Fry/tan 30.0° = 396 N/tan 30.0° = 686 N;\nFHx = FTx = 686 N.\nThe components of FH are FHy = 123 N and FHx = 686 N. The tension in the\nwire is F1 = VFTx + F7y = V (686 N)2 + (396 N)2 = 792 N.1\n*Our calculation used numbers rounded off to 3 significant figures. If you keep an extra digit, or leave\nthe numbers in your calculator, you get FTy = 396.5 N, FTx = 686.8 N, and FT = 793 N, all within\nthe expected precision of 3 significant figures (Section 1-4).\n236 CHAPTER 9 Static Equilibrium; Elasticity and Fracture\n", 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Alternate Solution Let us see the effect of choosing a different axis for calcu-\nlating torques, such as an axis through the hinge. Then the lever arm for FH is\nzero, and the torque equation (2T = 0) becomes\n-mg(1.10 m) - Mg(2.20 m) + Fry(2.20 m) = 0.\nWe solve this for Fry and find\nFry = 28 + Mg = (12.5 kg + 28.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 397 N.\nWe get the same result, within the precision of our significant figures.\nNOTE It doesn't matter which axis we choose for ÈT = 0. Using a second axis\ncan serve as a check.\n*\nA More Difficult Example-The Ladder\nEXAMPLE 9-7\nLadder. A 5.0-m-long ladder leans against a wall at a point\n4.0 m above a cement floor as shown in Fig. 9-11. The ladder is uniform and has\nmass m = 12.0 kg. Assuming the wall is frictionless, but the floor is not, deter-\nmine the forces exerted on the ladder by the floor and by the wall.\nAPPROACH Figure 9-11 is the free-body diagram for the ladder, showing all\nthe forces acting on the ladder. The wall, since it is frictionless, can exert a force\nonly perpendicular to the wall, and we label that force Fw. The cement floor\nexerts a force Fc which has both horizontal and vertical force components:\nFcx is frictional and Fcy is the normal force. Finally, gravity exerts a force\nmg = (12.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 118 N on the ladder at its midpoint, since the\nladder is uniform.\nSOLUTION Again we use the equilibrium conditions, EFx = 0, EFy =0,\nET = 0. We will need all three since there are three unknowns: Fw , Fcx , and\nFcy. The y component of the force equation is\n≥Fy = Fcy - mg = 0,\nso immediately we have\nFcy = mg = 118 N.\nThe x component of the force equation is\n≥Fx= Fcx-Fw = 0.\nTo determine both Fcx and Fw, we need a torque equation. If we choose to\ncalculate torques about an axis through the point where the ladder touches\nthe cement floor, then Fc, which acts at this point, will have a lever arm of\nzero and so won't enter the equation. The ladder touches the floor a distance\nx0 = \\(5.0 m)2 - (4.0 m)2 = 3.0 m from the wall (right triangle, c2 = a2 + b2).\nThe lever arm for mg is half this, or 1.5 m, and the lever arm for Fw is 4.0 m,\nFig. 9-11.

Two bones are flexibly connected\nat a joint, such as at the elbow, knee, hip, and shoulder. A muscle exerts a pull when\nits fibers contract under stimulation by a nerve, but a muscle can not exert a push.\nMuscles that tend to bring two limbs closer together, such as the biceps muscle in\nthe upper arm (Fig. 9-12), are called flexors; those that act to extend a limb out-\nward, such as the triceps muscle in Fig. 9-12, are called extensors. You use the flexor\nmuscle in the upper arm when lifting an object in your hand; you use the extensor\nmuscle when throwing a ball.\nEXAMPLE 9-8\nForce exerted by biceps muscle. How much force must\nthe biceps muscle exert when a 5.0-kg ball is held in the hand (a) with the arm\nhorizontal as in Fig. 9-13a, and (b) when the arm is at a 45° angle as in Fig. 9-13b?\nThe biceps muscle is connected to the forearm by a tendon attached 5.0 cm from\nthe elbow joint. Assume that the mass of forearm and hand together is 2.0 kg\nand their CG is as shown.\nAPPROACH The free-body diagram for the forearm is shown in Fig. 9-13; the\nforces are the weights of the arm and ball, the upward force FM exerted by the\nmuscle, and a force FJ exerted at the joint by the bone in the upper arm (all\nassumed to act vertically). We wish to find the magnitude of FM , which can be done\nusing the torque equation and by choosing our axis through the joint so that\nFJ contributes zero torque.\nSOLUTION (a) We calculate torques about the point where FJ acts in Fig. 9-13a.\nThe Στ = 0 equation gives\n(0.050 m)FM - (0.15 m)(2.0kg)g - (0.35 m)(5.0kg)g = 0.\nWe solve for FM:\nFM =\n(0.15 m)(2.0 kg)g + (0.35 m)(5.0 kg)g\n= (41 kg)g = 400 N.\n0.050 m\n(b) The lever arm, as calculated about the joint, is reduced by the factor cos 45°\nfor all three forces. Our torque equation will look like the one just above, except\nthat each term will have its lever arm reduced by the same factor, which will\ncancel out. The same result is obtained, FM = 400 N.\nNOTE The force required of the muscle (400 N) is quite large compared to the\nweight of the object lifted (= mg = 49 N). Indeed, the muscles and joints of the\nbody are generally subjected to quite large forces.\nNOTE Forces exerted on joints can be large and even painful or injurious. Using\n≥Fy = 0 we calculate for this case FJ = FM - (2.0 kg)g - (5.0 kg)g = 330 N.\nThe point of insertion of a muscle varies from person to person. A slight\nincrease in the distance of the joint to the point of insertion of the biceps muscle\nfrom 5.0 cm to 5.5 cm can be a considerable advantage for lifting and throwing.\nChampion athletes are often found to have muscle insertions farther from the joint\nthan the average person, and if this applies to one muscle, it usually applies to all.\nAs another example of the large forces acting within the human body, we\nconsider the muscles used to support the body (trunk) when you bend forward\n(Fig. 9-14a). The lowest vertebra on the spinal column (fifth lumbar vertebra)\nacts as a fulcrum for this bending position. The "erector spinae" muscles in the\nback that support the trunk act at an effective angle of about 12° to the axis of\nthe spine. Let us assume the trunk makes an angle of 30° with the horizontal.\n238 CHAPTER 9 Static Equilibrium; Elasticity and Fracture\n', 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Figure 9-14b is a simplified schematic drawing showing the forces on the upper body.\nThe force exerted by the back muscles is represented by FM, the force exerted on\nthe base of the spine at the lowest vertebra is Fy, and WH, WA , and wr represent\nthe weights of the head, freely hanging arms, and trunk, respectively. The values\nshown are approximations. The distances (in cm) refer to a person 180 cm tall,\nbut are approximately in the same ratio of 1:2:3 for an average person of any\nheight, and the result in the following Example is then independent of the height\nof the person.\nEXAMPLE 9-9\nForces on your back. Calculate the magnitude and direc-\ntion of the force Fy acting on the fifth lumbar vertebra as represented in Fig. 9-14b.\nAPPROACH We use the model of the upper body described above and shown\nin Fig. 9-14b. We can calculate FM using the torque equation if we take the axis\nat the base of the spine (point S); with this choice, the other unknown, Fv, doesn\'t\nappear in the equation because its lever arm is zero. To figure the lever arms, we\nneed to use trigonometric functions.\nSOLUTION For FM, the lever arm (perpendicular distance from axis to line of\naction of the force) will be the real distance to where the force acts (48 cm) mul-\ntiplied by sin 12°, as shown in Fig. 9-14c. The lever arms for WH, WA , and WT\ncan be seen from Fig. 9-14b to be their respective distances from S times sin 60°.\nFM tends to rotate the trunk counterclockwise, which we take to be positive.\nThen WH , WA, WT will contribute negative torques. Thus 2T = 0 gives\n(0.48 m)(sin 12°)(FM) - (0.72 m)(sin 60°)(WH)\n- (0.48 m)(sin 60°)(WA) - (0.36 m)(sin 60°)(WT) = 0.\nSolving for FM and putting in the values for WH, WA , Wr given in Fig. 9-14b, we find\nFM =\n(0.72 m)(0.07w) + (0.48 m)(0.12w) + (0.36 m)(0.46w)\n(sin 60°)\n(0.48 m)(sin 12°)\n= 2.37w ~ 2.4w,\nwhere w is the total weight of the body. To get the components of Fy we use\nthe x and y components of the force equation (noting that 30° - 12º = 18°):\n≥Fy = Fvy - FM sin 18º - WH - WA - WT = 0\nSO\nFvy = 1.38w ~ 1.4w,\nand\nEFx = Fvx - FM COS 18° = 0\nSO\nFvx = 2.25w ~ 2.3w,\nwhere we keep 3 significant figures for calculating, but round off to 2 for giving\nthe answer. Then\nFv = VFux + Fry = 2.6w.\nThe angle 0 that Fy makes with the horizontal is given by tan 0 = Fvy/ Fvx = 0.61,\nso 0 = 32°.\nNOTE The force on the lowest vertebra is over 22 times the total body weight!\nThis force is exerted by the "sacral" bone at the base of the spine, through the\nsomewhat flexible intervertebral disk. The disks at the base of the spine are\nclearly being compressed under very large forces. [If the body was less bent\nover (say, the 30° angle in Fig. 9-14b becomes 40° or 50°), then the stress on the\nlower back will be less.]\nIf the person in Fig. 9-14 has a mass of 90 kg and is holding 20 kg in his hands\n(this increases WA to 0.34w), then Fy is increased to almost four times the\nperson\'s weight (3.7w).

However, if the object is displaced slightly, three\noutcomes are possible: (1) the object returns to its original position, in which case\nit is said to be in stable equilibrium; (2) the object moves even farther from its orig-\ninal position, and it is said to be in unstable equilibrium; or (3) the object remains\nin its new position, and it is said to be in neutral equilibrium.\nConsider the following examples. A ball suspended freely from a string is in\nstable equilibrium, for if it is displaced to one side, it will return to its original\nposition (Fig. 9-15a) due to the net force and torque exerted on it. On the other\nhand, a pencil standing on its point is in unstable equilibrium. If its center of grav-\nity is directly over its tip (Fig. 9-15b), the net force and net torque on it will be zero.\nBut if it is displaced ever so slightly as shown-say, by a slight vibration or tiny air\ncurrent-there will be a torque on it, and this torque acts to make the pencil continue\nto fall in the direction of the original displacement. Finally, an example of an object\nin neutral equilibrium is a sphere resting on a horizontal tabletop. If it is moved\nslightly to one side, it will remain in its new position-no net torque acts on it.\nFIGURE 9-15 (a) Stable equilibrium,\nand (b) unstable equilibrium.\nCG\nCG\nCG\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFIGURE 9-16 Equilibrium of a\nrefrigerator resting on a flat floor.\nFIGURE 9-17 Humans adjust their\nposture to achieve stability when\ncarrying loads.\nTotal\nCG\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHumans and balance\nNet\nforce\n(a)\n(b)\nIn most situations, such as in the design of structures and in working with the\nhuman body, we are interested in maintaining stable equilibrium, or balance, as we\nsometimes say. In general, an object whose center of gravity (CG) is below its point\nof support, such as a ball on a string, will be in stable equilibrium. If the CG is above\nthe base of support, we have a more complicated situation. Consider a standing\nrefrigerator (Fig. 9-16a). If it is tipped slightly, it will return to its original\nposition due to the torque on it as shown in Fig. 9-16b. But if it is tipped too far,\nFig. 9-16c, it will fall over. The critical point is reached when the CG shifts from\none side of the pivot point to the other. When the CG is on one side, the torque pulls\nthe object back onto its original base of support, Fig. 9-16b. If the object is tipped\nfurther, the CG goes past the pivot point and the torque causes the object to topple,\nFig. 9-16c. In general, an object whose center of gravity is above its base of support\nwill be stable if a vertical line projected downward from the CG falls within the base\nof support. This is because the normal force upward on the object (which balances\nout gravity) can be exerted only within the area of contact, so if the force of gravity\nacts beyond this area, a net torque will act to topple the object.\nStability, then, can be relative. A brick lying on its widest face is more stable\nthan a brick standing on its end, for it will take more of an effort to tip it over. In\nthe extreme case of the pencil in Fig. 9-15b, the base is practically a point and the\nslightest disturbance will topple it. In general, the larger the base and the lower\nthe CG, the more stable the object.\nIn this sense, humans are less stable than four-legged mammals, which have a\nlarger base of support because of their four legs, and most also have a lower center of\ngravity. When walking and performing other kinds of movement, a person con-\ntinually shifts the body so that its CG is over the feet, although in the normal adult\nthis requires no conscious thought. Even as simple a movement as bending over\nrequires moving the hips backward so that the CG remains over the feet, and you\ndo this repositioning without thinking about it. To see this, position yourself with\nyour heels and back to a wall and try to touch your toes. You won't be able to do it\nwithout falling. Persons carrying heavy loads automatically adjust their posture\nso that the CG of the total mass is over their feet, Fig. 9-17.\n240 CHAPTER 9\n", 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': '9-5 Elasticity; Stress and Strain\nIn the first part of this Chapter we studied how to calculate the forces on objects\nin equilibrium. In this Section we study the effects of these forces: any object\nchanges shape under the action of applied forces. If the forces are great enough,\nthe object will break, or fracture, as we will discuss in Section 9-6.\nElasticity and Hooke\'s Law\nIf a force is exerted on an object, such as the vertically suspended metal rod\nshown in Fig. 9-18, the length of the object changes. If the amount of elongation,\nAl, is small compared to the length of the object, experiment shows that Al is\nproportional to the force exerted on the object. This proportionality can be written\nas an equation:\nF = kAl.\n(9-3)\nHere F represents the force pulling on the object, Al is the change in length, and k\nis a proportionality constant. Equation 9-3, which is sometimes called Hooke\'s law+\nafter Robert Hooke (1635-1703), who first noted it, is found to be valid for almost\nany solid material from iron to bone-but it is valid only up to a point. For if the\nforce is too great, the object stretches excessively and eventually breaks.\nFigure 9-19 shows a typical graph of applied force versus elongation. Up to a\npoint called the proportional limit, Eq. 9-3 is a good approximation for many common\nmaterials, and the curve is a straight line. Beyond this point, the graph deviates from\na straight line, and no simple relationship exists between F and Al. Nonetheless,\nup to a point farther along the curve called the elastic limit, the object will return\nto its original length if the applied force is removed. The region from the origin\nto the elastic limit is called the elastic region. If the object is stretched beyond\nthe elastic limit, it enters the plastic region: it does not return to the original length\nupon removal of the external force, but remains permanently deformed (such as\na bent paper clip). The maximum elongation is reached at the breaking point. The\nmaximum force that can be applied without breaking is called the ultimate strength\nof the material (actually, force per unit area, as we discuss in Section 9-6).\n11\nmg\nm\nFIGURE 9-18 Hooke\'s law:\nAl x applied force.\nFIGURE 9-19 Applied force vs.\nelongation for a typical metal under\ntension.\nUltimate strength\n-\nProportional limit\nPlastic region\nForce, F\nYoung\'s Modulus\nThe amount of elongation of an object, such as the rod shown in Fig. 9-18,\ndepends not only on the force applied to it, but also on the material of which it is\nmade and on its dimensions. That is, the constant k in Eq. 9-3 can be written in\nterms of these factors.\nIf we compare rods made of the same material but of different lengths and\ncross-sectional areas, it is found that for the same applied force, the amount of\nstretch (again assumed small compared to the total length) is proportional to the\noriginal length and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. That is,\nthe longer the object, the more it elongates for a given force; and the thicker it is,\nthe less it elongates. These findings can be combined with Eq. 9-3 to yield\nElastic\nlimit\nElastic region\nBreaking\npoint\nElongation, Al\nAl = = + lo,\nE A\n(9-4)\nwhere lo is the original length of the object, A is the cross-sectional area, and Al is the\nchange in length due to the applied force F. E is a constant of proportionality* known\nas the elastic modulus, or Young\'s modulus; its value depends only on the material.\n*The term "law" applied to this relation is historical, but today it is not really appropriate. First of all,\nit is only an approximation, and second, it refers only to a limited set of phenomena. Most physicists\ntoday prefer to reserve the word "law" for those relations that are deeper and more encompassing\nand precise, such as Newton\'s laws of motion or the law of conservation of energy.\n*The fact that E is in the denominator, so 1/E is the actual proportionality constant, is merely a\nconvention. When we rewrite Eq. 9-4 to get Eq. 9-5, E is found in the numerator.\nSECTION 9-5 Elasticity; Stress and Strain 241\n', 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': "The value of Young's modulus for various materials is given in Table 9-1 (the\nshear modulus and bulk modulus in this Table are discussed later in this Section).\nBecause E is a property only of the material and is independent of the object's size\nor shape, Eq. 9-4 is far more useful for practical calculation than Eq. 9-3.\nTABLE 9-1 Elastic Moduli\nMaterial\nE (N/m2)\nG (N/m2)\nB (N/m2)\nSolids\nIron, cast\n100 × 109\n40 × 109\n90 × 109\nSteel\n200 × 109\n80 × 109\n140 × 109\nBrass\n100 × 109\n35 × 109\n80 × 109\nAluminum\n70 × 109\n25 × 109\n70 ×109\nConcrete\n20 × 109\nBrick\n14 × 109\nMarble\n50 × 109\n70 ×109\nGranite\n45 × 109\n45 × 109\nWood (pine) (parallel to grain)\n10 ×109\n(perpendicular to grain)\n1 × 109\nNylon\n~3 × 109\nBone (limb)\n15 × 109\n80 × 109\nLiquids\nWater\n2.0×109\nAlcohol (ethyl)\n1.0× 109\nMercury\n2.5 × 109\nGases+\nAir, H2, He, CO2\n1.01 × 105\n+At normal atmospheric pressure; no variation in temperature during process.\nYoung's Modulus, Shear Modulus, Bulk Modulus,\nEXAMPLE 9-10\nTension in piano wire.

It is general practice to define the force per unit area as the stress:\nstress = force _ F,\nwhich has SI units of N/m2. Also, the strain is defined to be the ratio of the change\nin length to the original length:\nstrain\n=\noriginal length\nchange in length\nlo\n=\n,\nand is dimensionless (no units). Strain is thus the fractional change in length of the\nobject, and is a measure of how much the object has been deformed. Stress is applied\nto the material by external agents, whereas strain is the material's response to the\nstress. Equation 9-4 can be rewritten as\nE = E Al\nla\n(9-5)\nor\nstress\nE =\nF/ A\n=\nAl/10\nstrain\nThus we see that the strain is directly proportional to the stress, in the linear\n(elastic) region of Fig. 9-19.\nTension, Compression, and Shear Stress\nB\nF\nThe rod shown in Fig. 9-20a is said to be under tension or tensile stress. Not only\nis there a force pulling down on the rod at its lower end, but since the rod is in\nequilibrium we know that the support at the top is exerting an equalt upward\nforce on the rod at its upper end, Fig. 9-20a. In fact, this tensile stress exists through-\nout the material. Consider, for example, the lower half of a suspended rod as shown\nin Fig. 9-20b. This lower half is in equilibrium, so there must be an upward force\non it to balance the downward force at its lower end. What exerts this upward\nforce? It must be the upper part of the rod. Thus we see that external forces\napplied to an object give rise to internal forces, or stress, within the material itself.\nStrain or deformation due to tensile stress is but one type of stress to which\nmaterials can be subjected. There are two other common types of stress: compres-\nsive and shear. Compressive stress is the exact opposite of tensile stress. Instead of\nbeing stretched, the material is compressed: the forces act inwardly on the object.\nColumns that support a weight, such as the columns of a Greek temple (Fig. 9-21),\nare subjected to compressive stress. Equations 9-4 and 9-5 apply equally well to\ncompression and tension, and the values for the modulus E are usually the same.\nB\nF\n1\nB\nB\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 9-20 Stress exists within\nthe material.\n+Or a greater force if the weight of the rod cannot be ignored compared to F.\nFIGURE 9-21 This Greek temple, in Agrigento,\nSicily, built 2500 years ago, shows the post-and-beam\nconstruction.

Thus concrete\ncan be used as vertical columns placed under compression, but is of little\nvalue as a beam because it cannot withstand the tensile forces that result\nfrom the inevitable sagging of the lower edge of a beam (see Fig. 9-25).\nFIGURE 9-25 A beam sags, at least\na little (but is exaggerated here), even\nunder its own weight. The beam thus\nchanges shape: the upper edge is\ncompressed, and the lower edge is\nunder tension (elongated).

But the concrete on the lower edge of a loaded beam still tends\nto crack because it is weak under tension. This problem is solved with prestressed\nconcrete, which also contains iron rods or a wire mesh, but during the pouring of\nthe concrete, the rods or wire are held under tension. After the concrete dries,\nthe tension on the iron is released, putting the concrete under compression.\nThe amount of compressive stress is carefully predetermined so that when loads\nare applied to the beam, the compression on the lower edge is never allowed\nto be reduced so far as to put the concrete into tension.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nA tragic collapse\nFIGURE 9-27 Example 9-12.\nA\n(a)\nmg\n(c) Force on pin A\nexerted by\nvertical rod\n(b)\nA\n2mg\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 9-12\nA tragic substitution. Two walkways, one\nabove the other, are suspended from vertical rods attached to the ceiling of a\nhigh hotel lobby, Fig. 9-27a. The original design called for single rods 14 m long,\nbut when such long rods proved to be unwieldy to install, it was decided to replace\neach long rod with two shorter ones as shown schematically in Fig. 9-27b.\nDetermine the net force exerted by the rods on the supporting pin A (assumed to\nbe the same size) for each design. Assume each vertical rod supports a mass m\nof each bridge.\nmg\n(d) Forces on pins\nat A exerted by\nvertical rods\nRESPONSE The single long vertical rod in Fig. 9-27a exerts an upward force\nequal to mg on pin A to support the mass m of the upper bridge. Why? Because\nthe pin is in equilibrium, and the other force that balances this is the downward\nforce mg exerted on it by the upper bridge (Fig. 9-27c). There is thus a shear\nstress on the pin because the rod pulls up on one side of the pin, and the bridge\npulls down on the other side. The situation when two shorter rods support the\nbridges (Fig. 9-27b) is shown in Fig. 9-27d, in which only the connections at\nthe upper bridge are shown. The lower rod exerts a force of mg downward on\nthe lower of the two pins because it supports the lower bridge. The upper rod\nexerts a force of 2mg on the upper pin (labelled A) because the upper rod supports\nboth bridges. Thus we see that when the builders substituted two shorter rods\nfor each single long one, the stress in the supporting pin A was doubled. What\nperhaps seemed like a simple substitution did, in fact, lead to a tragic collapse in\n1981 with a loss of life of over 100 people (see Fig. 9-1). Having a feel for physics,\nand being able to make simple calculations based on physics, can have a great\neffect, literally, on people's lives.\n*9-7 Spanning a Space: Arches and Domes\nThere are a great many areas where the arts and humanities overlap the sciences,\nand this is especially clear in architecture, where the forces in the materials that\nmake up a structure need to be understood to avoid excessive deformation and\ncollapse. Many of the features we admire in the architecture of the past were intro-\nduced not simply for their decorative effect, but for technical reasons. One\nexample is the development of methods to span a space, from the simple beam\nsupported by columns, to arches and domes.\n246 CHAPTER 9 Static Equilibrium; Elasticity and Fracture\n", 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The first important architectural invention was the post-and-beam (or post-\nand-lintel) construction, in which two upright posts or columns support a horizontal\nbeam. Before steel was introduced in the nineteenth century, the length of a beam\nwas quite limited because the strongest building materials were then stone and\nbrick. Hence the width of a span was limited by the size of available stones. Equally\nimportant, stone and brick, though strong under compression-are very weak\nunder tension and shear; all three types of stress occur in a beam (see Fig. 9-25).\nThe minimal space that could be spanned using stone is shown by the closely\nspaced columns of the great Greek temples (Fig. 9-21).\nThe semicircular arch (Figs. 9-28a and b) was introduced by the ancient Romans\n2000 years ago. Aside from its aesthetic appeal, it was a tremendous technolog-\nical innovation. The advantage of the "true" or semicircular arch is that, if well\ndesigned, its wedge-shaped stones experience stress which is mainly compressive\neven when supporting a large load such as the wall and roof of a cathedral.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nArchitecture: beams, arches,\nand domes\nFIGURE 9-28 (a) Round arches in\nthe Roman Forum, 2000 years old.\nThe one in the background is the\nArch of Titus. (b) An arch is used\nhere to good effect for a bridge over\na chasm on the California coast.\n(a)\n(b)\nBecause the stones are forced to squeeze against one another, they are mainly\nunder compression (see Fig. 9-29). A round arch consisting of many well-shaped\nstones could span a very wide space. However, because the arch transfers\nhorizontal as well as vertical forces to the supports, considerable buttressing on\nthe sides is needed, as we discuss shortly.\nFIGURE 9-29 Stones in a\nround arch (see Fig. 9-28a) are\nmainly under compression.\nThe pointed arch came into use about A.D. 1100 and became the hallmark of\nthe great Gothic cathedrals. It too was an important technical innovation, and was\nfirst used to support heavy loads such as the tower and central arch of a cathedral.\nApparently the builders realized that, because of the steepness of the pointed arch,\nthe forces due to the weight above could be brought down more nearly vertically,\nso less horizontal buttressing would be needed. The pointed arch reduced the load on\nthe walls, so there could be more window openings and light. The smaller buttressing\nneeded was provided on the outside by graceful flying buttresses (Fig. 9-30).\nThe technical innovation of the pointed arch was achieved not through calcula-\ntion but through experience and intuition; it was not until much later that detailed\ncalculations, such as those presented earlier in this Chapter, came into use.\nFIGURE 9-30 Flying buttresses\n(on the cathedral of Notre Dame,\nin Paris).\n*SECTION 9-7 Spanning a Space: Arches and Domes 247\n', 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': '2.0 m\n2.0 m\n6.0× 104 N\n6.0×104 N\nFIGURE 9-31 (a) Forces in a\nround arch, compared (b) with\nthose in a pointed arch.\n6.0× 104 N\n6.0×104 N\n8.0 m\n4.0 m\nFy= 6.0× 104 N\nFH\nFy=6.0× 104 N\n+ FH\nFIGURE 9-32 Interior of the\nPantheon in Rome, built almost\n2000 years ago.

Figure 9-31 shows a round arch and a pointed arch, each with an 8.0-m\nspan. The height of the round arch is thus 4.0 m, whereas that of the pointed arch\nis larger and has been chosen to be 8.0 m. Each arch supports a weight of\n12.0 × 104 N (= 12,000 kg × g) which, for simplicity, we have divided into two\nparts (each 6.0 × 104 N) acting on the two halves of each arch as shown. To be in\nequilibrium, each of the supports must exert an upward force of 6.0 × 104 N. For\nrotational equilibrium, each support also exerts a horizontal force, FH, at the\nbase of the arch, and it is this we want to calculate. We focus only on the right half\nof each arch. We set equal to zero the total torque calculated about the apex of\nthe arch due to the three forces exerted on that half arch. The torque equation\n(¿T = 0) contains three terms: the weight above, the support Fy below, and the\nhorizontal force FH, which for the round arch (see Fig. 9-31a) is\n-(2.0 m)(6.0 × 104 N) + (4.0 m)(6.0 × 104 N) - (4.0m)(FH) = 0.\nThus FH = 3.0 X 104 N for the round arch. For the pointed arch, the torque equa-\ntion is (see Fig. 9-31b)\n-(2.0 m)(6.0 × 104 N) + (4.0 m)(6.0 × 104 N) - (8.0m)(FH) = 0.\nSolving, we find that FH = 1.5 X 104 N-only half as much as for the round arch!\nFrom this calculation we can see that the horizontal buttressing force required\nfor a pointed arch is less because the arch is higher, and there is therefore a longer\nlever arm for this force. Indeed, the steeper the arch, the less the horizontal\ncomponent of the force needs to be, and hence the more nearly vertical is the\nforce exerted at the base of the arch.\nWhereas an arch spans a two-dimensional space, a dome-which is basically an\narch rotated about a vertical axis-spans a three-dimensional space. The Romans\nbuilt the first large domes. Their shape was hemispherical and some still stand, such\nas that of the Pantheon in Rome (Fig. 9-32), built nearly 2000 years ago.\nFourteen centuries later, a new cathedral was being built in Florence.+ It was\nto have a dome 43 m in diameter to rival that of the Pantheon, whose construc-\ntion has remained a mystery. The new dome was to rest on a "drum" with no\nexternal abutments. Filippo Brunelleschi (1377-1446) designed a pointed dome\n(Fig. 9-33), since a pointed dome, like a pointed arch, exerts a smaller side thrust\nagainst its base. A dome, like an arch, is not stable until all the stones are in place.\nTo support smaller domes during construction, wooden frameworks were used.\nBut no trees big enough or strong enough could be found to span the 43-m space\nrequired. Brunelleschi built the dome in horizontal layers, each bonded to the\nprevious one, holding it in place until the last stone of the circle was placed. Each\nclosed ring was then strong enough to support the next layer. An amazing feat. Only in\nthe twentieth century were larger domes built.\n*Supervised by Arnolfo di Cambio, who wanted a dome but was unable to design it himself. But he\nwas confident that Florentine genius would find a way, given that the ancient Romans had done it with\nthe Pantheon, which still stands.\n248 CHAPTER 9 Static Equilibrium; Elasticity and Fracture\n', 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 9-13\nA modern dome.

The subject con-\ncerned with the determination of the forces within a structure\nat rest is called statics.\nThe two necessary conditions for an object to be in equi-\nlibrium are (1) the vector sum of all the forces on it must\nbe zero, and (2) the sum of all the torques (calculated about\nany arbitrary axis) must also be zero. For a two-dimensional\nproblem we can write\nΣFx = 0, ΣΕy = 0,\n(9-1,9-2)\nIt is important when doing statics problems to apply the\nequilibrium conditions to only one object at a time.\nΣτ = 0.\nAn object in static equilibrium is said to be in (a) stable,\n(b) unstable, or (c) neutral equilibrium, depending on whether a\nslight displacement leads to (a) a return to the original position,\n(b) further movement away from the original position, or\n(c) rest in the new position. An object in stable equilibrium is\nalso said to be in balance.\nHooke's law applies to many elastic solids, and states\nthat the change in length of an object is proportional to the\napplied force:\nF = kAl.\n(9-3)\nIf the force is too great, the object will exceed its elastic limit,\nwhich means it will no longer return to its original shape when\nthe distorting force is removed. If the force is even greater, the\nultimate strength of the material can be exceeded, and the\nobject will fracture. The force per unit area acting on an object\nis the stress, and the resulting fractional change in length is the\nstrain.\nThe stress on an object is present within the object and\ncan be of three types: compression, tension, or shear. The ratio\nof stress to strain is called the elastic modulus of the material.\nYoung's modulus applies for compression and tension, and the\nshear modulus for shear. Bulk modulus applies to an object\nwhose volume changes as a result of pressure on all sides. All\nthree moduli are constants for a given material when distorted\nwithin the elastic region.\n[*Arches and domes are special ways to span a space that\nallow the stresses to be managed well.]\nSummary 249\n", 'chapter_title': '9-3 Applications to Muscles and Joints'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Questions\n1.
