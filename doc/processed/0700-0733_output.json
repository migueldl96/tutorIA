In our dis-\ncussion of waves in Chapter 11, we noted that energy can be carried from place\nto place in basically two ways: by particles or by waves. In the first case, material\nobjects or particles can carry energy, such as an avalanche of rocks or rushing\nwater. In the second case, water waves and sound waves, for example, can carry\nenergy over long distances even though the oscillating particles of the medium\ndo not travel these distances.

For one thing,\nlight does not reveal itself in any obvious way as being made up of tiny particles;\nnor do we see tiny light waves passing by as we do water waves. The evidence\nseemed to favor first one side and then the other until about 1830, when most\nphysicists had accepted the wave theory. By the end of the nineteenth century,\nlight was considered to be an electromagnetic wave (Chapter 22). In the early twen-\ntieth century, light was shown to have a particle nature as well, as we shall discuss\nin Chapter 27. We now speak of the wave-particle duality of light. The wave theory\nof light remains valid and has proved very successful. In this Chapter we investi-\ngate the evidence for the wave theory and how it has been used to explain a wide\nrange of phenomena.\n24-1 Waves vs. Particles;\nHuygens\' Principle and Diffraction\nThe Dutch scientist Christian Huygens (1629-1695), a contemporary of Newton,\nproposed a wave theory of light that had much merit. Still useful today is a\ntechnique Huygens developed for predicting the future position of a wave front\nwhen an earlier position is known. By a wave front, we mean all the points along\na two- or three-dimensional wave that form a wave crest-what we simply call a\n"wave" as seen on the ocean. Wave fronts are perpendicular to rays as discussed\nin Chapter 11 (Fig. 11-35). Huygens\' principle can be stated as follows: Every\npoint on a wave front can be considered as a source of tiny wavelets that spread\nout in the forward direction at the speed of the wave itself. The new wave front is\nthe envelope of all the wavelets-that is, the tangent to all of them.\nAs an example of the use of Huygens\' principle, consider the wave front AB\nin Fig. 24-1, which is traveling away from a source S. We assume the medium is\nisotropic-that is, the speed v of the waves is the same in all directions. To find\nthe wave front a short time t after it is at AB, tiny circles are drawn at points\nalong AB with radius r = vt. The centers of these tiny circles are shown as blue\ndots on the original wave front AB, and the circles represent Huygens\' (imaginary)\nwavelets. The tangent to all these wavelets, the curved line CD, is the new\nposition of the wave front after a time t.\nHuygens\' principle is particularly useful for analyzing what happens when\nwaves run into an obstacle and the wave fronts are partially interrupted.\nHuygens\' principle predicts that waves bend in behind an obstacle, as shown in\nFig. 24-2. This is just what water waves do, as we saw in Chapter 11 (Figs. 11-45\nand 11-46). The bending of waves behind obstacles into the "shadow region" is\nknown as diffraction. Since diffraction occurs for waves, but not for particles, it\ncan serve as one means for distinguishing the nature of light.\nNote, as shown in Fig. 24-2, that diffraction is most prominent when the size\nof the opening is on the order of the wavelength of the wave. If the opening is\nmuch larger than the wavelength, diffraction may go unnoticed.\nDoes light exhibit diffraction? In the mid-seventeenth century, the Jesuit\npriest Francesco Grimaldi (1618-1663) had observed that when sunlight entered\na darkened room through a tiny hole in a screen, the spot on the opposite wall\nwas larger than would be expected from geometric rays. He also observed that\nthe border of the image was not clear but was surrounded by colored fringes.\nGrimaldi attributed this to the diffraction of light.\nThe wave model of light nicely accounts for diffraction. But the ray model\n(Chapter 23) cannot account for diffraction, and it is important to be aware of such\nlimitations to the ray model. Geometric optics using rays is successful in a wide\nrange of situations only because normal openings and obstacles are much larger\nthan the wavelength of the light, and so relatively little diffraction or bending\noccurs.\n680 CHAPTER 24 The Wave Nature of Light\n', 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': "*\n24-2 Huygens' Principle and the\nLaw of Refraction\nThe laws of reflection and refraction were well known in Newton's time. The law\nof reflection could not distinguish between the two theories we just discussed:\nwaves versus particles. When waves reflect from an obstacle, the angle of incidence\nequals the angle of reflection (Fig. 11-36). The same is true of particles-think\nof a tennis ball without spin striking a flat surface.\nThe law of refraction is another matter. Consider a ray of light entering a\nmedium where it is bent toward the normal, as when traveling from air into water.\nAs shown in Fig. 24-3, this bending can be constructed using Huygens' principle if\nwe assume the speed of light is less in the second medium (v2 < v1). In time t,\npoint B on wave front AB (perpendicular to the incoming ray) travels a distance v1t\nto reach point D. Point A on the wave front, traveling in the second medium, goes\na distance V2t to reach point C, and V2t < vit. Huygens' principle is applied to\npoints A and B to obtain the curved wavelets shown at C and D. The wave front is\ntangent to these two wavelets, so the new wave front is the line CD. Hence the rays,\nwhich are perpendicular to the wave fronts, bend toward the normal if U2 < 21,\nas drawn. (This is basically the same discussion as we used around Fig. 11-42.)\nNewton favored a particle theory of light which predicted the opposite result,\nthat the speed of light would be greater in the second medium (22 > v1). Thus the\nwave theory predicts that the speed of light in water, for example, is less than in air;\nand Newton's particle theory predicts the reverse. An experiment to actually meas-\nure the speed of light in water was performed in 1850 by the French physicist Jean\nFoucault, and it confirmed the wave-theory prediction. By then, however, the wave\ntheory was already fully accepted, as we shall see in the next Section.\nSnell's law of refraction follows directly from Huygens' principle, given that\nthe speed of light v in any medium is related to the speed in a vacuum, c, and the\nindex of refraction, n, by Eq. 23-4: that is, v = c/n. From the Huygens' con-\nstruction of Fig. 24-3, angle ADC is equal to 02 and angle BAD is equal to 01 . Then\nfor the two triangles that have the common side AD, we have\nUt\nU2t\nsin 01 =-\nAD'\nsin 02 =\nAD\nsin 01\n= 01.\n22\nWe divide these two equations and obtain\nsin 02\nThen, by Eq. 23-4, v1 = c/n1 and V2 = c/n2, so we have\nn1 sin 01 = n2 sin 02,\nwhich is Snell's law of refraction, Eq. 23-5. (The law of reflection can be derived\nfrom Huygens' principle in a similar way.)\nWhen a light wave travels from one medium to another, its frequency does not\nchange, but its wavelength does. This can be seen from Fig. 24-3, where each of the\nblue lines representing a wave front corresponds to a crest (peak) of the wave. Then\n12 = ost\nλι\nut\nunt = 2 = 7 ,\nwhere, in the last step, we used Eq. 23-4, v = c/n. If medium 1 is a vacuum (or\nair), so n1 = 1, 01 = c, and we call À1 simply À, then the wavelength in another\nmedium of index of refraction n (= n2) will be\nAn = 1.\n(24-1)\nThis result is consistent with the frequency f being unchanged no matter what\nmedium the wave is traveling in, since c = fÀ.\nEXERCISE A A light beam in air with wavelength = 500 nm, frequency = 6.0× 1014 Hz,\nand speed = 3.0 × 108 m/s goes into glass which has an index of refraction = 1.5.

For example, on a hot day motorists sometimes see a mirage of water on\nthe highway ahead of them, with distant vehicles seemingly reflected in it\n(Fig. 24-4a). On a hot day, there can be a layer of very hot air next to the roadway\n(made hot by the Sun beating down on the road). Hot air is less dense than\ncooler air, so the index of refraction is slightly lower in the hot air. In Fig. 24-4b,\nwe see a diagram of light coming from one point on a distant car (on the right)\nheading left toward the observer. Wave fronts and two rays (perpendicular to the\nwave fronts) are shown. Ray A heads directly at the observer and follows a\nstraight-line path, and represents the normal view of the distant car. Ray B is a\nray initially directed slightly downward but, instead of hitting the road, it bends\nslightly as it moves through layers of air of different index of refraction. The wave\nfronts, shown in blue in Fig. 24-4b, move slightly faster in the layers of (less dense)\nair nearer the ground. Thus ray B is bent as shown, and seems to the observer to\nbe coming from below (dashed line) as if reflected off the road. Hence the mirage.\n24-3 Interference-Young\'s\nDouble-Slit Experiment\nIn 1801, the Englishman Thomas Young (1773-1829) obtained convincing evidence\nfor the wave nature of light and was even able to measure wavelengths for visible\nlight. Figure 24-5a shows a schematic diagram of Young\'s famous double-slit\nexperiment. To have light from a single source, Young used the sunlight passing\nthrough a very narrow slit in a window covering. This beam of parallel rays falls\non a screen containing two closely spaced slits, S1 and S2 . (The slits and their sepa-\nration are very narrow, not much larger than the wavelength of the light.) If light\nconsists of tiny particles, we would expect to see two bright lines on a screen placed\nbehind the slits as in (b). But instead, a series of bright lines are seen as in (c).\nYoung was able to explain this result as a wave-interference phenomenon.\nTo understand why, consider plane wavest of light of a single wavelength-\ncalled monochromatic, meaning "one color"-falling on the two slits as shown in\nFig. 24-6. Because of diffraction, the waves leaving the two small slits spread out\nas shown. This is equivalent to the interference pattern produced when two rocks\nare thrown into a lake (Fig. 11-38), or when sound from two loudspeakers inter-\nferes (Fig. 12-16). Recall Section 11-11 on wave interference.\n*See pages 312 and 628.\nRays\nS\nWave fronts\nS\nFIGURE 24-6 Plane waves\n(parallel flat wave fronts) fall on\ntwo slits.

[Assume & > d.]\n(b) At this angle 0, the lower wave travels an extra distance of one whole wavelength, and the waves\nare in phase; note from the shaded triangle that the path difference equals d sin 0. (c) For this angle 0,\nthe lower wave travels an extra distance equal to one-half wavelength, so the two waves arrive at the\nscreen fully out of phase. (d) A more detailed diagram showing the geometry for parts (b) and (c).\nTo see how an interference pattern is produced on the screen, we make use\nof Fig. 24-7. Waves of wavelength À are shown entering the slits S1 and S2, which\nare a distance d apart. The waves spread out in all directions after passing through\nthe slits (Fig. 24-6), but they are shown in Figs. 24-7a, b, and c only for three dif-\nferent angles 0. In Fig. 24-7a, the waves reaching the center of the screen are shown\n(0 = 0°). Waves from the two slits travel the same distance, so they are in phase:\na crest of one wave arrives at the same time as a crest of the other wave.\nHence the amplitudes of the two waves add to form a larger amplitude as shown\nin Fig. 24-8a. This is constructive interference, and there is a bright line at the\ncenter of the screen. Constructive interference also occurs when the paths of the\ntwo rays differ by one wavelength (or any whole number of wavelengths), as shown\nin Fig. 24-7b; also here there will be a bright line on the screen. But if one ray travels\nan extra distance of one-half wavelength (or 3A, A, and so on), the two waves\nare exactly out of phase (Section 11-11) when they reach the screen: the crests of\none wave arrive at the same time as the troughs of the other wave, and so they\nadd to produce zero amplitude (Fig. 24-8b). This is destructive interference, and\nthe screen is dark, Fig. 24-7c. Thus, there will be a series of bright and dark lines\n(or fringes) on the viewing screen.\nTo determine exactly where the bright lines fall, first note that Fig. 24-7 is\nsomewhat exaggerated; in real situations, the distance d between the slits is very\nsmall compared to the distance & to the screen. The rays from each slit for each\ncase will therefore be essentially parallel, and 0 is the angle they make with the\nhorizontal as shown in Fig. 24-7d. From the shaded right triangles shown in\nFigs. 24-7b and c, we can see that the extra distance traveled by the lower ray is\nd sin 0 (seen more clearly in Fig. 24-7d).

The distance between the first two fringes (say) can be\nfound using right triangles as shown in Fig. 24-10.\nSOLUTION Given d = 0.100 mm = 1.00 × 10-4m, À=500×10-9m, and\n( = 1.20 m, the first-order fringe (m = 1) occurs at an angle 0 given by\nsin 01 = mx = (1) (500 × 10-9 m)\n1.00 × 10-4 m\n= 5.00×10-3.\nThis is a very small angle, so we can take sin 0 ~ 0, with 0 in radians. The first-\norder fringe will occur a distance x1 above the center of the screen (see\nFig. 24-10), given by x1/l = tan 01 ~ 01, so\nX1 ~ 201 = (1.20 m) (5.00 × 10-3) = 6.00 mm.\nThe second-order fringe (m = 2) will occur at\nx2 ~ CO2 = 12 = 12.0 mm\nabove the center, and so on.

(b) What happens\ninstead if the wavelength stays at 500 nm but the slits are moved farther apart?\nRESPONSE (a) When À increases in Eq. 24-2a but d stays the same, the angle 0\nfor bright fringes increases and the interference pattern spreads out. (b) Increasing\nthe slit spacing d reduces 0 for each order, so the lines are closer together.\nFrom Eqs. 24-2 we can see that, except for the zeroth-order fringe at the\ncenter, the position of the fringes depends on wavelength. When white light falls\non the two slits, as Young found in his experiments, the central fringe is white, but\nthe first (and higher) order fringes contain a spectrum of colors like a rainbow.\n684 CHAPTER 24\n', 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Using Eq. 24-2a, we can see that 0 is smallest for violet light and largest for red\n(Fig. 24-11). By measuring the position of these fringes, Young was the first to\ndetermine the wavelengths of visible light. In doing so, he showed that what\ndistinguishes different colors physically is their wavelength (or frequency), an\nidea put forward earlier by Grimaldi in 1665.\nEXAMPLE 24-3\nWavelengths from double-slit interference. White light\npasses through two slits 0.50 mm apart, and an interference pattern is observed\non a screen 2.5 m away. The first-order fringe resembles a rainbow with violet\nand red light at opposite ends. The violet light is about 2.0 mm and the red 3.5 mm\nfrom the center of the central white fringe (Fig. 24-11).

This happens because the waves come from a single source to the left\nof the two slits. An interference pattern is observed only when the sources are\ncoherent. If two tiny lightbulbs replaced the two slits, an interference pattern\nwould not be seen. The light emitted by one lightbulb would have a random\nphase with respect to the second bulb, and the screen would be more or less uni-\nformly illuminated. Two such sources, whose output waves have phases that bear\nno fixed relationship to each other over time, are called incoherent sources.\n24-4 The Visible Spectrum and Dispersion\nTwo of the most important properties of light are readily describable in terms of the\nwave theory of light: intensity (or brightness) and color. The intensity of light is the\nenergy it carries per unit area per unit time, and is related to the square of the ampli-\ntude of the wave, as for any wave (see Section 11-9, or Eqs. 22-7 and 22-8). The\ncolor of light is related to the frequency f or wavelength À of the light. (Recall\nÀf=c= 3.0 × 108 m/s, Eq. 22-4.)

White light is a mixture of all visible\nwavelengths, and when incident on a prism, as in Fig. 24-15, the different wave-\nlengths are bent to varying degrees. Because the index of refraction is greater for\nthe shorter wavelengths, violet light is bent the most and red the least, as shown in\nFig. 24-15. This spreading of white light into the full spectrum is called dispersion.\nRainbows are a spectacular example of dispersion-by drops of water. You can\nsee rainbows when you look at falling water droplets with the Sun behind you.\nFigure 24-16 shows how red and violet rays are bent by spherical water droplets\nand are reflected off the back surface of the droplet. Red is bent the least and so\nreaches the observer's eyes from droplets higher in the sky, as shown in Fig. 24-16a.\nThus the top of the rainbow is red.\nFIGURE 24-16 (a) Ray diagram showing how a rainbow (b) is formed.\nThese two rays\nare seen by\nobserver (not\nto scale)\nRed\nViolet\nFIGURE 24-17 Diamond.\nSunlight\nRed\nOrange\nViolet\nYellow\nGreen\nBlue\nSunlight\nViolet\nRed\n(a)\n(b)\nDiamonds achieve their brilliance (Fig. 24-17) from a combination of disper-\nsion and total internal reflection. Because diamonds have a very high index of\nrefraction of about 2.4, the critical angle for total internal reflection is only 25°.\nThe light dispersed into a spectrum inside the diamond therefore strikes many of\nthe internal surfaces of the diamond before it strikes one at less than 25° and\nemerges. After many such reflections, the light has traveled far enough that the\ncolors have become sufficiently separated to be seen individually and brilliantly\nby the eye after leaving the diamond.\nThe visible spectrum, Fig. 24-12, does not show all the colors seen in nature.\nFor example, there is no brown in Fig. 24-12. Many of the colors we see are\na mixture of wavelengths. For practical purposes, most natural colors can be\nreproduced using three primary colors. They are red, green, and blue for direct\nsource viewing such as TV and computer monitors. For inks used in printing, the\nprimary colors are cyan (the blue color of the margin notes in this book), yellow,\nand magenta (the pinkish red color we use for light rays in ray diagrams).\n*The complete electromagnetic spectrum is illustrated in Fig. 22-8.\n686 CHAPTER 24\n", 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': "CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 24-4\nObserved color of light under water. We\nsaid that color depends on wavelength. For example, light of wavelength\nÀo = 650 nm in air, we see red. If we observe the same object when under\nwater, it still looks red. But the wavelength in water Àw is (Eq. 24-1)\nÀw = \\o/nw = 650 nm/1.33 = 489 nm. Light with wavelength 489 nm in air\nwould appear blue in air. Can you explain why the light appears red rather than\nblue when observed under water?\nRESPONSE Today we have little doubt that it is our brains that express colors,\nbased on the wavelengths of light that strike the receptor cells within the retina\n(at the rear of the eyeball, as diagrammed in the next Chapter, Fig. 25-9). For\nobjects under water, the water does nothing to change the frequency, but does\nchange the wavelength to Ào/nw. When that light enters the eye, the frequency\nis still unchanged, but the speed is changed to c/neye where neye is the index of\nrefraction of the fluid that fills the interior of the eye and is in contact with the\nretina. The wavelength of light that reaches the retina is Àeye = Ào/neye, and is\nthe same whether the light enters from the air or from water.\n24-5 Diffraction by a Single Slit or Disk\nYoung's double-slit experiment put the wave theory of light on a firm footing.\nBut full acceptance came only with studies on diffraction (Section 24-1) more\nthan a decade later, in the 1810s and 1820s.\nWe have already discussed diffraction briefly with regard to water waves\n(Section 11-14) as well as for light (Section 24-1). We have seen that diffraction\nrefers to the spreading or bending of waves around edges. Let's look in more detail.\nIn 1819 Augustin Fresnel (1788-1827) presented to the French Academy a\nwave theory of light that predicted and explained interference and diffraction\neffects. Almost immediately Siméon Poisson (1781-1840) pointed out a counter-\nintuitive inference: according to Fresnel's wave theory, if light from a point source\nwere to fall on a solid disk, part of the incident light would be diffracted around the\nedges and would constructively interfere at the center of the shadow (Fig. 24-18).\nThat prediction seemed very unlikely. But when the experiment was actually carried\nout by Francois Arago, the bright spot was seen at the very center of the shadow\n(Fig. 24-19a). This was strong evidence for the wave theory.\nFigure 24-19a is a photograph of the shadow cast by a coin using a coherent\npoint source of light, a laser in this case. The bright spot is clearly present at the\ncenter. Note also the bright and dark fringes beyond the shadow. These resemble\nthe interference fringes of a double slit. Indeed, they are due to interference of\nwaves diffracted around the outer edge of the disk, and the group of fringes is\nreferred to as a diffraction pattern. A diffraction pattern exists around any sharp-\nedged object illuminated by a point source, as shown in Figs. 24-19b and c. We\nare not always aware of diffraction because most sources of light in everyday life\nare not points, so light from different parts of the source washes out the pattern.\n(a)\n(b)\nShadow\nSolid\ndisk\nBright\nspot\nFIGURE 24-18 If light is a wave,\na bright spot will appear at the center\nof the shadow of a solid disk\nilluminated by a point source of\nmonochromatic light.\nFIGURE 24-19 Diffraction pattern\nof (a) a circular disk (a coin),\n(b) scissors, (c) a single slit, each\nilluminated by a (nearly) point source\nof coherent monochromatic light.\n(c)\n687\n", 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': "To see how a diffraction pattern arises, we analyze the important case of\nmonochromatic light passing through a narrow slit (as for Fig. 24-19c).

The slit width D is on the order of the wavelength À of the light, but\nthe slit's length (into and out of page) may be large compared to À. The light falls\non a screen which is assumed to be very far away, so the rays heading toward any\npoint are very nearly parallel before they meet at the screen. First we consider\nrays that pass straight through as in Fig. 24-20a. They are all in phase, so there\nwill be a central bright spot on the screen (see Fig. 24-19c). In Fig. 24-20b, we\nconsider rays moving at an angle 0 such that the ray from the top of the slit travels\nexactly one wavelength farther than the ray from the bottom edge to reach the\nscreen. The ray passing through the very center of the slit will travel one-half\nwavelength farther than the ray at the bottom of the slit. These two rays will be\nexactly out of phase with one another and so will destructively interfere when\nthey overlap at the screen. Similarly, a ray slightly above the bottom one will cancel\na ray that is the same distance above the central one. Indeed, each ray passing\nthrough the lower half of the slit will cancel with a corresponding ray passing\nthrough the upper half. Thus, all the rays destructively interfere in pairs, and so\nthe light intensity will be zero on the viewing screen at this angle. The angle 0 at\nwhich this takes place can be seen from Fig. 24-20b to occur when À = D sin 0, so\nsine = A .\n[first minimum] (24-3a)\nThe light intensity is a maximum at 0 = 0° and decreases to a minimum\n(intensity = zero) at the angle 0 given by Eq. 24-3a.\nNow consider a larger angle 0 such that the top ray travels 2 À farther than the\nbottom ray, as in Fig. 24-20c. In this case, the rays from the bottom third of the\nslit will cancel in pairs with those in the middle third because they will be À/2 out\nof phase. However, light from the top third of the slit will still reach the screen,\nso there will be a bright spot (or fringe) centered near sin 0 ~ 31/2D, but it will\nnot be nearly as bright as the central spot at 0 = 0°. For an even larger angle 0\nsuch that the top ray travels 2\\ farther than the bottom ray, Fig. 24-20d, rays\nfrom the bottom quarter of the slit will cancel with those in the quarter just\nabove it because the path lengths differ by À/2. And the rays through the quarter\nof the slit just above center will cancel with those through the top quarter. At this\nangle there will again be a minimum of zero intensity in the diffraction pattern.\n*If the viewing screen is not far away, lenses can be used to make the rays parallel.\n688 CHAPTER 24 The Wave Nature of Light\n", 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Intensity\nFIGURE 24-21 Intensity in the diffraction\npattern of a single slit as a function of sin 0.\nNote that the central maximum is not only\nmuch higher than the maxima to each side, but\nit is also twice as wide (2)/D wide) as any of\nthe others (each only )/ D wide).\n쯤 쯤 즘 이 즘 쯤 끔\nsin 0\nA plot of the intensity as a function of angle is shown in Fig. 24-21.

Gratings can\nbe made by precision machining of very fine parallel lines on a glass plate. The\nuntouched spaces between the lines serve as the slits. Photographic transparen-\ncies of an original grating serve as inexpensive gratings. Gratings containing\n10,000 lines or slits per centimeter are common, and are very useful for precise\nmeasurements of wavelengths. A diffraction grating containing slits is called a\ntransmission grating. Another type of diffraction grating is the reflection grating,\nmade by ruling fine lines on a metallic or glass surface from which light is reflected\nand analyzed. The analysis is basically the same as for a transmission grating, which\nwe now discuss.\nThe analysis of a diffraction grating is much like that of Young\'s double-slit\nexperiment. We assume parallel rays of light are incident on the grating as shown\nin Fig. 24-24. We also assume that the slits are narrow enough so that diffraction\nby each of them spreads light over a very wide angle on a distant screen beyond\nthe grating, and interference can occur with light from all the other slits. Light rays\nthat pass through each slit without deviation (0 = 0°) interfere constructively\nto produce a bright maximum at the center of the screen. Constructive interfer-\nence also occurs at an angle 0 such that rays from adjacent slits travel an extra\ndistance of Al = mì, where m is an integer. If d is the distance between slits,\nthen we see from Fig. 24-24 that Al = d sin 0, and\nsin e = ma ,\ndiffraction grating\nprincipal maxima\nm = 0, 1, 2, ...\nd\n(24-4)\nis the criterion to have a brightness maximum. This is the same equation as for\nthe double-slit situation, and again m is called the order of the pattern.\nThere is an important difference between a double-slit and a multiple-slit\npattern. The bright maxima are much sharper and narrower for a grating. Why?\nSuppose the angle 0 in Fig. 24-24 is increased just slightly beyond 0 required\nfor a maximum. For only two slits, the two waves will be only slightly out of\nphase, so nearly full constructive interference occurs. This means the maxima are\nwide (see Fig. 24-9). For a grating, the waves from two adjacent slits will also\nnot be significantly out of phase. But waves from one slit and those from a\nsecond one a few hundred slits away may be exactly out of phase; all or nearly\nall the light can cancel in pairs in this way. For example, suppose the angle 0\nis very slightly different from its first-order maximum, so that the extra path\nlength for a pair of adjacent slits is not exactly À but rather 1.0010). The wave\nthrough one slit and another one 500 slits below will have a path difference of\n1) + (500)(0.0010A) = 1.5000A, or 1 2 wavelengths, so the two will be out of phase\nand cancel. A pair of slits, one below each of these, will also cancel. That is, the\nlight from slit 1 cancels with light from slit 501; light from slit 2 cancels with light\nfrom slit 502, and so on. Thus even for a tiny anglet corresponding to an extra path\nlength of 1000 À, there is much destructive interference, and so the maxima of a\ndiffraction grating are very narrow. The more slits there are in a grating, the sharper\nwill be the peaks (see Fig. 24-25). Because a grating produces much sharper\nmaxima than two slits alone, and also much brighter maxima because there are\nmany more slits, a grating is a far more precise device for measuring wavelengths.\nSuppose the light striking a diffraction grating is not monochromatic, but con-\nsists of two or more distinct wavelengths. Then for all orders other than m = 0,\neach wavelength will produce a maximum at a different angle (Eq. 24-4), forming\na line on the screen as shown in Fig. 24-26a.\n*Depending on the total number of slits, there may or may not be complete cancellation for such an\nangle, so there will be very tiny peaks between the main maxima (see Fig. 24-25b), but they are usually\nmuch too small to be seen.\n690 CHAPTER 24 The Wave Nature of Light\n', 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'm=2\nm=2m=1 m=1\nm= 0\nm=1m=1m=2\nm=2\n700\nnm\n400 700\nnm nm\n400\nnm\nm =2\nm=1\nm = 0\nBoth À\n(a)\n400\nnm\nnm nm\nnm\n700 400\n700\nm=1\nm=2\nFIGURE 24-26 Spectra produced by\na grating: (a) two wavelengths, 400 nm and\n700 nm; (b) white light.

Light from a source passes through a narrow slit S in the "collimator."\nThe slit is at the focal point of the lens L, so parallel light falls on the grating. The\nmovable telescope can bring the rays to a focus. Nothing will be seen in the viewing\ntelescope unless it is positioned at an angle 0 that corresponds to a diffraction peak\n(first order is usually used) of a wavelength emitted by the source. The angle 0 can be\nmeasured to very high accuracy, so the wavelength can be determined to high accuracy\nusing Eq. 24-4:\nm\n1 = M\n- sin 0,\nwhere m is an integer representing the order, and d is the distance between grating\nslits. The bright line you see in a spectrometer corresponding to a discrete particular\nwavelength is actually an image of the slit S. A narrower slit results in dimmer light, but\nwe can measure the angular position more precisely. If the light contains a continu-\nous range of wavelengths, then a continuous spectrum is seen in the spectroscope.\nThe spectrometer in Fig. 24-27 uses a transmission grating. Others may use a\nreflection grating, or sometimes a prism. A prism works because of dispersion\n(Section 24-4), bending light of different wavelengths into different angles. A prism\nis not a linear device and must be calibrated because À is not o sin 0; see Fig. 24-14.\nAn important use of a spectrometer is for the identification of atoms or\nmolecules. When a gas is heated or an electric current is passed through it, the gas\nemits a characteristic line spectrum. That is, only certain discrete wavelengths of\nlight are emitted, and these are different for different elements and compounds.+\nFigure 24-28 shows the line spectra for a number of elements in the gas state.\nLine spectra occur only for gases at high temperatures and low pressure and\ndensity. The light from heated solids, such as a lightbulb filament, and even from\na dense gaseous object such as the Sun, produces a continuous spectrum including\na wide range of wavelengths.\nFigure 24-28 also shows the Sun\'s "continuous spectrum," which contains a num-\nber of dark lines (only the most prominent are shown), called absorption lines. Atoms\nand molecules can absorb light at the same wavelengths at which they emit light.\n+Why atoms and molecules emit line spectra was a great mystery for many years and played a central\nrole in the development of modern quantum theory, as we shall see in Chapter 27.\n692 CHAPTER 24 The Wave Nature of Light\n', 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': "The Sun's absorption lines are due to absorption by atoms and molecules in the\ncooler outer atmosphere of the Sun, as well as by atoms and molecules in the\nEarth's atmosphere. A careful analysis of all the Sun's thousands of absorption\nlines reveals that at least two-thirds of all elements are present in the Sun's\natmosphere. The presence of elements in the atmosphere of nearby planets, in\ninterstellar space, and in stars, is also determined by spectroscopy.\nSpectroscopy is useful for determining the presence of certain types of\nmolecules in laboratory specimens where chemical analysis would be difficult. For\nexample, biological DNA and different types of protein absorb light in particular\nregions of the spectrum (such as in the UV). The material to be examined, which\nis often in solution, is placed in a monochromatic light beam whose wavelength is\nselected by the placement angle of a diffraction grating or prism. The amount of\nabsorption, as compared to a standard solution without the specimen, can reveal\nnot only the presence of a particular type of molecule, but also its concentration.\nLight emission and absorption also occur outside the visible part of the\nspectrum, such as in the UV and IR regions. Glass absorbs light in these regions, so\nreflection gratings and mirrors (in place of lenses) are used. Special types of film\nor sensors are used for detection.\nEXAMPLE 24-9\nHydrogen spectrum. Light emitted by hot hydrogen gas is\nobserved with a spectroscope using a diffraction grating having 1.00 × 104 slits/cm.\nThe spectral lines nearest to the center (0°) are a violet line at 24.2°, a blue line\nat 25.7°, a blue-green line at 29.1°, and a red line at 41.0° from the center. What\nare the wavelengths of these spectral lines of hydrogen?\nAPPROACH We get the wavelengths from the angles by using À = (d/m) sin 0\nwhere d is the spacing between slits, and m is the order of the spectrum (Eq. 24-4).\nSOLUTION Since these are the closest lines to 0 = 0°, this is the first-order\nspectrum (m = 1). The slit spacing is d = 1/(1.00 × 104 cm-1) = 1.00 × 10-6m.\nThe wavelength of the violet line is\nl =\n(a) sin e = (1.00 X 10-6 m)\n1\nsin 24.2° = 4.10 × 10-7m = 410 nm.\nThe other wavelengths are:\nblue:\nÀ = (1.00 × 10-6 m) sin 25.7° = 434 nm,\nblue-green:\nÀ = (1.00 × 10-6 m) sin 29.1°\n= 486 nm,\nred:\nÀ = (1.00 × 10-6 m) sin 41.0° = 656 nm.\nNOTE In an unknown mixture of gases, these four spectral lines need to be\nseen to identify that the mixture contains hydrogen.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nChemical and biochemical analysis\nby spectroscopy\n24-8 Interference in Thin Films\nInterference of light gives rise to many everyday phenomena such as the bright\ncolors reflected from soap bubbles and from thin oil or gasoline films on water,\nFig. 24-29. In these and other cases, the colors are a result of constructive interfer-\nence between light reflected from the two surfaces of the thin film. The effect is\nobserved only if the thickness of the film is on the order of the wavelength of the light.\nIf the film thickness is greater than a few wavelengths, the effect gets washed out.\nFIGURE 24-29 Thin-film\ninterference patterns seen in\n(a) a soap bubble, (b) a thin film of\nsoapy water, and (c) a thin layer of\noil on wet pavement.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n693\n", 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': "AVIC\nB\nAir\nOil\nWater\nFIGURE 24-30 Light reflected from\nthe upper and lower surfaces of a\nthin film of oil lying on water.\nTo see how this thin-film interference happens, consider a smooth surface of\nwater on top of which is a thin uniform layer of another substance, say an oil whose\nindex of refraction is less than that of water (we'll see why we assume this shortly);\nsee Fig. 24-30. Assume for now that the incident light is of a single wavelength.\nPart of the incident light is reflected at A on the top surface, and part of the light\ntransmitted is reflected at B on the lower surface. The part reflected at the lower\nsurface must travel the extra distance ABC. If this path difference ABC equals one\nor a whole number of wavelengths in the film (An), the two waves will reach the\neye in phase and interfere constructively. Hence the region AC on the surface\nfilm will appear bright. But if ABC equals An, , and so on, the two waves\nwill be exactly out of phase and destructive interference occurs: the area AC\non the film will show no reflection-it will be dark (transparent to the dark\nmaterial below). The wavelength An is the wavelength in the film: \\n = >/n,\nwhere n is the index of refraction in the film and À is the wavelength in vacuum.\nSee Eq. 24-1.\nWhen white light falls on such a film, the path difference ABC will equal An\n(or mần, with m = an integer) for only one wavelength at a given viewing angle.\nThe color corresponding to À (à in air) will be seen as very bright. For light viewed\nat a slightly different angle, the path difference ABC will be longer or shorter\nand a different color will undergo constructive interference. Thus, for an extended\n(nonpoint) source emitting white light, a series of bright colors will be seen next\nto one another. Variations in thickness of the film will also alter the path differ-\nence ABC and therefore affect the color of light that is most strongly reflected.\nEXERCISE E Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 679, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nWhen a curved glass surface is placed in contact with a flat glass surface,\nFig. 24-31, a series of concentric rings is seen when illuminated from above\nby either white light (as shown) or by monochromatic light. These are called\nNewton's rings and they are due to interference between waves reflected by the\ntop and bottom surfaces of the very thin air gap between the two pieces of glass.\nBecause this gap (which is equivalent to a thin film) increases in width from the\ncentral contact point out to the edges, the extra path length for the lower ray\n(equal to BCD) varies. Where it equals 0, 2 1, 1, 21, 2), and so on, it corresponds\nto constructive and destructive interference; and this gives rise to the series of bright\ncolored circles seen in Fig. 24-31b. The color you see at a given radius corresponds\nto constructive interference; at that radius, other colors partially or fully destruc-\ntively interfere. (If monochromatic light is used, the rings are alternately bright\nand dark.)\nThe point of contact of the two glass surfaces (A in Fig. 24-31a) is not bright\nin Fig. 24-31b. Since the path difference is zero here, our previous analysis would\nsuggest that the waves reflected from each surface are in phase-so this central area\nought to be bright. But it is dark, which tells us the two waves must be completely\n*Although Newton gave an elaborate description of them, they had been first observed and described\nby his contemporary, Robert Hooke.\nFIGURE 24-31 Newton's rings.\n(a) Light rays reflected from upper\nand lower surfaces of the thin air\ngap can interfere.

This can happen only if one of the waves, upon reflection, flips\nover-a crest becomes a trough-see Fig. 24-32. We say that the reflected wave\nhas undergone a phase shift of 180°, or of half a wave cycle (2A). Indeed, this\nand other experiments reveal that, at normal incidence,\na beam of light, reflected by a material with index of refraction greater than\nthat of the material in which it is traveling, changes phase by 180° or ¿ cycle;\nsee Fig. 24-32. This phase shift acts just like a path difference of 21. If the\nindex of refraction of the reflecting material is less than that of the material in\nwhich the light is traveling, no phase shift occurs.+\nThus the wave reflected at the curved surface above the air gap in Fig. 24-31a\nundergoes no change in phase. But the wave reflected at the lower surface, where\nthe beam in air strikes the glass, undergoes a 2-cycle phase shift, equivalent to\na ¿ A path difference. Thus the two waves reflected near the point of contact A of\nthe two glass surfaces (where the air gap approaches zero thickness) will be a half\ncycle (or 180°) out of phase, and a dark spot occurs. Bright colored rings will occur\nwhen the path difference is 21, 21, and so on, because the phase shift at one\nsurface effectively adds a path difference of 2 1 (= 2cycle). (If monochromatic\nlight is used, the bright Newton\'s rings will be separated by dark bands which\noccur when the path difference BCD in Fig. 24-31a is equal to an integral number\nof wavelengths.)\nReturning for a moment to Fig. 24-30, the light reflecting at both interfaces,\nair-oil and oil-water, each underwent a phase shift of 180° equivalent to a path\ndifference of 2 À, since we assumed nwater > noil > nair. Because the two phase\nshifts were equal, they didn\'t affect our analysis.\nEXAMPLE 24-10\nThin film of air, wedge-shaped. A very fine wire\n7.35 × 10-3 mm in diameter is placed between two flat glass plates as in\nFig. 24-33a. Light whose wavelength in air is 600 nm falls (and is viewed) per-\npendicular to the plates and a series of bright and dark bands is seen, Fig. 24-33b.\nHow many light and dark bands will there be in this case? Will the area next to\nthe wire be bright or dark?\nAPPROACH We need to consider two effects: (1) path differences for rays\nreflecting from the two close surfaces (thin wedge of air between the two glass\nplates), and (2) the 2-cycle phase shift at the lower surface (point E in\nFig. 24-33a), where rays in air can enter glass (or be reflected). Because there is\na phase shift only at the lower surface, there will be a dark band (no reflection)\nwhen the path difference is 0, A, 2A, 3A, and so on. Since the light rays are\nperpendicular to the plates, the extra path length (DEF) equals 2t, where t is\nthe thickness of the air gap at any point.\nSOLUTION Dark bands will occur where\n2t = mì,\nm = 0, 1, 2, ....\nBright bands occur when 2t = (m + 2)>, where m is an integer. At the\nposition of the wire, t = 7.35 × 10-6m. At this point there will be\n2t/>=(2)(7.35×10-6m)/(6.00×10-7m) = 24.5 wavelengths. This is a "half\ninteger," so the area next to the wire will be bright. There will be a total\nof 25 dark lines along the plates, corresponding to path lengths DEF of\nΟλ, 1λ, 2λ, 3λ, ... , 24λ, including the one at the point of contact A (m = 0).\nBetween them, there will be 24 bright lines plus the one at the end, or 25.\nNOTE The bright and dark bands will be straight only if the glass plates are\nextremely flat. If they are not, the pattern is uneven, as in Fig. 24-33c. Thus we\nsee a very precise way of testing a glass surface for flatness. Spherical lens\nsurfaces can be tested for precision by placing the lens on a flat glass surface\nand observing Newton\'s rings (Fig. 24-31b) for perfect circularity.\n13\nn1\nn2> n1\n(a)\nn1\nn2<n1\n(b)\nFIGURE 24-32 (a) Reflected ray\nchanges phase by 180° or ¿ cycle if\nn2 > n1, but (b) does not if n2 < n1.\nFIGURE 24-33 (a) Light rays reflected\nfrom the upper and lower surfaces of\na thin wedge of air (between two glass\nplates) interfere to produce bright and\ndark bands.

They are shown at a slight\nangle so we can distinguish them.\nCAUTION\nA formula is not enough: you must also\ncheck for phase changes at surfaces\nFIGURE 24-29b (Repeated.)\nWhen white light (rather than monochromatic light) is incident on the thin\nwedge of air in Fig. 24-31a or 24-33a, a colorful series of fringes is seen because\nconstructive interference occurs for different wavelengths in the reflected light at\ndifferent thicknesses along the wedge.\nA soap bubble (Fig. 24-29a and Chapter-Opening Photo) is a thin spherical\nshell (or film) with air inside. The variations in thickness of a soap bubble film give\nrise to bright colors reflected from the soap bubble. (There is air on both sides of\nthe bubble film.) Similar variations in film thickness produce the bright colors seen\nreflecting from a thin layer of oil or gasoline on a puddle or lake (Fig. 24-29c).\nWhich wavelengths appear brightest also depends on the viewing angle.\nEXAMPLE 24-11\nThickness of soap bubble skin. A soap bubble appears\ngreen () = 540 nm) at the point on its front surface nearest the viewer. What is\nthe smallest thickness the soap bubble film could have? Assume n = 1.35.\nAPPROACH Assume the light is reflected perpendicularly from the point on a\nspherical surface nearest the viewer, Fig. 24-34. The light rays also reflect from\nthe inner surface of the soap bubble film as shown. The path difference of these\ntwo reflected rays is 2t, where t is the thickness of the soap film. Light reflected\nfrom the first (outer) surface undergoes a 180° phase change (index of refraction\nof soap is greater than that of air), whereas reflection at the second (inner) sur-\nface does not. To determine the thickness t for an interference maximum, we\nmust use the wavelength of light in the soap (n = 1.35).\nSOLUTION The 180° phase change at only one surface is equivalent to a 2 à path\ndifference. Therefore, green light is bright when the minimum path difference\nequals 2 An . Thus, 2t = \\n/2, so\n1 = 14 = Ân = (4)\n(4)(1.35)\n= 100 nm.\n(540 nm)\nThis is the smallest thickness.\nNOTE At this small thickness, blue (450 nm) and red (600 nm) also would reflect\nfairly constructively, so the bubble would appear almost white. The green color is\nmore likely to be seen at the next thickness that gives constructive interference,\n2t = 31/2n, because other colors would be more fully cancelled by destructive\ninterference. Then t would be t = 31/4n = 300 nm. Note that green is seen in\nair, so À = 540 nm (not À/n).\n*\nColors in a Thin Soap Film\nThe thin film of soapy water (in a plastic loop) shown in Fig. 24-29b (repeated\nhere) has stood vertically for a long time. Gravity has pulled the soapy water\ndownward, so the film increases in thickness going toward the bottom. The top\nsection is so thin (perhaps 30 nm thick << >) that light reflected from the front\nand back surfaces have almost zero path difference. Thus the 180° phase change\nat the front surface assures that the two reflected waves are 180° out of phase for\nall wavelengths of visible light. The white light incident on this thin film does\nnot reflect at the top part of the film, so the top is transparent and we see the\nbackground which is black.\nBelow the black area at the top, there is a thin blue line, and then a white\nband. The film has thickened to perhaps 75 to 100 nm, so the shortest wavelength\n(blue) light begins to partially interfere constructively. But just below, where the\nthickness is slightly greater (100 nm), the path difference is reasonably close to\n1/2 for much of the spectrum and we see white or silver.+\nImmediately below the white band in this Figure we see a brown band, where\nt ~ 200 nm, and many wavelengths (not all) are close to À-and those colors destruc-\ntively interfere, leaving only a few colors to partially interfere constructively,\ngiving us murky brown.\n+Why? Recall that red starts at 600 nm in air; so most colors in the spectrum lie between 450 nm and\n600 nm in air; but in water the wavelengths are n = 1.33 times smaller, 340 nm to 450 nm, so a\n100-nm thickness is a 200-nm path difference, not far from À/2 for most colors.\n696 CHAPTER 24\n", 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Farther down in Fig. 24-29b, with increasing thickness t, a path difference\n2t = 510 nm corresponds nicely to 2 A for blue, but not for other colors, so we see\nblue (2 ) path difference plus 2 A phase change = constructive interference). Other\ncolors experience constructive interference (at 2 ) and then at 2À) at still greater\nthicknesses, so going down we see a series of separated colors something like\na rainbow.\nIn the soap bubble of our Chapter-Opening Photo (page 679), similar things\nhappen: at the top (where the film is thinnest) we see black and then silver-white,\njust as in the soap film shown in Fig. 24-29b.\nAlso examine the oil film on wet pavement shown in Fig. 24-29c (repeated\nhere). The oil film is thickest at the center and thins out toward the edges. Notice\nthe whitish outer ring where most colors constructively interfere, which would\nsuggest a thickness on the order of 100 nm as discussed above for the white band\nin the soap film. Beyond the outer white band of the oil film, Fig. 24-29c, there is\nstill some oil, but the film is so thin that reflected light from upper and lower sur-\nfaces destructively interfere and you can see right through this very thin oil film.\nFIGURE 24-29c (Repeated.)\nLens Coatings\nAn important application of thin-film interference is in the coating of glass to\nmake it "nonreflecting," particularly for lenses. A glass surface reflects about 4%\nof the light incident upon it. Good-quality cameras, microscopes, and other\noptical devices may contain six to ten thin lenses. Reflection from all these surfaces\ncan reduce the light level considerably, and multiple reflections produce a\nbackground haze that reduces the quality of the image. By reducing reflection,\ntransmission and sharpness are increased.\nA very thin coating on the lens surfaces can reduce reflections considerably.\nThe thickness of the coating is chosen so that light (at least for one wavelength)\nreflecting from the front and rear surfaces of the film destructively interferes.\nDestructive interference can occur nearly completely for one particular wavelength\ndepending on the thickness of the coating. Nearby wavelengths will at least\npartially destructively interfere, but a single coating cannot eliminate reflections\nfor all wavelengths. Nonetheless, a single coating can reduce total reflection\nfrom 4% to 1% of the incident light. Often the coating is designed to eliminate\nthe center of the reflected spectrum (around 550 nm). The extremes of the\nspectrum-red and violet-will not be reduced as much. Since a mixture of red\nand violet produces purple, the light seen reflected from such coated lenses is\npurple (Fig. 24-35). Lenses containing two or three separate coatings can more\neffectively reduce a wider range of reflecting wavelengths.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nLens coatings\nFIGURE 24-35 A coated lens. Note\ncolor of light reflected from the\nfront lens surface.\nS\nOLVING\nInterference\nPROBLEM\n1. Interference effects depend on the simultaneous arri-\nval of two or more waves at the same point in space.\n2. Constructive interference occurs when waves with\nthe same wavelength arrive in phase with each other:\na crest of one wave arrives at the same time as a crest\nof the other wave(s). The amplitudes of the waves\nthen add to form a larger amplitude. Constructive\ninterference also occurs when the path difference is\nexactly one full wavelength or any integer multiple\nof a full wavelength: 1λ, 2λ, 3λ, ....\n3. Destructive interference occurs when a crest of one\nwave arrives at the same time as a trough of the other\nwave. The amplitudes add, but they are of opposite\nsign, so the total amplitude is reduced to zero if the\ntwo amplitudes are equal. Destructive interference\noccurs whenever the phase difference is half a wave\ncycle, or the path difference is a half-integral number\nof wavelengths. Thus, the total amplitude will be zero\nif two identical waves arrive one-half wavelength\nout of phase, or (m + 2) out of phase, where m is\nan integer.\n4. For thin-film interference, an extra half-wavelength\nphase shift occurs when light reflects from an opti-\ncally more dense medium (going from a material\nof lesser toward greater index of refraction).\nSECTION 24-8 Interference in Thin Films 697\n', 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Coating\nAir\n2\n1\nGlass\nTransmitted\nray\nIncident ray\nFIGURE 24-36 Lens coating,\nExample 24-12.

Interference effects. Consider two rays reflected from the front and rear sur-\nfaces of the coating on the lens as shown in Fig. 24-36. The rays are drawn\nnot quite perpendicular to the lens so we can see each of them. These two\nreflected rays will interfere with each other.\n2. Constructive interference. We want to eliminate reflected light, so we do not\nconsider constructive interference.\n3. Destructive interference. To eliminate reflection, we want reflected rays 1\nand 2 to be 2 cycle out of phase with each other so that they destructively\ninterfere. The phase difference is due to the path difference 2t traveled by\nray 2, as well as any phase change in either ray due to reflection.\n4. Reflection phase shift. Rays 1 and 2 both undergo a change of phase by 2 cycle\nwhen they reflect from the coating\'s front and rear surfaces, respectively (at\nboth surfaces the index of refraction increases). Thus there is no net change in\nphase due to the reflections. The net phase difference will be due to the extra\npath 2t taken by ray 2 in the coating, where n = 1.38. We want 2t to equal 2 Àn\nso that destructive interference occurs, where Àn = A/n is the wavelength\nin the coating. With 2t = \\n/2 = >/2n, then\nt\n=\n=\nl\n4\n=\n(550 nm)\n= 99.6 nm.\n(4)(1.38)\nNOTE We could have set 2t = (m + 2)An, where m is an integer. The smallest\nthickness (m = 0) is usually chosen because destructive interference will occur\nover the widest angle.\nNOTE Complete destructive interference occurs only for the given wavelength of\nvisible light. Longer and shorter wavelengths will have only partial cancellation.\n*\n24-9 Michelson Interferometer\nFIGURE 24-37 Michelson\ninterferometer.\nM1 (movable mirror)\nSource\n1\nMs\n2\nEye\nM2\n(fixed mirror)\nA useful instrument involving wave interference is the Michelson interferometer\n(Fig. 24-37),+ invented by the American Albert A. Michelson (Section 22-4).\nMonochromatic light from a single point on an extended source is shown striking\na half-silvered mirror Ms . This beam splitter mirror Ms has a thin layer of silver\nthat reflects only half the light that hits it, so that half of the beam passes through\nto a fixed mirror M2, where it is reflected back. The other half is reflected by Ms\nto a mirror M1 that is movable (by a fine-thread screw), where it is also reflected\nback. Upon its return, part of beam 1 passes through Ms and reaches a sensor or\nthe eye; and part of beam 2, on its return, is reflected by Ms into the eye. If the two\npath lengths are identical, the two coherent beams entering the eye constructively\ninterfere and brightness will be seen. If the movable mirror is moved a distance\n1/4, one beam will travel an extra distance equal to À/2 (because it travels back\nand forth over the distance \\/4). In this case, the two beams will destructively\ninterfere and darkness will be seen. As M1 is moved farther, brightness will recur\n(when the path difference is )), then darkness, and so on.\nVery precise length measurements can be made with an interferometer. The\nmotion of mirror M1 by only 4 À produces a clear difference between brightness\nand darkness. For À = 400 nm, this means a precision of 100 nm, or 10-4 mm! If\nmirror M1 is tilted very slightly, the bright or dark spots are seen instead as a\nseries of bright and dark lines or "fringes" that move as M1 moves. By counting\nthe number of fringes (or fractions thereof) that pass a reference line, extremely\nprecise length measurements can be made.\n*There are other types of interferometer, but Michelson\'s is the best known.\n698 CHAPTER 24\n', 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': "24-10 Polarization\nAn important and useful property of light is that it can be polarized. To see what\nthis means, let us examine waves traveling on a rope. A rope can oscillate in a\nvertical plane, Fig. 24-38a, or in a horizontal plane, Fig. 24-38b. In either case,\nthe wave is said to be linearly polarized or plane-polarized-the oscillations are\nin a plane.\nIf we now place an obstacle containing a vertical slit in the path of the wave,\nFig. 24-39, a vertically polarized wave passes through the vertical slit, but a\nhorizontally polarized wave will not. If a horizontal slit were used, the vertically\npolarized wave would be stopped. If both types of slit were used, both types of wave\nwould be stopped by one slit or the other. Note that polarization can exist only for\ntransverse waves, and not for longitudinal waves such as sound. The latter oscillate\nonly along the direction of motion, and neither orientation of slit would stop them.\n(a)\n8\n(b)\nFIGURE 24-38 Transverse waves\non a rope polarized (a) in a vertical\nplane and (b) in a horizontal plane.\nFIGURE 24-39 (a) A vertically polarized\nwave passes through a vertical slit, but\n(b) a horizontally polarized wave will not.\n(a)\n(b)\nMaxwell's theory of light as electromagnetic (EM) waves predicted that light can\nbe polarized since an EM wave is a transverse wave. The direction of polarization in\na plane-polarized EM wave is taken as the direction of the electric field vector E.\nLight is not necessarily polarized. It can also be unpolarized, which means\nthat the source has oscillations in many planes at once, as shown in Fig. 24-40.\nOrdinary lightbulbs emit unpolarized light, as does the Sun.\nFIGURE 24-40 (a) Oscillation\nof the electric field vectors in\nunpolarized light. The light is traveling\ninto or out of the page. (b) Electric\nfield in linear polarized light.\n(a)\n(b)\nPolaroids (Polarization by Absorption)\nPlane-polarized light can be obtained from unpolarized light using certain crystals\nsuch as tourmaline. Or, more commonly, we use a Polaroid sheet. (Polaroid materials\nwere invented in 1929 by Edwin Land.) A Polaroid sheet consists of long complex\nmolecules arranged parallel to one another. Such a Polaroid acts like a series of\nparallel slits to allow one orientation of polarization to pass through nearly\nundiminished. This direction is called the transmission axis of the Polaroid. Polariza-\ntion perpendicular to this direction is absorbed almost completely by the Polaroid.\nAbsorption by a Polaroid can be explained at the molecular level. An electric\nfield E that oscillates parallel to the long molecules can set electrons into motion\nalong the molecules, thus doing work on them and transferring energy. Hence, if E\nis parallel to the molecules, it gets absorbed. An electric field E perpendicular to\nthe long molecules does not have this possibility of doing work and transferring\nits energy, and so passes through freely. When we speak of the transmission axis\nof a Polaroid, we mean the direction for which E is passed, so a Polaroid axis is\nperpendicular to the long molecules.

Thus, a Polaroid passes only that component\nof polarization (the electric field vector, E) that is parallel to its transmission axis.\nBecause the intensity of a light beam is proportional to the square of the amplitude\n(Sections 11-9 and 22-5), the intensity of a plane-polarized beam transmitted by\na polarizer is proportional to (Eo cos 0)2, a relation called Malus' law,\nI = Lo cos2 0,\nintensity of plane-polarized\n-\n(24-5)\nwave passed by polarizer\nwhere Io is the incoming intensity and 0 is the angle between the polarizer trans-\nmission axis and the plane of polarization of the incoming wave.\nA Polaroid can be used as a polarizer to produce plane-polarized light\nfrom unpolarized light, since only the component of light parallel to the axis is\ntransmitted. A Polaroid can also be used as an analyzer to determine (1) if light is\npolarized and (2) the plane of polarization. A Polaroid acting as an analyzer will\npass the same amount of light independent of the orientation of its axis if the\nlight is unpolarized; try rotating one lens of a pair of Polaroid sunglasses while\nlooking through it at a lightbulb. If the light is polarized, however, when you\nrotate the Polaroid the transmitted light will be a maximum when the plane of\npolarization is parallel to the Polaroid's transmission axis, and a minimum when\nperpendicular to it. If you do this while looking at the sky, preferably at right\nangles to the Sun's direction, you will see that skylight is polarized. (Direct sunlight\nis unpolarized, but don't look directly at the Sun, even through a polarizer, for\ndamage to the eye may occur.) If the light transmitted by an analyzer Polaroid\nfalls to zero at one orientation, then the light is 100% plane-polarized. If it merely\nreaches a minimum, the light is partially polarized.\nUnpolarized light consists of light with random directions of polarization.\nEach of these polarization directions can be resolved into components along two\nmutually perpendicular directions. On average, an unpolarized beam can be\nthought of as two plane-polarized beams of equal magnitude perpendicular to\none another. When unpolarized light passes through a polarizer, one component\nis eliminated. So the intensity of the light passing through is reduced by half\nbecause half the light is eliminated: I = 2 Io (Fig. 24-42).\nWhen two Polaroids are crossed-that is, their polarizing axes are perpendicular\nto one another-unpolarized light can be entirely stopped. As shown in Fig. 24-43,\nunpolarized light is made plane-polarized by the first Polaroid (the polarizer).\nThe second Polaroid, the analyzer, then eliminates this component since its trans-\nmission axis is perpendicular to the first.\nPolarizer\n(axis vertical)\nAnalyzer\n(axis horizontal)\nFIGURE 24-43 Crossed Polaroids\ncompletely eliminate light.\nLight\ndirection\nUnpolarized\nlight\nPlane-polarized\nlight\nNo light\n700 CHAPTER 24 The Wave Nature of Light\n", 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 23, 'type': 'text', 'content': "You can try this with Polaroid sunglasses (Fig. 24-44). Note that Polaroid sun-\nglasses eliminate 50% of unpolarized light because of their polarizing property;\nthey absorb even more because they are colored. Plane-polarized light in any\ndirection is also stopped by crossed Polaroids.\nEXAMPLE 24-13\nTwo Polaroids at 60°. Unpolarized light passes through\ntwo Polaroids; the axis of the first is vertical and that of the second is at 60° to\nthe vertical. Describe the orientation and intensity of the transmitted light.\nAPPROACH Half of the unpolarized light is absorbed by the first Polaroid, and the\nremaining light emerges plane-polarized vertically. When that light passes through\nthe second Polaroid, the intensity is further reduced according to Eq. 24-5,\nand the plane of polarization is then along the axis of the second Polaroid.\nSOLUTION The first Polaroid eliminates half the light, so the intensity is\nreduced by half: I1 = 2 10. The light reaching the second polarizer is vertically\npolarized and so is reduced in intensity (Eq. 24-5) to\nI2 = I1(cos 60°)2 = 411.\nThus, I2 = § Io.

Thus\nthe angle in Eq. 24-5 is that between the transmission axes of each pair of\nPolaroids taken in turn. The first Polaroid changes the unpolarized light to\nplane-polarized and reduces the intensity from Io to I1 = 2 10.

When light strikes a nonmetallic surface at any angle other than\nperpendicular, the reflected beam is polarized preferentially in the plane parallel\nto the surface, Fig. 24-46. In other words, the component with polarization in the\nplane perpendicular to the surface is preferentially transmitted or absorbed. You\ncan check this by rotating Polaroid sunglasses while looking through them at\na flat surface of a lake or road. Since most outdoor surfaces are horizontal,\nPolaroid sunglasses are made with their axes vertical to eliminate the more\nstrongly reflected horizontal component, and thus reduce glare.\nFIGURE 24-46 Light reflected from a\nnonmetallic surface, such as the smooth\nsurface of water in a lake, is partially\npolarized parallel to the surface.\nSECTION 24-10 Polarization 701\n", 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 24, 'type': 'text', 'content': "FIGURE 24-47 Photographs of a\nlake, (a) allowing all light into the\ncamera lens, and (b) using a polarizer.\nThe polarizer is adjusted to absorb\nmost of the (polarized) light reflected\nfrom the water's surface, allowing the\ndimmer light from the bottom of the\nlake, and any fish lying there, to be\nseen more readily.\n(a)\n(b)\nPeople who go fishing wear Polaroids to eliminate reflected glare from the\nsurface of a lake or stream and thus see beneath the water more clearly (Fig. 24-47).\nThe amount of polarization in the reflected beam depends on the angle,\nvarying from no polarization at normal incidence to 100% polarization at an angle\nknown as the polarizing angle 0p .* This angle is related to the index of refraction\nof the two materials on either side of the boundary by the equation\ntan 0p\n=\nn2,\n(24-6a)\nn1\nwhere n1 is the index of refraction of the material in which the incident beam is\ntraveling, and n2 is that of the medium beyond the reflecting boundary.

Equations 24-6 can be derived from the electromagnetic\nwave theory of light. It is interesting that at Brewster's angle, the reflected ray\nand the transmitted (refracted) ray make a 90° angle to each other; that is,\n0p + 0r = 90°, where or is the refraction angle (Fig. 24-48).

LCDs are\nused as the display in cell phones, other hand-held electronic devices, and flat-panel\ncomputer and television screens.\nA liquid crystal display is made up of many tiny rectangles called pixels, or\n"picture elements." The picture you see depends on which pixels are dark or light\nand of what color, as suggested in Fig. 24-49 for a simple black and white picture.\nLiquid crystals are organic materials that at room temperature exist in a\nphase that is neither fully solid nor fully liquid. They are sort of gooey, and their\nmolecules display a randomness of position characteristic of liquids, as dis-\ncussed in Section 13-1 and Fig. 13-2b. They also show some of the orderliness of a\nsolid crystal (Fig. 13-2a), but only in one dimension.\nThe liquid crystals we find useful are made up of relatively rigid rod-like\nmolecules that interact weakly with each other and tend to align parallel to each\nother, as shown in Fig. 24-50.\nIn a simple LCD, each pixel (picture element) contains liquid crystal material\nsandwiched between two glass plates whose inner surfaces have been brushed\nto form nanometer-wide parallel scratches. The rod-like liquid crystal molecules\nin contact with the scratches tend to line up along the scratches. The two plates\ntypically have their scratches at 90° to each other, and the weak electric forces\nbetween the rod-like molecules tend to keep them nearly aligned with their\nnearest neighbors, resulting in the twisted pattern shown in Fig. 24-51a.\nThe outer surfaces of the glass plates each have a thin film polarizer, they too\noriented at 90° to each other. Unpolarized light incident from the left becomes\nplane-polarized, and the liquid crystal molecules keep this polarization aligned\nwith their rod-like shape. That is, the plane of polarization of the light rotates\nwith the molecules as the light passes through the liquid crystal. The light emerges\nwith its plane of polarization rotated by 90°, and readily passes through the second\npolarizer, Fig. 24-51a. A tiny LCD pixel in this situation will appear bright.\nGlass\nUnpolarized\nlight source\n+\nLiquid\ncrystal\n100000\nAxis\nLiquid\ncrystal\nVertical\nscratches\non glass\nVertical\npolarizer\nVertically\npolarized\nlight entering\nliquid crystal\nHorizontal\nscratches\nBright\nlight\nexits\nScreen\nPolarizing\naxis\nor\nmirror\nAxis\nHorizontal\npolarizer\nHorizontally\npolarized\nlight\nFIGURE 24-49 Example of an\nimage made up of many small\nsquares or pixels (picture elements).\nFIGURE 24-50 Liquid crystal molecules\ntend to align in one dimension\n(parallel to each other) but have\nrandom positions (left-right, up-down).\nV\n+\ngood\nNo\nlight\nexits\nAxis\nLight still\nvertically\npolarized\nHorizontal\npolarizer\n(b) Voltage on\n(a) Voltage off\nNow suppose a voltage is applied to transparent electrodes on each glass\nplate of the pixel. The rod-like molecules are polar (or can acquire an internal\nseparation of charge due to the applied electric field). The applied voltage tends\nto align the molecules end-to-end, and they no longer follow the careful twisted\npattern shown in Fig. 24-51a. Instead the applied electric field tends to align the\nmolecules end-to-end, left to right (perpendicular to the glass plates), Fig. 24-51b,\nand then they don\'t affect the light polarization significantly. The entering plane-\npolarized light no longer has its plane of polarization rotated as it passes through\nthe liquid crystal, and no light can exit through the second (horizontal) polarizer\n(Fig. 24-51b). With the voltage on, the pixel appears dark.+\n*Some displays use an opposite system: the polarizers are parallel to each other (the scratches remain\nat 90° to maintain the twist). Then voltage off results in black (no light), and voltage on results in\nbright light.\nFIGURE 24-51 (a) "Twisted" form\nof liquid crystal.

There are only a few pixels, corresponding to the\nelongated segments needed to form the numbers from 0 to 9 (and letters in some\ndisplays), as seen in Fig. 24-52. Any pixels to which a voltage is applied appear\ndark and form part of a number. With no voltage, pixels pass light through the\npolarizers to the mirror and back out, which forms a bright background. Displays\nwith white numbers on a dark background have the voltages reversed.\nTelevision, cell phone, and computer LCDs are more sophisticated. A color\npixel consists of three cells, or subpixels, each covered with a red, green, or blue\nfilter (Fig. 24-53). Varying brightnesses of these three primary colors can yield\nalmost any natural color. A good-quality screen consists of millions of pixels.\nBehind this array of pixels is a light source, often thin fluorescent tubes the\ndiameter of a straw, or light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The light passes through the\nliquid crystal subpixels, or not, depending on the voltage applied to each, as we\ndiscussed in detail in Section 17-11. See especially Figs. 17-31 and 17-33.\n[To obtain a range of gray scale or range of color brightness, each subpixel can-\nnot simply go on or off as in Fig. 24-51. Several techniques can be used depending\non the construction of the LCD. If the voltage applied in Fig. 24-51b is small enough,\nthe disorientation of the molecules may be small, allowing some rotation of the\npolarization vector and thus some light can pass through, the actual amount\ndepending on the voltage. Alternatively, each subpixel can be pulsed-the length\nof time it is on affects the perceived brightness. The effect of stronger or weaker\nbrightness can instead be provided by the number of nearby subpixels of the same\ncolor that are turned on or off; this third system lets the eye "average" over many\npixels, but reduces the sharpness or resolution of the picture.]\n*24-12 Scattering of Light by the Atmosphere\nFIGURE 24-54 Unpolarized sunlight\nscattered by molecules of the air.

In Fig. 24-54 we see unpolarized light from the Sun\nimpinging on a molecule of the Earth\'s atmosphere. The electric field of the EM\nwave sets the electric charges within the molecule into oscillation, and the mole-\ncule absorbs some of the incident radiation. But the molecule quickly reemits this\nlight since the charges are oscillating. As discussed in Section 22-2, oscillating\nelectric charges produce EM waves. The intensity is strongest along the direction\nperpendicular to the oscillation, and drops to zero along the line of oscillation\n(Section 22-2). In Fig. 24-54 the motion of the charges is resolved into two compo-\nnents. An observer at right angles to the direction of the sunlight, as shown, will\nsee plane-polarized light because no light is emitted along the line of the other\ncomponent of the oscillation. (When viewing along the line of an oscillation, you\ndon\'t see that oscillation, and hence see no waves made by it.) At other viewing\nangles, both components will be present; one will be stronger, however, so the\nlight appears partially polarized. Thus, the process of scattering explains the\npolarization of skylight.\nScattering of light by the Earth\'s atmosphere depends on wavelength À. For\nparticles much smaller than the wavelength of light (such as molecules of air), the\nparticles will be less of an obstruction to long wavelengths than to short ones. The\nscattering decreases, in fact, as 1/14. Blue and violet light are thus scattered much\nmore than red and orange, which is why the sky looks blue. At sunset, the Sun\'s rays\npass through a maximum length of atmosphere. Much of the blue has been taken\nout by scattering. The light that reaches us at this low angle where the Sun is near\nthe horizon, and reflects off clouds and haze, is thus lacking in blue. That is why\nsunsets appear reddish.\nThe dependence of scattering on 1/14 is valid only if the scattering objects\nare much smaller than the wavelength of the light. This is valid for oxygen and\nnitrogen molecules whose diameters are about 0.2 nm. Clouds, however, contain\nwater droplets or crystals that are much larger than À. They scatter all frequencies\nof light nearly uniformly. Hence clouds appear white (or gray, if shadowed).\n704 CHAPTER 24\n', 'chapter_title': 'A C'}, {'page_number': 27, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Summary\nThe wave theory of light is strongly supported by observations\nthat light exhibits interference and diffraction. Wave theory also\nexplains the refraction of light and the fact that light travels more\nslowly in transparent solids and liquids than it does in air.\n[*An aid to predicting wave behavior is Huygens' principle,\nwhich states that every point on a wave front can be considered\nas a source of tiny wavelets that spread out in the forward\ndirection at the speed of the wave itself. The new wave front is\nthe envelope (the common tangent) of all the wavelets.]\nThe wavelength of light in a medium with index of refrac-\ntion n is\nÀn = 4,\n(24-1)\nwhere À is the wavelength in vacuum; the frequency is not\nchanged.\nYoung's double-slit experiment demonstrated the inter-\nference of light. The observed bright spots of the interference\npattern are explained as constructive interference between the\nbeams coming through the two slits, where the beams differ in\npath length by an integral number of wavelengths. The dark\nareas in between are due to destructive interference when the\npath lengths differ by 2 2, 2 A, and so on. The angles 0 at which\nconstructive interference occurs are given by\nsin e = m .\n(24-2a)\nwhere À is the wavelength of the light, d is the separation of the\nslits, and m is an integer (0, 1, 2, ... ). Destructive interference\noccurs at angles 0 given by\nsin 0 = (m +) .\n(24-2b)\nwhere m is an integer (0, 1, 2, ... ).\nTwo sources of light are perfectly coherent if the waves\nleaving them are of the same single frequency and maintain the\nsame phase relationship at all times. If the light waves from the\ntwo sources have a random phase with respect to each other\nover time (as for two lightbulbs), the two sources are\nincoherent.\nThe frequency or wavelength of light determines its color.\nThe visible spectrum in air extends from about 400 nm (violet)\nto about 750 nm (red).\nGlass prisms spread white light into its constituent colors\nbecause the index of refraction varies with wavelength, a phe-\nnomenon known as dispersion.\nThe formula sin 0 = mì/d for constructive interference\nalso holds for a diffraction grating, which consists of many\nparallel slits or lines, separated from each other by a distance d.\nQuestions\n1. Does Huygens' principle apply to sound waves? To water\nwaves? Explain how Huygens' principle makes sense for\nwater waves, where each point vibrates up and down.\n2. Why is light sometimes described as rays and sometimes as\nwaves?\n3. We can hear sounds around corners but we cannot see\naround corners; yet both sound and light are waves.\nExplain the difference.\nThe peaks of constructive interference are much brighter and\nsharper for a diffraction grating than for a two-slit apparatus.\nA diffraction grating (or a prism) is used in a spectrometer\nto separate different colors and observe line spectra. For a given\norder m, 0 depends on À. Precise determination of wavelength\ncan be done with a spectrometer by careful measurement of 0.\nDiffraction refers to the fact that light, like other waves,\nbends around objects it passes, and spreads out after passing\nthrough narrow slits. This bending gives rise to a diffraction\npattern due to interference between rays of light that travel\ndifferent distances.\nLight passing through a very narrow slit of width D (on\nthe order of the wavelength A) will produce a pattern with a\nbright central maximum of half-width 0 given by\nsin 0 = B\n(24-3a)\nflanked by fainter lines to either side.\nLight reflected from the front and rear surfaces of a thin\nfilm of transparent material can interfere constructively or\ndestructively, depending on the path difference. A phase change\nof 180° or 2 À occurs when the light reflects at a surface where\nthe index of refraction increases. Such thin-film interference\nhas many practical applications, such as lens coatings and using\nNewton's rings to check uniformity of glass surfaces.\nIn unpolarized light, the electric field vectors oscillate in all\ntransverse directions. If the electric vector oscillates only in one\nplane, the light is said to be plane-polarized. Light can also be\npartially polarized.\nWhen an unpolarized light beam passes through a Polaroid\nsheet, the emerging beam is plane-polarized. When a light beam\nis polarized and passes through a Polaroid, the intensity varies\nas the Polaroid is rotated. Thus a Polaroid can act as a polarizer\nor as an analyzer.\nThe intensity I0 of a plane-polarized light beam incident on\na Polaroid is reduced to\nI = 10 cos2 0\n(24-5)\nwhere 0 is the angle between the axis of the Polaroid and the\ninitial plane of polarization.\nLight can also be partially or fully polarized by reflection.\nIf light traveling in air is reflected from a medium of index of\nrefraction n, the reflected beam will be completely plane-polarized\nif the incident angle 0p is given by\ntan 0p = n.\n(24-6b)\nThe fact that light can be polarized shows that it must be a trans-\nverse wave.\n4.

Compare Figs. 24-5, 24-6, and 24-7, which are different\nrepresentations of the double-slit experiment. For each\nfigure state the direction the light is traveling. Where are\nthe wave crests in terms of this direction? How are they\nrepresented in each figure? Give one advantage of each\nfigure in helping you understand the double-slit experiment\nand interference.\n2. Discuss the similarities, and differences, of double-slit inter-\nference and single-slit diffraction.\n3. When can we use geometric optics as in Chapter 23, and\nwhen do we need to use the more complicated wave model\nof light discussed in Chapter 24? In particular, what are\nthe physical characteristics that matter in making this\ndecision?\n4. Suppose you viewed the light transmitted through a thin\ncoating layered on a flat piece of glass. Draw a diagram,\nsimilar to Fig. 24-30 or 24-36, and describe the conditions\nrequired for maxima and minima. Consider all possible\nvalues of index of refraction. Discuss the relative intensity of\nthe minima compared to the maxima and to zero.\n5. What percent of visible light is reflected from plain glass?\nAssume your answer refers to transmission through each\nsurface, front and back. How does the presence of multiple\nlenses in a good camera degrade the image? What is\nsuggested in Section 24-8 to reduce this reflection?\nExplain in words, and sketch how this solution works.\nFor a glass lens in air, about how much improvement does\nthis solution provide?\nANSWERS TO EXERCISES\nA: 333 nm; 6.0 × 1014 Hz; 2.0 × 108 m/s.\nE: (e).\nB: 2.5 mm.\nF: Zero for both (a) and (b), because the two successive\nC: Narrower.\npolarizers at 90° cancel all light.
