By the early 1930s, a model of the nucleus had been\ndeveloped that is still useful. According to this model, a nucleus is made up of\ntwo types of particles: protons and neutrons. [These "particles" also have wave\nproperties, but for ease of visualization and language, we usually refer to them\nsimply as "particles."] A proton is the nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen.\nThe proton has a positive charge (= +e = +1.60 × 10-19 C, the same magnitude\nas for the electron) and its mass is measured to be\nmp = 1.67262 × 10-27 kg.\nThe neutron, whose existence was ascertained in 1932 by the English physicist\nJames Chadwick (1891-1974), is electrically neutral (q = 0), as its name implies.\nIts mass is very slightly larger than that of the proton:\nmn = 1.67493 × 10-27 kg.\nThese two constituents of a nucleus, neutrons and protons, are referred to collec-\ntively as nucleons.\nAlthough a normal hydrogen nucleus consists of a single proton alone, the\nnuclei of all other elements consist of both neutrons and protons. The different\nnuclei are often referred to as nuclides. The number of protons in a nucleus (or\nnuclide) is called the atomic number and is designated by the symbol Z. The total\nnumber of nucleons, neutrons plus protons, is designated by the symbol A and is\ncalled the atomic mass number, or sometimes simply mass number. This name is\nused since the mass of a nucleus is very closely A times the mass of one nucleon.\nA nuclide with 7 protons and 8 neutrons thus has Z = 7 and A = 15. The\nneutron number Nis N = A - Z.\nTo specify a given nuclide, we need give only A and Z. A special symbol is\ncommonly used which takes the form\nAX,\nwhere X is the chemical symbol for the element (see Appendix B, and the Periodic\nTable inside the back cover), A is the atomic mass number, and Z is the atomic\nnumber. For example, 12N means a nitrogen nucleus containing 7 protons and\n8 neutrons for a total of 15 nucleons. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons\norbiting the nucleus is equal to the atomic number Z (since the charge on an\nelectron has the same magnitude but opposite sign to that of a proton). The main\nproperties of an atom, and how it interacts with other atoms, are largely deter-\nmined by the number of electrons. Hence Z determines what kind of atom it is:\ncarbon, oxygen, gold, or whatever. It is redundant to specify both the symbol of\na nucleus and its atomic number Z as described above. If the nucleus is nitrogen,\nfor example, we know immediately that Z = 7. The subscript Z is thus sometimes\ndropped and 15N is then written simply 15N; in words we say "nitrogen fifteen."\nFor a particular type of atom (say, carbon), nuclei are found to contain dif-\nferent numbers of neutrons, although they all have the same number of protons.\nFor example, carbon nuclei always have 6 protons, but they may have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\nor 10 neutrons. Nuclei that contain the same number of protons but different\nnumbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Thus, 11C, 12C, 13C, 14C, 16C, and 16C\nare all isotopes of carbon. The isotopes of a given element are not all equally\ncommon. For example, 98.9% of naturally occurring carbon (on Earth) is the\nisotope 12C, and about 1.1% is 13C. These percentages are referred to as the\nnatural abundances.+ Even hydrogen has isotopes: 99.99% of natural hydrogen\nis 1H, a simple proton, as the nucleus; there are also 2H, called deuterium,\nand 3H, tritium, which besides the proton contain 1 or 2 neutrons. (The bare\nnucleus in each case is called the deuteron and triton.)\n*The mass value for each element as given in the Periodic Table (inside back cover) is an average\nweighted according to the natural abundances of its isotopes.\n858 CHAPTER 30 Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Many isotopes that do not occur naturally can be produced in the laboratory\nby means of nuclear reactions (more on this later). Indeed, all elements beyond\nuranium (Z > 92) do not occur naturally on Earth and are only produced artifi-\ncially (in the laboratory), as are many nuclides with Z ≤ 92.\nThe approximate size of nuclei was determined originally by Rutherford from\nthe scattering of charged particles by thin metal foils. We cannot speak about a\ndefinite size for nuclei because of the wave-particle duality (Section 27-7): their\nspatial extent must remain somewhat fuzzy. Nonetheless a rough "size" can be\nmeasured by scattering high-speed electrons off nuclei. It is found that nuclei\nhave a roughly spherical shape with a radius that increases with A according to\nthe approximate formula\nr ~ (1.2 × 10-15 m)( Az).\n(30-1)\nSince the volume of a sphere is V = Tr3, we see that the volume of a nucleus is\napproximately proportional to the number of nucleons, V & A (because (A3)3 = A).\nThis is what we would expect if nucleons were like impenetrable billiard balls: if\nyou double the number of balls, you double the total volume. Hence, all nuclei\nhave nearly the same density, and it is enormous (see Example 30-2).\nThe metric abbreviation for 10-15 m is the fermi (after Enrico Fermi,\nFig. 30-7) or the femtometer, fm (see Table 1-4 or inside the front cover). Thus\n1.2 × 10-15 m = 1.2 fm or 1.2 fermis.\nEXAMPLE 30-1\nESTIMATE\nNuclear sizes. Estimate the diameter of the\nsmallest and largest naturally occurring nuclei: (a) 1H, (b) 232U.\nAPPROACH The radius r of a nucleus is related to its number of nucleons A by\nEq. 30-1. The diameter d = 2r.\nSOLUTION (a) For hydrogen, A = 1, Eq. 30-1 gives\nd = diameter = 2r ~ 2(1.2 × 10-15 m)(As) = 2.4 × 10-15 m\nsince A3 = 13 = 1.\n(b) For uranium d ~ (2.4 × 10-15 m)(238)3 = 15× 10-15 m.\nThe range of nuclear diameters is only from 2.4 fm to 15 fm.\nNOTE Because nuclear radii vary as A3, the largest nuclei (such as uranium\nwith A = 238) have a radius only about 1/238 ~ 6 times that of the smallest,\nhydrogen (A = 1).\nEXAMPLE 30-2\nESTIMATE\nNuclear and atomic densities. Compare the\ndensity of nuclear matter to the density of normal solids.\nAPPROACH The density of normal liquids and solids is on the order of 103 to\n104 kg/m3 (see Table 10-1), and because the atoms are close packed, atoms have\nabout this density too. We therefore compare the density (mass per volume) of\na nucleus to that of its atom as a whole.\nSOLUTION The mass of a proton is greater than the mass of an electron by a factor\n1.67 × 10-27 kg\n~ 2000.\n9.1 × 10-31 kg\nThus, over 99.9% of the mass of an atom is in the nucleus, and for our estimate we\ncan say the mass of the atom equals the mass of the nucleus, mnucl/matom = 1.\nAtoms have a radius of about 10-10 m (Chapter 27) and nuclei on the order of\n10-15 m (Eq. 30-1).

Indeed the existence of different isotopes of the\nsame element (different number of neutrons) was discovered using this device.\nSECTION 30-1 859\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': "CAUTION\nMasses are for neutral atom\n(nucleus plus electrons)\nNuclear masses can be specified in unified atomic mass units (u). On this scale,\na neutral 12C atom is given the exact value 12.000000 u. A neutron then has a meas-\nured mass of 1.008665 u, a proton 1.007276 u, and a neutral hydrogen atom 1H\n(proton plus electron) 1.007825 u. The masses of many nuclides are given in\nAppendix B.

This can be done because mass and energy are related, and the\nprecise relationship is given by Einstein's equation E = mc2 (Chapter 26).

Compare the\nmass of a 4He atom to the total mass of its constituent particles.\nAPPROACH The 4He nucleus contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons. Tables normally\ngive the masses of neutral atoms-that is, nucleus plus its Z electrons. We must\ntherefore be sure to balance out the electrons when we compare masses. Thus we\nuse the mass of 1H rather than that of a proton alone. We look up the mass\nof the 4He atom in Appendix B (it includes the mass of 2 electrons), as well as\nthe mass for the 2 neutrons and 2 hydrogen atoms (= 2 protons + 2 electrons).\n860 CHAPTER 30 Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity\n", 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'SOLUTION The mass of a neutral 4He atom, from Appendix B, is 4.002603 u.\nThe mass of two neutrons and two H atoms (2 protons including the 2 electrons) is\n2mn = 2(1.008665 u) = 2.017330 u\n2m(H) = 2(1.007825 u) = 2.015650 u\nsum = 4.032980 u.\nThus the mass of 4He is measured to be less than the masses of its constituents\nby an amount 4.032980 u - 4.002603 u = 0.030377 u.\nWhere has this lost mass of 0.030377 u disappeared to? It must be E = mc2.\nIf the four nucleons suddenly came together to form a 4He nucleus, the mass\n"loss" would appear as energy of another kind (such as radiation, or kinetic\nenergy). The mass (or energy) difference in the case of 4He, given in energy units,\nis (0.030377 u)(931.5 MeV/u) = 28.30 MeV. This difference is referred to as\nthe total binding energy of the nucleus. The total binding energy represents the\namount of energy that must be put into a nucleus in order to break it apart into\nits constituents. If the mass of, say, a 4He nucleus were exactly equal to the mass\nof two neutrons plus two protons, the nucleus could fall apart without any input\nof energy. To be stable, the mass of a nucleus must be less than that of its con-\nstituent nucleons, so that energy input is needed to break it apart.\nCAUTION\nMass of nucleus must be less\nthan mass of constituents\nBinding energy is not something a nucleus has-it is energy it "lacks"\nrelative to the total mass of its separate constituents.\n[As a comparison, we saw in Chapter 27 that the binding energy of the one\nelectron in the hydrogen atom is 13.6 eV; so the mass of a 1H atom is less\nthan that of a single proton plus a single electron by 13.6 eV/c2. The binding\nenergies of nuclei are on the order of MeV, so the eV binding energies of elec-\ntrons can be ignored. Nuclear binding energies, compared to nuclear masses, are\non the order of (28 MeV/4000 MeV) ~ 1 × 10-2, where we used helium\'s binding\nenergy of 28.3 MeV (see above) and mass ~ 4 × 940 MeV ~ 4000 MeV.]\nEXERCISE A Determine how much less the mass of the 3Li nucleus is compared to that\nof its constituents. See Appendix B.\nThe binding energy per nucleon is defined as the total binding energy of a\nnucleus divided by A, the total number of nucleons. We calculated above that\nthe binding energy of 4He is 28.3 MeV, so its binding energy per nucleon is\n28.3 MeV/4 = 7.1 MeV. Figure 30-1 shows the measured binding energy per\nnucleon as a function of A for stable nuclei. The curve rises as A increases and\nreaches a plateau at about 8.7 MeV per nucleon above A ~ 40. Beyond A ~ 80,\nthe curve decreases slowly, indicating that larger nuclei are held together less tightly\nthan those in the middle of the Periodic Table. We will see later that these charac-\nteristics allow the release of nuclear energy in the processes of fission and fusion.\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n80\n56 Fe\n261\n120\n50 Sn\n4He\n238U-\n2He\n2H\nBinding energy per nucleon (MeV)\nFIGURE 30-1 Binding energy per\nnucleon for the more stable\nnuclides as a function of mass\nnumber A.\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nNumber of nucleons, A (mass number)\nSECTION 30-2 861\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 30-4\nBinding energy for iron.

That is, it would\nrequire 4.95 MeV input of energy to remove one neutron from 13C.\nNuclear Forces\nWe can analyze nuclei not only from the point of view of energy, but also from\nthe point of view of the forces that hold them together. We might not expect a\ncollection of protons and neutrons to come together spontaneously, since protons\nare all positively charged and thus exert repulsive electric forces on each other.\nSince stable nuclei do stay together, another force must be acting. This new force\nhas to be stronger than the electric force in order to hold the nucleus together, and\nis called the strong nuclear force. The strong nuclear force acts as an attractive\nforce between all nucleons, protons and neutrons alike. Thus protons attract\neach other via the strong nuclear force at the same time they repel each other\nvia the electric force. Neutrons, because they are electrically neutral, only attract\nother neutrons or protons via the strong nuclear force.\nThe strong nuclear force turns out to be far more complicated than the\ngravitational and electromagnetic forces. One important aspect of the strong\nnuclear force is that it is a short-range force: it acts only over a very short distance.\n862 CHAPTER 30 Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'It is very strong between two nucleons if they are less than about 10-15 m apart,\nbut it is essentially zero if they are separated by a distance greater than this.\nCompare this to electric and gravitational forces, which decrease as 1/r2 but\ncontinue acting over any distances and are therefore called long-range forces.\nThe strong nuclear force has some strange features. For example, if a nuclide\ncontains too many or too few neutrons relative to the number of protons, the\nbinding of the nucleons is reduced; nuclides that are too unbalanced in this\nregard are unstable. As shown in Fig. 30-2, stable nuclei tend to have the same\nnumber of protons as neutrons (N = Z) up to about A = 30. Beyond this,\nstable nuclei contain more neutrons than protons. This makes sense since, as Z\nincreases, the electrical repulsion increases, so a greater number of neutrons-\nwhich exert only the attractive strong nuclear force-are required to maintain\nstability. For very large Z, no number of neutrons can overcome the greatly\nincreased electric repulsion. Indeed, there are no completely stable nuclides\nabove Z = 82.\n-120\nStable\nnuclei\n- 100\n- 80\nNeutron number (N = A - Z)\nWhat we mean by a stable nucleus is one that stays together indefinitely. What\nthen is an unstable nucleus? It is one that comes apart; and this results in radioac-\ntive decay. Before we discuss the important subject of radioactivity (next Section),\nwe note that there is a second type of nuclear force that is much weaker than the\nstrong nuclear force. It is called the weak nuclear force, and we are aware of its\nexistence only because it shows itself in certain types of radioactive decay. These\ntwo nuclear forces, the strong and the weak, together with the gravitational and\nelectromagnetic forces, comprise the four fundamental types of force in nature.\n30-3 Radioactivity\nNuclear physics had its beginnings in 1896. In that year, Henri Becquerel\n(1852-1908) made an important discovery: in his studies of phosphorescence, he\nfound that a certain mineral (which happened to contain uranium) would darken\na photographic plate even when the plate was wrapped to exclude light. It was\nclear that the mineral emitted some new kind of radiation that, unlike X-rays\n(Section 25-11), occurred without any external stimulus. This new phenomenon\neventually came to be called radioactivity.\nSoon after Becquerel\'s discovery, Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband,\nPierre Curie (1859-1906), isolated two previously unknown elements that were\nvery highly radioactive (Fig. 30-3). These were named polonium and radium.\nOther radioactive elements were soon discovered as well. The radioactivity was\nfound in every case to be unaffected by the strongest physical and chemical\ntreatments, including strong heating or cooling or the action of strong chemicals.\nIt was suspected that the source of radioactivity must be deep within the atom,\ncoming from the nucleus. It became apparent that radioactivity is the result\nof the disintegration or decay of an unstable nucleus. Certain isotopes are not\nstable, and they decay with the emission of some type of radiation or "rays."\nMany unstable isotopes occur in nature, and such radioactivity is called\n"natural radioactivity." Other unstable isotopes can be produced in the laboratory\nby nuclear reactions (Section 31-1); these are said to be produced "artificially"\nand to have "artificial radioactivity." Radioactive isotopes are sometimes referred\nto as radioisotopes or radionuclides.\nRutherford and others began studying the nature of the rays emitted in\nradioactivity about 1898. They classified the rays into three distinct types accord-\ning to their penetrating power. One type of radiation could barely penetrate a\npiece of paper. The second type could pass through as much as 3 mm of aluminum.\nThe third was extremely penetrating: it could pass through several centimeters\nof lead and still be detected on the other side. They named these three types of\nradiation alpha (a), beta (B), and gamma (Y), respectively, after the first three\nletters of the Greek alphabet.\n+ 60\n+ 40\n+ 20\nN = Z\n0\nO\n20\n40\n60\n80\nProton number (Z)\nFIGURE 30-2 Number of neutrons\nversus number of protons for stable\nnuclides, which are represented by dots.\nThe straight line represents N = Z.\nFIGURE 30-3 Marie and Pierre\nCurie in their laboratory (about\n1906) where radium was discovered.\nSECTION 30-3 Radioactivity 863\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': "g\nX\nX\n×\nX\n×\nX\nX X\nxMagnetic field\nX(into page) ×\nFIGURE 30-4 Alpha and beta rays\nare bent in opposite directions by a\nmagnetic field, whereas gamma rays\nare not bent at all.\nFIGURE 30-5 Radioactive decay of\nradium to radon with emission of an\nalpha particle.\n138 (n\n88 (P\n226 Ra\n88 K\n136 n\n86\np\n222 Rn\n86\n2(n\n+\n2P\n4He\nXX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nax\nX\nXPx X X\nX\nX +X\nX\nLead block\nRadioactive\nsample (radium)\nEach type of ray was found to have a different charge and hence is bent dif-\nferently in a magnetic field, Fig. 30-4; a rays are positively charged, ß rays are\nnegatively charged, and Y rays are neutral. It was soon found that all three types\nof radiation consisted of familiar kinds of particles. Gamma rays are very high-\nenergy photons whose energy is even higher than that of X-rays. Beta rays were\nfound to be identical to electrons that orbit the nucleus, but they are created\nwithin the nucleus itself. Alpha rays (or a particles) are simply the nuclei of\nhelium atoms, 4He; that is, an a ray consists of two protons and two neutrons\nbound together.\nWe now discuss each of these three types of radioactivity, or decay, in more\ndetail.\n30-4 Alpha Decay\nExperiments show that when nuclei decay, the number of nucleons (= mass\nnumber A) is conserved, as well as electric charge (= Ze). When a nucleus emits\nan a particle (4He), the remaining nucleus will be different from the original: it\nhas lost two protons and two neutrons. Radium 226 (288Ra), for example, is an\na emitter. It decays to a nucleus with Z = 88 - 2 = 86 and A = 226 - 4 = 222.\nThe nucleus with Z = 86 is radon (Rn)-see Appendix B or the Periodic Table.\nThus radium decays to radon with the emission of an a particle. This is written\n226Ra\n881\n>\n23%Rn + 4He.\nSee Fig. 30-5.\nWhen a decay occurs, a different element is formed. The daughter nucleus\n(28%Rn in this case) is different from the parent nucleus (288Ra in this case). This\nchanging of one element into another is called transmutation of the elements.\nAlpha decay can be written in general as\nAN -> 2=4N' + 4He\n[a decay]\nwhere N is the parent, N' the daughter, and Z and A are the atomic number and\natomic mass number, respectively, of the parent.\n-\nEXERCISE C 154Dy decays by a emission to what element? (a) Pb, (b) Gd, (c) Sm,\n(d) Er, (e) Yb.\nAlpha decay occurs because the strong nuclear force is unable to hold very\nlarge nuclei together. The nuclear force is a short-range force: it acts only\nbetween neighboring nucleons. But the electric force acts all the way across a\nlarge nucleus. For very large nuclei, the large Z means the repulsive electric force\nbecomes so large (Coulomb's law) that the strong nuclear force is unable to hold\nthe nucleus together.\n864 CHAPTER 30 Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity\n", 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': "We can express the instability of the parent nucleus in terms of energy (or\nmass): the mass of the parent nucleus is greater than the mass of the daughter\nnucleus plus the mass of the a particle. The mass difference appears as kinetic\nenergy, which is carried away by the a particle and the recoiling daughter nucleus.\nThe total energy released is called the disintegration energy, Q, or the Q-value\nof the decay. From conservation of energy,\nMpc2 = MDC2 + mac2 + Q,\nwhere Q equals the kinetic energy of the daughter and a particle, and Mp, MD,\nand m2 are the masses of the parent, daughter, and a particle, respectively. Thus\nQ = Mpc2 - (Mp + ma)c2.\n(30-2)\nIf the parent had less mass than the daughter plus the a particle (so Q < 0), the\ndecay would violate conservation of energy. Such decays have never been\nobserved, another confirmation of this great conservation law.\nEXAMPLE 30-6\nUranium decay energy release.

After disintegration, the total vector momentum\nmust still be zero so the magnitude of the a particle's momentum must equal\nthe magnitude of the daughter's momentum (Fig. 30-6):\nma Va = mDUD.\nThus Va = mp Up/m2 and the a's kinetic energy is\nMD UD\n12\nmp\n2\nmp\nKEQ = 2ma v2 = }ma\nNA\nma\n=\nma\nKED\nma\n=\n4.002603 u\n228.028741 u\nKED = 57 KED .\nThe total disintegration energy is Q = KE2 + KED = 57 KED + KED = 58 KED·\nHence\nKEQ = 57 KED = ;\n58\n57\nQ = 5.3 MeV.\nparticle\nDaughter\nnucleus\nmava\nmDVD\nFIGURE 30-6 Momentum\nconservation in Example 30-7.\nThe lighter a particle carries off (57/58) or 98% of the total kinetic energy.

Why not just four separate nucleons, or even one? The answer is\nthat the a particle is very strongly bound, so that its mass is significantly less than\nthat of four separate nucleons. That helps the final state in « decay to have less\ntotal mass, thus allowing certain nuclides to decay which could not decay to,\nsay, 2 protons plus 2 neutrons. For example, 232U could not decay to 2p + 2n\nbecause the masses of the daughter 230Th plus four separate nucleons is\n228.028741 u + 2(1.007825 u) + 2(1.008665 u) = 232.061721 u, which is greater\nthan the mass of the 232U parent (232.037156 u). Such a decay would violate the\nconservation of energy. Indeed, we have never seen 232U -> 290Th + 2p + 2n.\nSimilarly, it is almost always true that the emission of a single nucleon is energet-\nically not possible; see Example 30-5.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nSmoke detector\nSmoke Detectors-An Application\nOne widespread application of nuclear physics is present in nearly every home in\nthe form of an ordinary smoke detector. One type of smoke detector contains\nabout 0.2 mg of the radioactive americium isotope, 241Am, in the form of\nAmO2. The radiation continually ionizes the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in\nthe air space between two oppositely charged plates. The resulting conductivity\nallows a small steady electric current. If smoke enters, the radiation is absorbed\nby the smoke particles rather than by the air molecules, thus reducing the current.\nThe current drop is detected by the device\'s electronics and sets off the alarm.\nThe radiation dose that escapes from an intact americium smoke detector is much\nless than the natural radioactive background, and so can be considered relatively\nharmless. There is no question that smoke detectors save lives and reduce property\ndamage.\nCAUTION\nB-decay e" comes from nucleus\n(it is not an orbital electron)\n30-5 Beta Decay\nß" Decay\nTransmutation of elements also occurs when a nucleus decays by ß decay-that\nis, with the emission of an electron or ( particle. The nucleus 14C, for example,\nemits an electron when it decays:\n14C -> 14N + e" + neutrino,\nwhere e" is the symbol for the electron. The particle known as the neutrino has\ncharge q = 0 and a very small mass, long thought to be zero. It was not initially\ndetected and was only later hypothesized to exist, as we shall discuss later in this\nSection. No nucleons are lost when an electron is emitted, and the total number\nof nucleons, A, is the same in the daughter nucleus as in the parent. But because\nan electron has been emitted from the nucleus itself, the charge on the daughter\nnucleus is +1e greater than that on the parent. The parent nucleus in the decay\nwritten above had Z = +6, so from charge conservation the nucleus remaining\nbehind must have a charge of +7e. So the daughter nucleus has Z = 7, which is\nnitrogen.\nIt must be carefully noted that the electron emitted in ß decay is not an orbital\nelectron. Instead, the electron is created within the nucleus itself. What happens is\nthat one of the neutrons changes to a proton and in the process (to conserve\ncharge) emits an electron. Indeed, free neutrons actually do decay in this fashion:\nn -> p + e + neutrino.\nTo remind us of their origin in the nucleus, the electrons emitted in ß decay are\noften referred to as "ß particles." They are, nonetheless, indistinguishable from\norbital electrons.\n866 CHAPTER 30 Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 30-8\nEnergy release in 14C decay. How much energy is released\nwhen 14C decays to 14N by ß emission?\nAPPROACH We find the mass difference before and after decay, Am. The energy\nreleased is E = (Am)c2. The masses given in Appendix B are those of the neutral\natom, and we have to keep track of the electrons involved. Assume the parent\nnucleus has six orbiting electrons so it is neutral; its mass is 14.003242 u. The\ndaughter in this decay, 14N, is not neutral because it has the same six orbital elec-\ntrons circling it but the nucleus has a charge of +7e. However, the mass of this\ndaughter with its six electrons, plus the mass of the emitted electron (which makes\na total of seven electrons), is just the mass of a neutral nitrogen atom.\nSOLUTION The total mass in the final state is\n(mass of 14N nucleus + 6 electrons) + (mass of 1 electron),\nand this is equal to\nmass of neutral 14N (includes 7 electrons),\nwhich from Appendix B is a mass of 14.003074 u. So the mass difference is\n14.003242 u - 14.003074 u = 0.000168 u, which is equivalent to an energy\nchange Am c2 = (0.000168 u)(931.5 MeV/u) = 0.156 MeV or 156 keV.\nNOTE The neutrino doesn\'t contribute to either the mass or charge balance\nbecause it has q = 0 and m ~ 0.\nAccording to Example 30-8, we would expect the emitted electron to have a\nkinetic energy of 156 keV. (The daughter nucleus, because its mass is very much\nlarger than that of the electron, recoils with very low velocity and hence gets very\nlittle of the kinetic energy-see Example 30-7.) Indeed, very careful measure-\nments indicate that a few emitted ß particles do have kinetic energy close to this\ncalculated value. But the vast majority of emitted electrons have somewhat less\nenergy. In fact, the energy of the emitted electron can be anywhere from zero up\nto the maximum value as calculated above. This range of electron kinetic energy\nwas found for any ß decay. It was as if the law of conservation of energy was\nbeing violated, and Bohr actually considered this possibility. Careful experiments\nindicated that linear momentum and angular momentum also did not seem to be\nconserved. Physicists were troubled at the prospect of giving up these laws, which\nhad worked so well in all previous situations.\nIn 1930, Wolfgang Pauli proposed an alternate solution: perhaps a new parti-\ncle that was very difficult to detect was emitted during ß decay in addition to the\nelectron. This hypothesized particle could be carrying off the energy, momentum,\nand angular momentum required to maintain the conservation laws. This new\nparticle was named the neutrino-meaning "little neutral one"-by the great\nItalian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901-1954; Fig. 30-7), who in 1934 worked out\na detailed theory of ß decay. (It was Fermi who, in this theory, postulated the\nexistence of the fourth force in nature which we call the weak nuclear force.) The\nneutrino has zero charge, spin of , and was long thought to have zero mass,\nalthough today we are quite sure that it has a very tiny mass (< 0.14 eV/c2). If its\nmass were zero, it would be much like a photon in that it is neutral and would\ntravel at the speed of light. But the neutrino is very difficult to detect. In 1956,\ncomplex experiments produced further evidence for the existence of the neutrino;\nbut by then, most physicists had already accepted its existence.\nThe symbol for the neutrino is the Greek letter nu (v). The correct way of\nwriting the decay of 14C is then\n14℃ ~> 14N + ++ + v.\nThe bar (-) over the neutrino symbol is to indicate that it is an "antineutrino."\n(Why this is called an antineutrino rather than simply a neutrino is discussed in\nChapter 32.)\nCAUTION\nBe careful with atomic and electron\nmasses in ß decay\nec\nk.E.\ntcp> F\nUSA Enrico\n34 Fermi\n2001\nFIGURE 30-7 Enrico Fermi, as\nportrayed on a US postage stamp.\nFermi contributed significantly to\nboth theoretical and experimental\nphysics, a feat almost unique in\nmodern times: statistical theory of\nidentical particles that obey the\nexclusion principle (= fermions);\ntheory of the weak interaction and\nß decay; neutron physics; induced\nradioactivity and new elements; first\nnuclear reactor; first resonance of\nparticle physics; led and inspired a\nvast amount of other nuclear\nresearch.\nSECTION 30-5 Beta Decay 867\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': '+ 120\nStable\nnuclei\n+100\n+ 80\nNeutron number (N=A -Z)\n+ 60\n+ 40\n-20\nN = Z\n0\n0\n-\n20\n40\n60\n80\nProton number (Z)\nFIGURE 30-2 (Repeated.)\nNumber of neutrons versus number\nof protons for stable nuclides, which\nare represented by dots.

The neu-\ntrino is unique in that it interacts with matter only via the weak force, which is\nwhy it is so hard to detect.\nB+ Decay\nMany isotopes decay by electron emission. They are always isotopes that have\ntoo many neutrons compared to the number of protons. That is, they are isotopes\nthat lie above the stable isotopes plotted in Fig. 30-2. But what about unstable\nisotopes that have too few neutrons compared to their number of protons-\nthose that fall below the stable isotopes of Fig. 30-2? These, it turns out, decay by\nemitting a positron instead of an electron. A positron (sometimes called an e+ or\nB+ particle) has the same mass as the electron, but it has a positive charge of +1e.\nBecause it is so like an electron, except for its charge, the positron is called the\nantiparticle* to the electron. An example of a B+ decay is that of 10Ne:\n18Ne -> 19F + e+ + v,\nwhere e+ stands for a positron. Note that the v emitted here is a neutrino,\nwhereas that emitted in B" decay is called an antineutrino. Thus an antielectron\n(= positron) is emitted with a neutrino, whereas an antineutrino is emitted with\nan electron; this gives a certain balance as discussed in Chapter 32.\nWe can write B and B+ decay, in general, as follows:\nAN -> 2+1N\' + e + v\n[B decay]\n[B+ decay]\nAN -> 2-1N\' + e+ + v,\nwhere N is the parent nucleus and N\' is the daughter.\nElectron Capture\nBesides B and B+ emission, there is a third related process. This is electron\ncapture (abbreviated EC in Appendix B) and occurs when a nucleus absorbs one\nof its orbiting electrons. An example is 2Be, which as a result becomes 3Li. The\nprocess is written\nZBe + e -> 3Li + v,\nor, in general,\nAN + e- > 2-1N\' + v.\n[electron capture]\nUsually it is an electron in the innermost (K) shell that is captured, in which case\nthe process is called K-capture. The electron disappears in the process, and a\nproton in the nucleus becomes a neutron; a neutrino is emitted as a result. This\nprocess is inferred experimentally by detection of emitted X-rays (due to other\nelectrons jumping down to fill the state of the captured e").\n30-6 Gamma Decay\nGamma rays are photons having very high energy. They have their origin in the\ndecay of a nucleus, much like emission of photons by excited atoms. Like an\natom, a nucleus itself can be in an excited state. When it jumps down to a lower\nenergy state, or to the ground state, it emits a photon which we call a Y ray. The\npossible states of a nucleus are much farther apart in energy than those of an atom:\non the order of keV or MeV, as compared to a few eV for electrons in an atom.\nHence, the emitted photons have energies that can range from a few keV to\nseveral MeV. For a given decay, the Y ray always has the same energy. Since a\nY ray carries no charge, there is no change in the element as a result of a Y decay.\nHow does a nucleus get into an excited state? It may occur because of a vio-\nlent collision with another particle. More commonly, the nucleus remaining after\na previous radioactive decay may be in an excited state. A typical example is shown\n+Discussed in Chapter 32. Briefly, an antiparticle has the same mass as its corresponding particle, but\nopposite charge. A particle and its antiparticle can quickly annihilate each other, releasing energy\nin the form of two Y rays: e+ + e" -> 2y.\n868 CHAPTER 30 Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'in the energy-level diagram of Fig. 30-8. 13B can decay by ß decay directly to the\nground state of 12C; or it can go by B decay to an excited state of 12C, written 12C*,\nwhich itself decays by emission of a 4.4-MeV Y ray to the ground state of 12C.\nWe can write Y decay as\nAN* - > AN + Y,\n[Y decay]\nwhere the asterisk means "excited state" of that nucleus.\nWhat, you may wonder, is the difference between a Y ray and an X-ray? They\nboth are electromagnetic radiation (photons) and, though Y rays usually have\nhigher energy than X-rays, their range of energies overlap to some extent. The\ndifference is not intrinsic. We use the term X-ray if the photon is produced by an\nelectron-atom interaction, and Y ray if the photon is produced in a nuclear process.\n* Isomers; Internal Conversion\nIn some cases, a nucleus may remain in an excited state for some time before it\nemits a Y ray. The nucleus is then said to be in a metastable state and is called an\nisomer.\nAn excited nucleus can sometimes return to the ground state by another\nprocess known as internal conversion with no Y ray emitted. In this process, the\nexcited nucleus interacts with one of the orbital electrons and ejects this electron\nfrom the atom with the same kinetic energy (minus the binding energy of the\nelectron) that an emitted Y ray would have had.\n30-7\nConservation of Nucleon Number\nand Other Conservation Laws\nIn all three types of radioactive decay, the classical conservation laws hold.\nEnergy, linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge are all\nconserved. These quantities are the same before the decay as after. But a new\nconservation law is also revealed, the law of conservation of nucleon number.\nAccording to this law, the total number of nucleons (A) remains constant in any\nprocess, although one type can change into the other type (protons into neutrons\nor vice versa). This law holds in all three types of decay. [In Chapter 32 we will\ngeneralize this and call it conservation of baryon number.]\nTable 30-2 gives a summary of a, B, and Y decay.\n30-8 Half-Life and Rate of Decay\nA macroscopic sample of any radioactive isotope consists of a vast number of\nradioactive nuclei. These nuclei do not all decay at one time. Rather, they decay\none by one over a period of time. This is a random process: we can not predict\nexactly when a given nucleus will decay. But we can determine, on a probabilistic\nbasis, approximately how many nuclei in a sample will decay over a given time\nperiod, by assuming that each nucleus has the same probability of decaying in\neach second that it exists.\nThe number of decays AN that occur in a very short time interval At is then\nproportional to At and to the total number N of radioactive (parent) nuclei\npresent:\nAN = - AN At\n(30-3a)\nwhere the minus sign means N is decreasing. We rewrite this to get the rate of\ndecay (number of decays per second):\nAN\n= - AN.\n(30-3b)\nAt\nIn these equations, À is a measurable constant called the decay constant, which\nis different for different isotopes.

The activity of a pure sample at\ntime t is\nR = AN = Roe - ,\n(30-5)\nwhere Ro = JAN/Atlo is the activity at t = 0.\nEquation 30-5 is also referred to as the radioactive decay law (as is\nEq. 30-4).\nHalf-Life\nThe rate of decay of any isotope is often specified by giving its "half-life" rather\nthan the decay constant À. The half-life of an isotope is defined as the time it\ntakes for half the original amount of parent isotope in a given sample to decay.\n870 CHAPTER 30 Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'For example, the half-life of 14C is about 5730 years.

One\nmight think that a short half-life material is safer than a long half-life material\nbecause it will not last as long. Is that true?\nRESPONSE No. A shorter half-life means the activity is higher and thus more\n"radioactive" and can cause more biological damage. In contrast, a longer half-life\nfor the same sample size N means a lower activity but we have to worry about it\nfor longer and find safe storage until it reaches a safe (low) level of activity.\nEXAMPLE 30-11\nA sample of radioactive 13N.

Sometimes this daughter decays to yet a third isotope which also\nis radioactive. Such successive decays are said to form a decay series. An important\nexample is illustrated in Fig. 30-11. As can be seen, 232U decays by a emission to\n290Th, which in turn decays by ß decay to 234Pa. The series continues as shown,\nwith several possible branches near the bottom, ending at the stable lead isotope,\n82Pb.

When the solar system (including Earth)\nwas formed about 5 billion years ago, it is believed that nearly all nuclides were\npresent, having been formed (by fusion and neutron capture, Sections 31-3 and\n33-2) in a nearby supernova explosion (Section 33-2). Many isotopes with short\nhalf-lives decayed quickly and no longer are detected in nature today. But\nlong-lived isotopes, such as 232U with a half-life of 4.5 × 109 yr, still do exist in\nnature today. Indeed, about half of the original 232U still remains. We might\nexpect, however, that radium (28gRa), with a half-life of 1600 yr, would have\ndisappeared from the Earth long ago. Indeed, the original 239Ra nuclei must\nby now have all decayed. However, because 232U decays (in several steps,\nFig. 30-11) to 288Ra, the supply of 286Ra is continually replenished, which is why\nit is still found on Earth today. The same can be said for many other radioactive\nnuclides.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 30-12\nDecay chain. In the decay chain of\nFig. 30-11, if we look at the decay of 292U, we see four successive nuclides with\nhalf-lives of 250,000 yr, 75,000 yr, 1600 yr, and a little under 4 days. Each decay\nin the chain has an alpha particle of a characteristic energy, and so we can\nmonitor the radioactive decay rate of each nuclide. Given a sample that was\npure 292U a million years ago, which alpha decay would you expect to have the\nhighest activity rate in the sample?\nRESPONSE The first instinct is to say that the process with the shortest half-\nlife would show the highest activity. Surprisingly, perhaps, the activities of the\nfour nuclides in this sample are all the same. The reason is that in each case the\ndecay of the parent acts as a bottleneck to the decay of the daughter. Compared\nto the 1600-yr half-life of 239Ra, for example, its daughter 232Rn decays almost\nimmediately, but it cannot decay until it is made. (This is like an automobile\nassembly line: if worker A takes 20 minutes to do a task and then worker B\ntakes only 1 minute to do the next task, worker B still does only one car every\n20 minutes.)\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nCarbon-14 dating\n30-11 Radioactive Dating\nRadioactive decay has many interesting applications. One is the technique of\nradioactive dating by which the age of ancient materials can be determined.\nThe age of any object made from once-living matter, such as wood, can be\ndetermined using the natural radioactivity of 14C. All living plants absorb carbon\ndioxide (CO2) from the air and use it to synthesize organic molecules. The vast\nmajority of these carbon atoms are 12C, but a small fraction, about 1.3 × 10-12,\nis the radioactive isotope 14C. The ratio of 14C to 12C in the atmosphere has\nremained roughly constant over many thousands of years, in spite of the fact that\n14C decays with a half-life of about 5730 yr. This is because energetic nuclei in the\ncosmic radiation, which impinges on the Earth from outer space, strike nuclei of\natoms in the atmosphere and break those nuclei into pieces, releasing free\nneutrons. Those neutrons can collide with nitrogen nuclei in the atmosphere to\nproduce the nuclear transformation n + 14N -> 14C + p. That is, a neutron\nstrikes and is absorbed by a 14N nucleus, and a proton is knocked out in the\nprocess. The remaining nucleus is 14C. This continual production of 14C in the\natmosphere roughly balances the loss of 14C by radioactive decay.\nAs long as a plant or tree is alive, it continually uses the carbon from carbon\ndioxide in the air to build new tissue and to replace old. Animals eat plants, so\nthey too are continually receiving a fresh supply of carbon for their tissues.\n874 CHAPTER 30 Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Organisms cannot distinguish+ 14C from 12C, and because the ratio of 14C to 12C\nin the atmosphere remains nearly constant, the ratio of the two isotopes within\nthe living organism remains nearly constant as well. When an organism dies,\ncarbon dioxide is no longer taken in and utilized. Because the 14C decays\nradioactively, the ratio of 14C to 12C in a dead organism decreases over time. The\nhalf-life of 14C is about 5730 yr, so the 14C/12C ratio decreases by half every\n5730 yr. If, for example, the 14C/12C ratio of an ancient wooden tool is half of\nwhat it is in living trees, then the object must have been made from a tree that\nwas felled about 5730 years ago.\nActually, corrections must be made for the fact that the 14C/12C ratio in the\natmosphere has not remained precisely constant over time. The determination of\nwhat this ratio has been over the centuries has required techniques such as com-\nparing the expected ratio to the actual ratio for objects whose age is known, such\nas very old trees whose annual rings can be counted reasonably accurately.\nEXAMPLE 30-13\nAn ancient animal. The mass of carbon in an animal bone\nfragment found in an archeological site is 200 g. If the bone registers an activity\nof 16 decays/s, what is its age?\nAPPROACH First we determine how many 14C atoms there were in our 200-g\nsample when the animal was alive, given the known fraction of 14℃ to 12C,\n1.3 × 10-12. Then we use Eq. 30-3b to find the activity back then, and Eq. 30-5\nto find out how long ago that was by solving for the time t.\nSOLUTION The 200 g of carbon is nearly all 12C; 12.0 g of 12C contains\n6.02 × 1023 atoms, so 200 g contains\n12.0 g/mol\n6.02 × 1023 atoms/mol\n(200 g) = 1.00 × 1025 atoms.\nWhen the animal was alive, the ratio of 14C to 12C in the bone was 1.3 × 10-12.\nThe number of 14C nuclei at that time was\nNo= (1.00×1025 atoms)(1.3×10-12)= 1.3× 1013 atoms.\nFrom Eq. 30-3b with À = 3.83 × 10-12 s-1 (Example 30-9) the magnitude of\nthe activity when the animal was still alive (t = 0) was\no = = ANO = (3.83 X 10-12 5-1)(1.3 X 1013) = 50s-1.\nAt lo\nFrom Eq. 30-5\nR = Roe-N\nwhere R, its activity now, is given as 16 s-1.

The amount of 14C remaining in objects older than that is usually\ntoo small to measure accurately, although new techniques are allowing detection\nof even smaller amounts of 14C, pushing the time frame further back. On the other\nhand, radioactive isotopes with longer half-lives can be used in certain circum-\nstances to obtain the age of older objects. For example, the decay of 232U, because\nof its long half-life of 4.5 × 109 years, is useful in determining the ages of rocks\non a geologic time scale. When molten material on Earth long ago solidified into\nrock as the temperature dropped, different compounds solidified according to the\nmelting points, and thus different compounds separated to some extent. Uranium\npresent in a material became fixed in position and the daughter nuclei that result\nfrom the decay of uranium were also fixed in that position. Thus, by measuring\nthe amount of 292U remaining in the material relative to the amount of daughter\nnuclei, the time when the rock solidified can be determined.\nRadioactive dating methods using 232U and other isotopes have shown the\nage of the oldest Earth rocks to be about 4 × 109 yr. The age of rocks in which\nthe oldest fossilized organisms are embedded indicates that life appeared more\nthan 32 billion years ago. The earliest fossilized remains of mammals are found in\nrocks 200 million years old, and humanlike creatures seem to have appeared\nmore than 2 million years ago. Radioactive dating has been indispensable for the\nreconstruction of Earth\'s history.\n*\n30-12 Stability and Tunneling\nr\nRadioactive decay occurs only if the mass of the parent nucleus is greater than\nthe sum of the masses of the daughter nucleus and all particles emitted. For\nexample, 92\n238U can decay to 238Th because the mass of 232U is greater than the\nmass of the 230Th plus the mass of the a particle. Because systems tend to go in\nthe direction that reduces their internal or potential energy (a ball rolls downhill,\na positive charge moves toward a negative charge), you may wonder why an\nunstable nucleus doesn\'t fall apart immediately. In other words, why do 238U\nnuclei (T) = 4.5 × 109 yr) and other isotopes have such long half-lives? Why\ndon\'t parent nuclei all decay at once?\nQ\n0\nR0\nA\nB\nC\nFIGURE 30-12 Potential energy for\nalpha particle and nucleus, showing\nthe "Coulomb barrier" through\nwhich the a particle must tunnel to\nescape. The Q-value of the reaction\nis also indicated.\nThe answer has to do with quantum theory and the nature of the forces\ninvolved. One way to view the situation is with the aid of a potential-energy\ndiagram, as in Fig. 30-12. Let us consider the particular case of the decay\n238U -> 238Th + 4He. The blue line represents the potential energy, including\nrest mass, where we imagine the a particle as a separate entity within the 238U\nnucleus. The region labeled A in Fig. 30-12 represents the PE of the a particle\nwhen it is held within the uranium nucleus by the strong nuclear force ( R0 is the\nnuclear radius). Region C represents the PE when the a particle is free of the\nnucleus. The downward-curving PE (proportional to 1/r) represents the electrical\nrepulsion (Coulomb\'s law) between the positively charged a and the 230Th nucleus.\nTo get to region C, the a particle has to get through the "Coulomb barrier" shown.\nSince the PE just beyond r = R0 (region B) is greater than the energy of the\nalpha particle (dashed line), the a particle could not escape the nucleus if it were\ngoverned by classical physics. It could escape only if there were an input of energy\nequal to the height of the barrier. Nuclei decay spontaneously, however, without\nany input of energy. How, then, does the a particle get from region A to region C?\nIt actually passes through the barrier in a process known as quantum-mechanical\ntunneling. Classically, this could not happen, because an a particle in region B\n(within the barrier) would be violating the conservation-of-energy principle.+\n*The total energy E (dashed line in Fig. 30-12) would be less than the PE; because KE = 2mv2 > 0,\nthen classically, E = KE + PE could not be less than the PE.\n876 CHAPTER 30 Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The uncertainty principle, however, tells us that energy conservation can be\nviolated by an amount AE for a length of time At given by\n(AE)(At) ~\nh\nh.\nWe saw in Section 28-3 that this is a result of the wave-particle duality. Thus\nquantum mechanics allows conservation of energy to be violated for brief\nperiods that may be long enough for an a particle to "tunnel" through the barrier.\nAE would represent the energy difference between the average barrier height\nand the particle\'s energy, and At the time to pass through the barrier. The higher\nand wider the barrier, the less time the a particle has to escape and the less likely\nit is to do so. It is therefore the height and width of this barrier that control the\nrate of decay and half-life of an isotope.\n30-13 Detection of Particles\nIndividual particles such as electrons, protons, a particles, neutrons, and Y rays\nare not detected directly by our senses. Consequently, a variety of instruments\nhave been developed to detect them.\nCounters\nOne of the most common detectors is the Geiger counter. As shown in Fig. 30-13,\nit consists of a cylindrical metal tube filled with a certain type of gas. A long\nwire runs down the center and is kept at a high positive voltage (~ 103 V) with\nrespect to the outer cylinder. The voltage is just slightly less than that required\nto ionize the gas atoms. When a charged particle enters through the thin "window"\nat one end of the tube, it ionizes a few atoms of the gas. The freed electrons are\nattracted toward the positive wire, and as they are accelerated they strike and\nionize additional atoms. An "avalanche" of electrons is quickly produced, and\nwhen it reaches the wire anode, it produces a voltage pulse. The pulse, after being\namplified, can be sent to an electronic counter, which counts how many particles\nhave been detected. Or the pulses can be sent to a loudspeaker and each detec-\ntion of a particle is heard as a "click." Only a fraction of the radiation emitted\nby a sample is detected by any detector.\nA scintillation counter makes use of a solid, liquid, or gas known as a\nscintillator or phosphor. The atoms of a scintillator are easily excited when struck\nby an incoming particle and emit visible light when they return to their ground\nstates. Typical scintillators are crystals of NaI and certain plastics. One face of a\nsolid scintillator is cemented to a photomultiplier tube, and the whole is wrapped\nwith opaque material to keep it light-tight (in the dark) or is placed within a light-\ntight container. The photomultiplier (PM) tube converts the energy of the\nscintillator-emitted photon(s) into an electric signal. A PM tube is a vacuum\ntube containing several electrodes (typically 8 to 14), called dynodes, which are\nmaintained at successively higher voltages as shown in Fig. 30-14. At its top\nsurface is a photoelectric surface, called the photocathode, whose work function\n(Section 27-3) is low enough that an electron is easily released when struck by a\nphoton from the scintillator. Such an electron is accelerated toward the positive\nvoltage of the first dynode. When it strikes the first dynode, the electron has\nacquired sufficient kinetic energy so that it can eject two to five more electrons.\nThese, in turn, are accelerated toward the higher voltage second dynode, and a\nmultiplication process begins. The number of electrons striking the last dynode\nmay be 106 or more. Thus the passage of a particle through the scintillator results\nin an electric signal at the output of the PM tube that can be sent to an electronic\ncounter just as for a Geiger tube. Solid scintillators are much more dense than\nthe gas of a Geiger counter, and so are much more efficient detectors-especially\nfor Y rays, which interact less with matter than do a or B particles.

Figure 32-15 in\nChapter 32 was made with this\ndetector.\nIn tracer work (Section 31-7), liquid scintillators are often used. Radioactive\nsamples taken at different times or from different parts of an organism are placed\ndirectly in small bottles containing the liquid scintillator. This is particularly con-\nvenient for detection of B rays from 3H and 14C, which have very low energies\nand have difficulty passing through the outer covering of a crystal scintillator or\nGeiger tube. A PM tube is still used to produce the electric signal from the liquid\nscintillator.\nA semiconductor detector consists of a reverse-biased pn junction diode\n(Section 29-9). A charged particle passing through the junction can excite electrons\ninto the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band. The freed charges\nproduce a short electric current pulse that can be counted as for Geiger and\nscintillation counters.\nHospital workers and others who work around radiation may carry film badges\nwhich detect the accumulation of radiation exposure. The film inside is periodically\nreplaced and developed, the darkness of the developed film being related to total\nexposure (see Section 31-5).\nVisualization\nThe devices discussed so far are used for counting the number of particles (or\ndecays of a radioactive isotope). There are also devices that allow the track of\ncharged particles to be seen. Very important are semiconductor detectors. Silicon\nwafer semiconductors have their surface etched into separate tiny pixels, each\nproviding particle position information. They are much used in elementary par-\nticle physics (Chapter 32) to track the positions of particles produced and to\ndetermine their point of origin and/or their momentum (with the help of a\nmagnetic field). The pixel arrangement can be CCD or CMOS (Section 25-1),\nthe latter able to incorporate electronics inside, allowing fast readout.\nOne of the oldest tracking devices is the photographic emulsion, which can\nbe small and portable, used now particularly for cosmic-ray studies from balloons.\nA charged particle passing through an emulsion ionizes the atoms along its path.\nThese points undergo a chemical change, and when the emulsion is developed\n(like film) the particle\'s path is revealed.\nIn a cloud chamber, used in the early days of nuclear physics, a gas is cooled\nto a temperature slightly below its usual condensation point ("supercooled").\nTiny droplets form around ions produced when a charged particle passes through\n(Fig. 30-15). Light scattering from these droplets reveals the track of the particle.\nThe bubble chamber, invented in 1952 by Donald A. Glaser (1926-2013),\nmakes use of a superheated liquid kept close to its normal boiling point. Bubbles\ncharacteristic of boiling form around ions produced by the passage of a charged\nparticle, revealing paths of particles that recently passed through. Because a\nbubble chamber uses a liquid, often liquid hydrogen, many more interactions can\noccur than in a cloud chamber. A magnetic field applied across the chamber\nmakes charged particle paths curve (Chapter 20) and allows the momentum of\ncharged particles to be determined from the radius of curvature of their paths.\nA multiwiret chamber consists of a set of closely spaced fine wires immersed in\na gas (Fig. 30-16). Many wires are grounded, and the others between are kept at\nvery high voltage. A charged particle passing through produces ions in the\ngas. Freed electrons drift toward the nearest high voltage wire, creating an\n"avalanche" of many more ions, and producing an electric pulse or signal at that\nwire. The positions of the particles are determined electronically by the position\nof the wire and by the time it takes the pulses to reach "readout" electronics at\nthe ends of the wires. The paths of the particles are reconstructed electronically\nby computers which can "draw" a picture of the tracks, as shown in Fig. 32-15,\nChapter 32. An external magnetic field curves the paths, allowing the momentum\nof the particles to be measured.\nMany detectors are also calorimeters which measure the energy of the\nparticles.\n+ Also called wire drift chamber or wire proportional chamber.\n878 CHAPTER 30\n', 'chapter_title': 'Nuclear Physics and Radioactivity'}, {'page_number': 23, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Summary\nNuclear physics is the study of atomic nuclei. Nuclei contain\nprotons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons.\nThe total number of nucleons, A, is the nucleus\'s atomic mass\nnumber. The number of protons, Z, is the atomic number. The\nnumber of neutrons equals A - Z. Isotopes are nuclei with\nthe same Z, but with different numbers of neutrons. For an\nelement X, an isotope of given Z and A is represented by\nAX.\nThe nuclear radius is approximately proportional to A3,\nindicating that all nuclei have about the same density. Nuclear\nmasses are specified in unified atomic mass units (u), where\nthe mass of 12C (including its 6 electrons) is defined as exactly\n12.000000 u. In terms of the energy equivalent (because\nE = mc2),\n1u = 931.5 MeV/c2 = 1.66 × 10-27 kg.\nThe mass of a stable nucleus is less than the sum of the\nmasses of its constituent nucleons. The difference in mass\n(times c2) is the total binding energy. It represents the energy\nneeded to break the nucleus into its constituent nucleons.\nThe binding energy per nucleon averages about 8 MeV per\nnucleon, and is lowest for low mass and high mass nuclei.\nUnstable nuclei undergo radioactive decay; they change\ninto other nuclei with the emission of an a, B, or Y particle.\nAn a particle is a 4He nucleus; a ß particle is an electron or\npositron; and a Y ray is a high-energy photon. In ß decay,\na neutrino is also emitted. The transformation of parent nuclei\ninto daughter nuclei is called transmutation of the elements.\nRadioactive decay occurs spontaneously only when the mass\nof the products is less than the mass of the parent nucleus.\nThe loss in mass appears as kinetic energy of the products.\nNuclei are held together by the strong nuclear force. The\nweak nuclear force makes itself apparent in ß decay. These two\nforces, plus the gravitational and electromagnetic forces, are\nthe four known types of force.\nQuestions\n1. What do different isotopes of a given element have in\ncommon? How are they different?\n2. What are the elements represented by the X in the follow-\ning: (a) 232X; (b) 18X; (c) 1X; (d) 36X; (e) 100X?\n3. How many protons and how many neutrons do each of the\nisotopes in Question 2 have?\n4. Identify the element that has 87 nucleons and 50 neutrons.\n5. Why are the atomic masses of many elements (see the\nPeriodic Table) not close to whole numbers?\n6. Why are atoms much more likely to emit an alpha particle\nthan to emit separate neutrons and protons?\n7. What are the similarities and the differences between the\nstrong nuclear force and the electric force?\n8. What is the experimental evidence in favor of radioactivity\nbeing a nuclear process?\n9. The isotope 2Cu is unusual in that it can decay by Y, ß ,\nand B+ emission. What is the resulting nuclide for each case?\n10. A 232U nucleus decays via a decay to a nucleus containing\nhow many neutrons?\nElectric charge, linear and angular momentum, mass-energy,\nand nucleon number are conserved in all decays.\nRadioactive decay is a statistical process. For a given type\nof radioactive nucleus, the number of nuclei that decay (AN)\nin a time At is proportional to the number N of parent nuclei\npresent:\nΔΝ = - λΝ Δt;\n(30-3a)\nthe minus sign means N decreases in time.\nThe proportionality constant À is called the decay constant\nand is characteristic of the given nucleus. The number N of\nnuclei remaining after a time t decreases exponentially,\nN = Noe-M,\n(30-4)\nas does the activity, R = magnitude of AN/At:\nR = AN e-M .\nAt lo\n(30-5)\nThe half-life, T1, is the time required for half the nuclei of a\nradioactive sample to decay. It is related to the decay constant\nby\nThị = 0.693\n(30-6)\nRadioactive dating is the use of radioactive decay to deter-\nmine the age of certain objects, such as carbon dating.\n[*Alpha decay occurs via a purely quantum-mechanical\nprocess called tunneling through a barrier.]\nParticle detectors include Geiger counters, scintillators\nwith attached photomultiplier tubes, and semiconductor\ndetectors. Detectors that can image particle tracks include\nsemiconductors, photographic emulsions, bubble chambers,\nand multiwire chambers.\n11.

Immediately after a 92l\n238U nucleus decays to 290Th + 4He,\nthe daughter thorium nucleus may still have 92 electrons\ncircling it. Since thorium normally holds only 90 electrons,\nwhat do you suppose happens to the two extra ones?\n14. When a nucleus undergoes either ß" or B+ decay, what hap-\npens to the energy levels of the atomic electrons? What is\nlikely to happen to these electrons following the decay?\n15. The alpha particles from a given alpha-emitting nuclide\nare generally monoenergetic; that is, they all have the same\nkinetic energy.

If the potassium isotope 18K gives 42 decays/s in a liter of\nmilk, estimate how much 49K and regular 33K are in a liter\nof milk. Use Appendix B.\n64. Strontium-90 is produced as a nuclear fission product of\nuranium in both reactors and atomic bombs. Look at its\nlocation in the Periodic Table to see what other elements it\nmight be similar to chemically, and tell why you think it\nmight be dangerous to ingest. It has too many neutrons to\nbe stable, and it decays with a half-life of about 29 yr. How\nlong will we have to wait for the amount of 39Sr on the\nEarth\'s surface to reach 1% of its current level, assuming\nno new material is scattered about? Write down the decay\nreaction, including the daughter nucleus. The daughter is\nradioactive: write down its decay.\n65.

Use Fig. 30-1 to estimate the total binding energy for\ncopper and then estimate the energy, in joules, needed to\nbreak a 3.0-g copper penny into its constituent nucleons.\n69. Instead of giving atomic masses for nuclides as in\nAppendix B, some Tables give the mass excess, 4, defined\nas A = M - A, where A is the atomic mass number and\nM is the mass in u. Determine the mass excess, in u and in\nMeV/c2, for: (a) 4He; (b) 12C; (c) §§Sr; (d) 232U. (e) From\na glance at Appendix B, can you make a generalization\nabout the sign of 4 as a function of Z or A?\n70. When water is placed near an intense neutron source, the\nneutrons can be slowed down to almost zero speed by col-\nlisions with the water molecules, and are eventually\ncaptured by a hydrogen nucleus to form the stable isotope\ncalled deuterium, 7H, giving off a gamma ray. What is the\nenergy of the gamma ray?\n71. The practical limit for carbon-14 dating is about 60,000 years.\nIf a bone contains 1.0 kg of carbon, and the animal died\n60,000 years ago, what is the activity today?\n72. Using Section 30-2 and Appendix B, determine the energy\nrequired to remove one neutron from 4He. How many times\ngreater is this energy than the binding energy of the last\nneutron in 13C?\n73. (a) If all of the atoms of the Earth were to collapse and\nsimply become nuclei, what would be the Earth\'s new\nradius? (b) If all of the atoms of the Sun were to collapse\nand simply become nuclei, what would be the Sun\'s new\nradius?\n74. (a) A 72-gram sample of natural carbon contains the usual\nfraction of 14C. Estimate roughly how long it will take\nbefore there is only one 14C nucleus left. (b) How does the\nanswer in (a) change if the sample is 340 grams? What\ndoes this tell you about the limits of carbon dating?\n75. If the mass of the proton were just a little closer to the\nmass of the neutron, the following reaction would be pos-\nsible even at low collision energies:\ne" + p -> n + v.\n(a) Why would this situation be catastrophic? (See last\nparagraph of Chapter 33.) (b) By what percentage would\nthe proton\'s mass have to be increased to make this reaction\npossible?\n77. Almost all of naturally occurring uranium is 92U\n238U with a\nhalf-life of 4.468 × 109 yr. Most of the rest of natural\nuranium is 235U with a half-life of 7.04 × 108 yr.

Some radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are greater\nthan the age of the universe (like gadolinium or samarium).\nThe only way to determine these half-lives is to monitor\nthe decay rate of a sample that contains these isotopes.
