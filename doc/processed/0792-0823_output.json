One apparatus, diagrammed in\nFig. 27-1, was a glass tube fitted with electrodes and evacuated so only a small\namount of gas remained inside. When a very high voltage was applied to the\nelectrodes, a dark space seemed to extend outward from the cathode (negative\nelectrode) toward the opposite end of the tube; and that far end of the tube would\nglow. If one or more screens containing a small hole were inserted as shown,\nthe glow was restricted to a tiny spot on the end of the tube. It seemed as though\nsomething being emitted by the cathode traveled across to the opposite end of the\ntube. These "somethings" were named cathode rays.\nThere was much discussion at the time about what these rays might be. Some\nscientists thought they might resemble light. But the observation that the bright\nspot at the end of the tube could be deflected to one side by an electric or magnetic\nfield suggested that cathode rays were charged particles; and the direction of the\ndeflection was consistent with a negative charge. Furthermore, if the tube con-\ntained certain types of rarefied gas, the path of the cathode rays was made visible\nby a slight glow.\nEstimates of the charge e of the cathode-ray particles, as well as of their\ncharge-to-mass ratio e/m, had been made by 1897. But in that year, J. J. Thomson\n(1856-1940) was able to measure e/m directly, using the apparatus shown in\nFig. 27-2. Cathode rays are accelerated by a high voltage and then pass between\na pair of parallel plates built into the tube. Another voltage applied to the\nparallel plates produces an electric field E, and a pair of coils produces a\nmagnetic field B. If E = B = 0, the cathode rays follow path b in Fig. 27-2.\n+\nI\na\nI\nAnode\n+\n+\nFIGURE 27-2 Cathode rays\ndeflected by electric and magnetic\nfields.

If only a magnetic\nfield exists, say inward, the rays are deflected downward along path c. These\nobservations are just what is expected for a negatively charged particle. The force\non the rays due to the magnetic field is F = evB, where e is the charge and v is\nthe velocity of the cathode rays (Eq. 20-4).

We equate\nthe two forces, eE = evB, and find\nv = E.\nE\nB\nCombining this with the above equation we have\n(27-1)\nm\ne = E .\nB2r\nThe quantities on the right side can all be measured, and although e and m could\nnot be determined separately, the ratio e/m could be determined. The accepted\nvalue today is e/m = 1.76 × 1011 C/kg. Cathode rays soon came to be called\nelectrons.\nDiscovery in Science\nThe "discovery" of the electron, like many others in science, is not quite so\nobvious as discovering gold or oil. Should the discovery of the electron be credited\nto the person who first saw a glow in the tube? Or to the person who first called\nthem cathode rays? Perhaps neither one, for they had no conception of the electron\nas we know it today. In fact, the credit for the discovery is generally given to\nThomson, but not because he was the first to see the glow in the tube. Rather it\nis because he believed that this phenomenon was due to tiny negatively charged\nparticles and made careful measurements on them. Furthermore he argued that\nthese particles were constituents of atoms, and not ions or atoms themselves as\nmany thought, and he developed an electron theory of matter. His view is close to\nwhat we accept today, and this is why Thomson is credited with the "discovery."\nNote, however, that neither he nor anyone else ever actually saw an electron itself.\nWe discuss this briefly, for it illustrates the fact that discovery in science is not\nalways a clear-cut matter. In fact some philosophers of science think the word\n"discovery" is often not appropriate, such as in this case.\nElectron Charge Measurement\nThomson believed that an electron was not an atom, but rather a constituent,\nor part, of an atom. Convincing evidence for this came soon with the determin-\nation of the charge and the mass of the cathode rays. Thomson\'s student\nJ. S. Townsend made the first direct (but rough) measurements of e in 1897. But\nit was the more refined oil-drop experiment of Robert A. Millikan (1868-1953)\nthat yielded a precise value for the charge on the electron and showed that charge\ncomes in discrete amounts. In this experiment, tiny droplets of mineral oil carrying\nan electric charge were allowed to fall under gravity between two parallel plates,\nFig. 27-3. The electric field E between the plates was adjusted until the drop was\nsuspended in midair. The downward pull of gravity, mg, was then just balanced by\nthe upward force due to the electric field. Thus qE = mg so the charge q = mg/E.\nThe mass of the droplet was determined by measuring its terminal velocity in the\nabsence of the electric field. Often the droplet was charged negatively, but some-\ntimes it was positive, suggesting that the droplet had acquired or lost electrons (by\nfriction, leaving the atomizer). Millikan\'s painstaking observations and analysis pre-\nsented convincing evidence that any charge was an integral multiple of a smallest\ncharge, e, that was ascribed to the electron, and that the value of e was 1.6 × 10-19 C.\nThis value of e, combined with the measurement of e/m, gives the mass of the\nelectron to be (1.6 × 10-19C)/(1.76 × 1011 C/kg) = 9.1× 10-31 kg. This mass is\nless than a thousandth the mass of the smallest atom, and thus confirmed the idea\nthat the electron is only a part of an atom. The accepted value today for the mass\nof the electron is\nme = 9.11 × 10-31 kg.\nThe experimental result that any charge is an integral multiple of e means that\nelectric charge is quantized (exists only in discrete amounts).\nAtomizer\n+++\nDroplets\n+:\n+\n+\n+\n+++\n–\n–\nTelescope\nFIGURE 27-3 Millikan\'s oil-drop\nexperiment.\nSECTION 27-1 773\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': '1.0 ×\n1015\nIntensity\n-\n1\n+ Frequency (Hz)\n3.0× 2.0×\n1014 1014\n1.0×\n1014\n6000 K\n4500 K\n1\n3000 K\n0 UVL\n1000 IR\n2000\n3000\nVisible\nWavelength (nm) -*\nFIGURE 27-4 Measured spectra of\nwavelengths and frequencies\nemitted by a blackbody at three\ndifferent temperatures.\n27-2 Blackbody Radiation;\nPlanck\'s Quantum Hypothesis\nBlackbody Radiation\nOne of the observations that was unexplained at the end of the nineteenth cen-\ntury was the spectrum of light emitted by hot objects. We saw in Section 14-8\nthat all objects emit radiation whose total intensity is proportional to the fourth\npower of the Kelvin (absolute) temperature (T4). At normal temperatures\n(~ 300 K), we are not aware of this electromagnetic radiation because of its low\nintensity. At higher temperatures, there is sufficient infrared radiation that we\ncan feel heat if we are close to the object. At still higher temperatures (on the\norder of 1000 K), objects actually glow, such as a red-hot electric stove burner or\nthe heating element in a toaster. At temperatures above 2000 K, objects glow with\na yellow or whitish color, such as white-hot iron and the filament of a lightbulb.\nThe light emitted contains a continuous range of wavelengths or frequencies, and\nthe spectrum is a plot of intensity vs. wavelength or frequency. As the temperature\nincreases, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects not only increases in\ntotal intensity but has its peak intensity at higher and higher frequencies.\nThe spectrum of light emitted by a hot dense object is shown in Fig. 27-4 for\nan idealized blackbody. A blackbody is a body that, when cool, would absorb all\nthe radiation falling on it (and so would appear black under reflection when\nilluminated by other sources). The radiation such an idealized blackbody would\nemit when hot and luminous, called blackbody radiation (though not necessarily\nblack in color), approximates that from many real objects. The 6000-K curve in\nFig. 27-4, corresponding to the temperature of the surface of the Sun, peaks in\nthe visible part of the spectrum. For lower temperatures, the total intensity drops\nconsiderably and the peak occurs at longer wavelengths (or lower frequencies).\nThis is why objects glow with a red color at around 1000 K. It is found experimen-\ntally that the wavelength at the peak of the spectrum, Ap, is related to the Kelvin\ntemperature T by\nApT = 2.90 X 10-3 m . K.\n(27-2)\nThis is known as Wien\'s law.\nEXAMPLE 27-1\nThe Sun\'s surface temperature.

In the visible region, the curve will be descending, so the shortest visible\nwavelengths will be strongest. Hence the star will appear bluish (or blue-white).\nNOTE This example helps us to understand why stars have different colors\n(reddish for the coolest stars; orangish, yellow, white, bluish for "hotter" stars.)\nEXERCISE A What is the color of an object at 4000 K?\n774 CHAPTER 27\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Planck\'s Quantum Hypothesis\nIn the year 1900, Max Planck (1858-1947) proposed a theory that was able to\nreproduce the graphs of Fig. 27-4. His theory, still accepted today, made a new and\nradical assumption: that the energy of the oscillations of atoms within molecules\ncannot have just any value; instead each has energy which is a multiple of a mini-\nmum value related to the frequency of oscillation by\nE = hf.\nHere h is a new constant, now called Planck\'s constant, whose value was\nestimated by Planck by fitting his formula for the blackbody radiation curve to\nexperiment. The value accepted today is\nh = 6.626 × 10-34 J . s.\nPlanck\'s assumption suggests that the energy of any molecular vibration could be\nonly a whole number multiple of hf:\nE = nhf,\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\n(27-3)\nwhere n is called a quantum number ("quantum" means "discrete amount" as\nopposed to "continuous"). This idea is often called Planck\'s quantum hypothesis,\nalthough little attention was brought to this point at the time. In fact, it appears\nthat Planck considered it more as a mathematical device to get the "right answer"\nrather than as an important discovery. Planck himself continued to seek a classical\nexplanation for the introduction of h. The recognition that this was an important\nand radical innovation did not come until later, after about 1905 when others,\nparticularly Einstein, entered the field.\nThe quantum hypothesis, Eq. 27-3, states that the energy of an oscillator\ncan be E = hf, or 2hf, or 3hf, and so on, but there cannot be vibrations with\nenergies between these values. That is, energy would not be a continuous quan-\ntity as had been believed for centuries; rather it is quantized-it exists only\nin discrete amounts. The smallest amount of energy possible (hf) is called the\nquantum of energy. Recall from Chapter 11 that the energy of an oscillation is\nproportional to the amplitude squared. Another way of expressing the quantum\nhypothesis is that not just any amplitude of vibration is possible. The possible\nvalues for the amplitude are related to the frequency f.\nA simple analogy may help. Compare a ramp, on which a box can be placed\nat any height, to a flight of stairs on which the box can have only certain discrete\namounts of potential energy, as shown in Fig. 27-5.\n27-3 Photon Theory of Light and\nthe Photoelectric Effect\nIn 1905, the same year that he introduced the special theory of relativity, Einstein\nmade a bold extension of the quantum idea by proposing a new theory of light.\nPlanck\'s work had suggested that the vibrational energy of molecules in a radiat-\ning object is quantized with energy E = nhf, where n is an integer and f is the\nfrequency of molecular vibration. Einstein argued that when light is emitted by a\nmolecular oscillator, the molecule\'s vibrational energy of nhf must decrease by an\namount hf (or by 2hf, etc.) to another integer times hf, such as (n - 1)hf. Then\nto conserve energy, the light ought to be emitted in packets, or quanta, each with\nan energy\nE = hf,\n(27-4)\nwhere f is here the frequency of the emitted light. Again h is Planck\'s constant.\nBecause all light ultimately comes from a radiating source, this idea suggests that\nlight is transmitted as tiny particles, or photons as they are now called, as well as via\nthe waves predicted by Maxwell\'s electromagnetic theory. The photon theory of\nlight was also a radical departure from classical ideas. Einstein proposed a test of the\nquantum theory of light: quantitative measurements on the photoelectric effect.\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 27-5 Ramp versus stair\nanalogy. (a) On a ramp, a box can have\ncontinuous values of potential energy.\n(b) But on stairs, the box can have\nonly discrete (quantized) values of\nenergy.\nPhoton energy\nSECTION 27-3 Photon Theory of Light and the Photoelectric Effect 775\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Light\nsource\nLight\nC\n–\n–\nP\nPhotocell\nA\nV\n+\n–\nFIGURE 27-6 The photoelectric\neffect.\nWave\ntheory\npredictions\nWhen light shines on a metal surface, electrons are found to be emitted from\nthe surface. This effect is called the photoelectric effect and it occurs in many\nmaterials, but is most easily observed with metals. It can be observed using the\napparatus shown in Fig. 27-6. A metal plate P and a smaller electrode C are\nplaced inside an evacuated glass tube, called a photocell. The two electrodes are\nconnected to an ammeter and a source of emf, as shown. When the photocell is in\nthe dark, the ammeter reads zero. But when light of sufficiently high frequency\nilluminates the plate, the ammeter indicates a current flowing in the circuit. We\nexplain completion of the circuit by imagining that electrons, ejected from the\nplate by the impinging light, flow across the tube from the plate to the "collector" C\nas indicated in Fig. 27-6.\nThat electrons should be emitted when light shines on a metal is consistent\nwith the electromagnetic (EM) wave theory of light: the electric field of an\nEM wave could exert a force on electrons in the metal and eject some of them.\nEinstein pointed out, however, that the wave theory and the photon theory of\nlight give very different predictions on the details of the photoelectric effect. For\nexample, one thing that can be measured with the apparatus of Fig. 27-6 is the\nmaximum kinetic energy (KEmax) of the emitted electrons. This can be done by\nusing a variable voltage source and reversing the terminals so that electrode C is\nnegative and P is positive. The electrons emitted from P will be repelled by the\nnegative electrode, but if this reverse voltage is small enough, the fastest electrons\nwill still reach C and there will be a current in the circuit. If the reversed voltage\nis increased, a point is reached where the current reaches zero-no electrons\nhave sufficient kinetic energy to reach C. This is called the stopping potential, or\nstopping voltage, Vo, and from its measurement, KEmax can be determined using\nconservation of energy (loss of kinetic energy = gain in potential energy):\nKEmax = eVo .\nNow let us examine the details of the photoelectric effect from the point of\nview of the wave theory versus Einstein\'s particle theory.\nFirst the wave theory, assuming monochromatic light. The two important\nproperties of a light wave are its intensity and its frequency (or wavelength). When\nthese two quantities are varied, the wave theory makes the following predictions:\n1. If the light intensity is increased, the number of electrons ejected and their\nmaximum kinetic energy should be increased because the higher intensity\nmeans a greater electric field amplitude, and the greater electric field should\neject electrons with higher speed.\n2. The frequency of the light should not affect the kinetic energy of the ejected\nelectrons. Only the intensity should affect KEmax ·\nThe photon theory makes completely different predictions. First we note that\nin a monochromatic beam, all photons have the same energy (= hf). Increasing\nthe intensity of the light beam means increasing the number of photons in the\nbeam, but does not affect the energy of each photon as long as the frequency is\nnot changed. According to Einstein\'s theory, an electron is ejected from the metal\nby a collision with a single photon. In the process, all the photon energy is trans-\nferred to the electron and the photon ceases to exist. Since electrons are held in\nthe metal by attractive forces, some minimum energy W0 is required just to get\nan electron out through the surface. W0 is called the work function, and is a few\nelectron volts (1 eV = 1.6 × 10-19 J) for most metals. If the frequency f of the\nincoming light is so low that hf is less than W0 , then the photons will not have\nenough energy to eject any electrons at all. If hf > Wo, then electrons will be\nejected and energy will be conserved in the process. That is, the input energy (of\nthe photon), hf, will equal the outgoing kinetic energy KE of the electron plus the\nenergy required to get it out of the metal, W:\nhf = KE + W.\n(27-5a)\nThe least tightly held electrons will be emitted with the most kinetic energy (KEmax),\n776 CHAPTER 27 Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'in which case W in this equation becomes the work function Wo, and KE\nbecomes KEmax :\nhf = KEmax + Wo -\n[least bound electrons] (27-5b)\nMany electrons will require more energy than the bare minimum (Wo) to get out\nof the metal, and thus the kinetic energy of such electrons will be less than the\nmaximum.\nFrom these considerations, the photon theory makes the following predictions:\n1. An increase in intensity of the light beam means more photons are incident,\nso more electrons will be ejected; but since the energy of each photon is not\nchanged, the maximum kinetic energy of electrons is not changed by an\nincrease in intensity.\n2. If the frequency of the light is increased, the maximum kinetic energy of the\nelectrons increases linearly, according to Eq. 27-5b. That is,\nKEmax = hf - Wo.\nThis relationship is plotted in Fig. 27-7.\n3. If the frequency f is less than the "cutoff" frequency fo, where hfo = Wo, no\nelectrons will be ejected, no matter how great the intensity of the light.\nThese predictions of the photon theory are very different from the predictions\nof the wave theory. In 1913-1914, careful experiments were carried out by R. A.\nMillikan. The results were fully in agreement with Einstein\'s photon theory.\nOne other aspect of the photoelectric effect also confirmed the photon\ntheory. If extremely low light intensity is used, the wave theory predicts a time\ndelay before electron emission so that an electron can absorb enough energy to\nexceed the work function. The photon theory predicts no such delay-it only\ntakes one photon (if its frequency is high enough) to eject an electron-and\nexperiments showed no delay. This too confirmed Einstein\'s photon theory.\nEXAMPLE 27-3\nPhoton energy.

Burglar alarms\nand automatic doors often make use of the photocell circuit of Fig. 27-6. When\na person interrupts the beam of light, the sudden drop in current in the circuit\nactivates a switch-often a solenoid-which operates a bell or opens the door.\nUV or IR light is sometimes used in burglar alarms because of its invisibility. Many\nsmoke detectors use the photoelectric effect to detect tiny amounts of smoke\nthat interrupt the flow of light and so alter the electric current. Photographic light\nmeters use this circuit as well. Photocells are used in many other devices, such as\nabsorption spectrophotometers, to measure light intensity. One type of film sound\ntrack is a variably shaded narrow section at the side of the film, Fig. 27-8. Light\npassing through the film is thus "modulated," and the output electrical signal\nof the photocell detector follows the frequencies on the sound track. For many\napplications today, the vacuum-tube photocell of Fig. 27-6 has been replaced by a\nsemiconductor device known as a photodiode (Section 29-9). In these semicon-\nductors, the absorption of a photon liberates a bound electron so it can move\nfreely, which changes the conductivity of the material and the current through a\nphotodiode is altered.\n778 CHAPTER 27 Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': "27-4 Energy, Mass, and\nMomentum of a Photon\nWe have just seen (Eq. 27-4) that the total energy of a single photon is given by\nE = hf. Because a photon always travels at the speed of light, it is truly a rela-\ntivistic particle. Thus we must use relativistic formulas for dealing with its mass,\nenergy, and momentum. The momentum of any particle of mass m is given by\np = mv/\\ 1 - v2/c2. Since v = c for a photon, the denominator is zero. To\navoid having an infinite momentum, we conclude that the photon's mass must be\nzero: m = 0. This makes sense too because a photon can never be at rest (it\nalways moves at the speed of light). A photon's kinetic energy is its total energy:\nKE = E = hf.\n[photon]\nThe momentum of a photon can be obtained from the relativistic formula\n(Eq. 26-9) E2 = p2c2 + m2c4 where we set m = 0, so E2 = p2c2 or\np = E.\n[photon]\nSince E = hf for a photon, its momentum is related to its wavelength by\np = 5 - ht -\n(27-6)\nCAUTION\nMomentum of photon is not mv\nEXAMPLE 27-6 |ESTIMATE\nPhoton momentum and force.

The reverse chemical reaction releases an energy of\n4.9 eV/molecule of CO2, so 4.9 eV is needed to transform CO2 to carbohydrate.\nAPPROACH The efficiency is the minimum energy required (4.9 eV) divided\nby the actual energy absorbed, nine times the energy (hf) of one photon.\nSOLUTION The energy of nine photons, each of energy hf = hc/A, is\n(9)(6.63× 10-34 J.s)(3.00×108m/s)/(6.7×10-7m)= 2.7×10-18 J or 17 eV.\nThus the process is about (4.9 eV/17 eV) = 29% efficient.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nPhotosynthesis\nSECTION 27-4 Energy, Mass, and Momentum of a Photon 779\n", 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': '*\n27-5 Compton Effect\nBEFORE\nAFTER\nCOLLISION\nCOLLISION\ny\nScattered\nphoton (2\')\nIncident\nphoton (2)\nφ\n17\nElectron\nat rest\ninitially\nθ\nFIGURE 27-9 The Compton effect.\nA single photon of wavelength À\nstrikes an electron in some material,\nknocking it out of its atom.

One of\nthese was the Compton effect (1923) named after its discoverer, A. H. Compton\n(1892-1962). Compton aimed short-wavelength light (actually X-rays) at various\nmaterials, and detected light scattered at various angles. He found that the scattered\nlight had a slightly longer wavelength than did the incident light, and therefore a\nslightly lower frequency indicating a loss of energy. He explained this result on the\nbasis of the photon theory as incident photons colliding with electrons of the\nmaterial, Fig. 27-9. Using Eq. 27-6 for momentum of a photon, Compton applied\nthe laws of conservation of momentum and energy to the collision of Fig. 27-9\nand derived the following equation for the wavelength of the scattered photons:\n=\nmec\nh\n(1 - cos ø),\n(27-7)\nwhere me is the mass of the electron. (The quantity h/mec, which has the dimen-\nsions of length, is called the Compton wavelength of the electron.) We see that\nthe predicted wavelength of scattered photons depends on the angle ø at which\nthey are detected. Compton\'s measurements of 1923 were consistent with this\nformula. The wave theory of light predicts no such shift: an incoming electro-\nmagnetic wave of frequency f should set electrons into oscillation at frequency f;\nand such oscillating electrons would reemit EM waves of this same frequency f\n(Section 22-2), which would not change with angle ($). Hence the Compton\neffect adds to the firm experimental foundation for the photon theory of light.\nEXERCISE D When a photon scatters off an electron by the Compton effect, which of\nthe following increases: its energy, frequency, wavelength?\nEXAMPLE 27-8\nX-ray scattering. X-rays of wavelength 0.140 nm are\nscattered from a very thin slice of carbon. What will be the wavelengths of X-rays\nscattered at (a) 0°, (b) 90°, (c) 180°?\nAPPROACH This is an example of the Compton effect, and we use Eq. 27-7 to\nfind the wavelengths.\nSOLUTION (a) For ø = 0°, cos ø = 1 and 1 - cos ø = 0. Then Eq. 27-7\ngives À\' = > = 0.140 nm. This makes sense since for $ = 0°, there really isn\'t\nany collision as the photon goes straight through without interacting.\n(b) For ø = 90°, cos ø = 0, and 1 - cos ø =1.

Gamma rays, which are photons of even shorter wavelength than X-rays, coming\nfrom a radioactive source are scattered off bone material. The total intensity of\nthe scattered radiation is proportional to the density of electrons, which is in turn\nproportional to the bone density. A low bone density may indicate osteoporosis.\n780 CHAPTER 27 Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': '27-6 Photon Interactions; Pair Production\nWhen a photon passes through matter, it interacts with the atoms and electrons.\nThere are four important types of interactions that a photon can undergo:\n1. The photoelectric effect: A photon may knock an electron out of an atom and\nin the process the photon disappears.\n2. The photon may knock an atomic electron to a higher energy state in the atom if\nits energy is not sufficient to knock the electron out altogether. In this process\nthe photon also disappears, and all its energy is given to the atom. Such an\natom is then said to be in an excited state, and we shall discuss it more later.\n3. The photon can be scattered from an electron (or a nucleus) and in the\nprocess lose some energy; this is the Compton effect (Fig. 27-9). But notice\nthat the photon is not slowed down. It still travels with speed c, but its\nfrequency will be lower because it has lost some energy.\n4. Pair production: A photon can actually create matter, such as the production\nof an electron and a positron, Fig. 27-10. (A positron has the same mass as\nan electron, but the opposite charge, +e.)\nIn process 4, pair production, the photon disappears in the process of creating\nthe electron-positron pair. This is an example of mass being created from pure\nenergy, and it occurs in accord with Einstein\'s equation E = mc2. Notice that a\nphoton cannot create an electron alone since electric charge would not then be\nconserved. The inverse of pair production also occurs: if a positron comes close to\nan electron, the two quickly annihilate each other and their energy, including\ntheir mass, appears as electromagnetic energy of photons. Because positrons are\nnot as plentiful in nature as electrons, they usually do not last long.\nElectron-positron annihilation is the basis for the type of medical imaging\nknown as PET, as discussed in Section 31-8.\net\nPhoton\n+\nNucleus\nFIGURE 27-10 Pair production:\na photon disappears and produces an\nelectron and a positron.\nEXAMPLE 27-9\nPair production. (a) What is the minimum energy of a\nphoton that can produce an electron-positron pair? (b) What is this photon\'s\nwavelength?\nAPPROACH The minimum photon energy E equals the rest energy (mc2) of\nthe two particles created, via Einstein\'s famous equation E = mc2 (Eq. 26-7).\nThere is no energy left over, so the particles produced will have zero kinetic\nenergy. The wavelength is A = c/f where E = hf for the original photon.\nSOLUTION (a) Because E = mc2, and the mass created is equal to two electron\nmasses, the photon must have energy\nE = 2(9.11 × 10-31 kg)(3.00×108m/s)2 = 1.64× 10-13 J = 1.02 MeV\n(1 MeV = 106 eV = 1.60 × 10-13 J). A photon with less energy cannot undergo\npair production.\n(b) Since E = hf = hc/), the wavelength of a 1.02-MeV photon is\nhc\n=\n(6.63 × 10-34 J · s)(3.00 × 108 m/s)\n=\n1.2 × 10-12 m,\n1 = "\nE\n(1.64 × 10-13 J)\nwhich is 0.0012 nm. Such photons are in the gamma-ray (or very short X-ray)\nregion of the electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 22-8).\nNOTE Photons of higher energy (shorter wavelength) can also create an electron-\npositron pair, with the excess energy becoming kinetic energy of the particles.\nPair production cannot occur in empty space, for momentum could not be con-\nserved. In Example 27-9, for instance, energy is conserved, but only enough energy\nwas provided to create the electron-positron pair at rest and thus with zero momen-\ntum, which could not equal the initial momentum of the photon. Indeed, it can be\nshown that at any energy, an additional massive object, such as an atomic nucleus\n(Fig. 27-10), must take part in the interaction to carry off some of the momentum.\nSECTION 27-6 Photon Interactions; Pair Production 781\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 27-11 Niels Bohr (right),\nwalking with Enrico Fermi along the\nAppian Way outside Rome.

Light can act like a wave or\nlike a particle\nde Broglie wavelength\n27-7 Wave-Particle Duality; the\nPrinciple of Complementarity\nThe photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, and other experiments have placed\nthe particle theory of light on a firm experimental basis. But what about the classic\nexperiments of Young and others (Chapter 24) on interference and diffraction\nwhich showed that the wave theory of light also rests on a firm experimental basis?\nWe seem to be in a dilemma. Some experiments indicate that light behaves like\na wave; others indicate that it behaves like a stream of particles. These two theories\nseem to be incompatible, but both have been shown to have validity. Physicists\nfinally came to the conclusion that this duality of light must be accepted as a\nfact of life. It is referred to as the wave-particle duality. Apparently, light is a\nmore complex phenomenon than just a simple wave or a simple beam of particles.\nTo clarify the situation, the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885-1962,\nFig. 27-11) proposed his famous principle of complementarity. It states that to\nunderstand an experiment, sometimes we find an explanation using wave theory\nand sometimes using particle theory. Yet we must be aware of both the wave and\nparticle aspects of light if we are to have a full understanding of light. Therefore\nthese two aspects of light complement one another.\nIt is not easy to "visualize" this duality. We cannot readily picture a combina-\ntion of wave and particle. Instead, we must recognize that the two aspects of light\nare different "faces" that light shows to experimenters.\nPart of the difficulty stems from how we think. Visual pictures (or models) in\nour minds are based on what we see in the everyday world. We apply the\nconcepts of waves and particles to light because in the macroscopic world we see\nthat energy is transferred from place to place by these two methods. We cannot\nsee directly whether light is a wave or particle, so we do indirect experiments. To\nexplain the experiments, we apply the models of waves or of particles to the\nnature of light. But these are abstractions of the human mind. When we try to\nconceive of what light really "is," we insist on a visual picture. Yet there is no\nreason why light should conform to these models (or visual images) taken from\nthe macroscopic world. The "true" nature of light-if that means anything-is\nnot possible to visualize. The best we can do is recognize that our knowledge is\nlimited to the indirect experiments, and that in terms of everyday language and\nimages, light reveals both wave and particle properties.\nIt is worth noting that Einstein\'s equation E = hf itself links the particle\nand wave properties of a light beam. In this equation, E refers to the energy of a\nparticle; and on the other side of the equation, we have the frequency f of the\ncorresponding wave.\n27-8 Wave Nature of Matter\nIn 1923, Louis de Broglie (1892-1987) extended the idea of the wave-particle\nduality. He appreciated the symmetry in nature, and argued that if light some-\ntimes behaves like a wave and sometimes like a particle, then perhaps those things\nin nature thought to be particles-such as electrons and other material objects-\nmight also have wave properties. De Broglie proposed that the wavelength of a\nmaterial particle would be related to its momentum in the same way as for a photon,\nEq. 27-6, p = h/>. That is, for a particle having linear momentum p = mv,\nthe wavelength À is given by\nh\n1 = h,\n(27-8)\np\nand is valid classically (p = mv for v << c) and relativistically (p = Ymv =\nmv/1 - 02/c2). This is sometimes called the de Broglie wavelength of a\nparticle.\n782 CHAPTER 27 Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 27-10\nWavelength of a ball.

Even if the speed is extremely small, say 10-4 m/s, the wavelength\nwould be about 10-29 m. Indeed, the wavelength of any ordinary object is much\ntoo small to be measured and detected. The problem is that the properties of\nwaves, such as interference and diffraction, are significant only when the size of\nobjects or slits is not much larger than the wavelength. And there are no known\nobjects or slits to diffract waves only 10-30 m long, so the wave properties of\nordinary objects go undetected.\nBut tiny elementary particles, such as electrons, are another matter. Since\nthe mass m appears in the denominator of Eq. 27-8, a very small mass should\nhave a much larger wavelength.\nEXAMPLE 27-11\nWavelength of an electron. Determine the wavelength\nof an electron that has been accelerated through a potential difference of 100 V.\nAPPROACH If the kinetic energy is much less than the rest energy, we can use\nthe classical formula, KE = 2mv2 (see end of Section 26-9). For an electron,\nmc2 = 0.511 MeV. We then apply conservation of energy: the kinetic energy\nacquired by the electron equals its loss in potential energy. After solving for v,\nwe use Eq. 27-8 to find the de Broglie wavelength.\nSOLUTION The gain in kinetic energy equals the loss in potential energy:\nAPE = eV - 0. Thus KE = eV, So KE = 100 eV.

Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nElectron Diffraction\nFrom Example 27-11, we see that electrons can have wavelengths on the order\nof 10-10 m, and even smaller. Although small, this wavelength can be detected:\nthe spacing of atoms in a crystal is on the order of 10-10 m and the orderly array\nof atoms in a crystal could be used as a type of diffraction grating, as was done\nearlier for X-rays (see Section 25-11). C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer per-\nformed the crucial experiment: they scattered electrons from the surface of a metal\ncrystal and, in early 1927, observed that the electrons were scattered into a pattern\nof regular peaks. When they interpreted these peaks as a diffraction pattern, the\nwavelength of the diffracted electron wave was found to be just that predicted by\nde Broglie, Eq. 27-8. In the same year, G. P. Thomson (son of J. J. Thomson) used\na different experimental arrangement and also detected diffraction of electrons.\n(See Fig. 27-12. Compare it to X-ray diffraction, Section 25-11.) Later experiments\nshowed that protons, neutrons, and other particles also have wave properties.\nFIGURE 27-12 Diffraction pattern\nof electrons scattered from\naluminum foil, as recorded on film.\nSECTION 27-8 Wave Nature of Matter\n783\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'PHYSICS APPLIED\nElectron diffraction\nbeam\nelectron\nIncident\nd sin 0\n-\n-\nu\nu\nd\n.\nFIGURE 27-13 Example 27-12.\nThe red dots represent atoms in an\norderly array in a solid.\nThus the wave-particle duality applies to material objects as well as to light.\nThe principle of complementarity applies to matter as well.

The wave nature of electrons is mani-\nfested in experiments where an electron beam interacts with the atoms on the\nsurface of a solid, especially crystals. By studying the angular distribution of the\ndiffracted electrons, one can indirectly measure the geometrical arrangement of\natoms. Assume that the electrons strike perpendicular to the surface of a solid\n(see Fig. 27-13), and that their energy is low, KE = 100 eV, so that they interact\nonly with the surface layer of atoms. If the smallest angle at which a diffraction\nmaximum occurs is at 24°, what is the separation d between the atoms on the\nsurface?\nSOLUTION Treating the electrons as waves, we need to determine the condi-\ntion where the difference in path traveled by the wave diffracted from adjacent\natoms is an integer multiple of the de Broglie wavelength, so that constructive\ninterference occurs. The path length difference is d sin 0 (Fig. 27-13); so for the\nsmallest value of 0 we must have\nd sin 0 = À.\nHowever, À is related to the (non-relativistic) kinetic energy KE by\n2me x2\np2\n=\nh2\n.\nKE =\n2me\nh\nThus\n1\nV\n2me KE\n(6.63 × 10-34 J ·s)\n=\n= 0.123 nm.\n12(9.11 × 10-31 kg)(100 eV)(1.6 × 10-19 J/eV)\nThe surface inter-atomic spacing is\nd\n=\nl\n0.123 nm\n=\n0.30 nm.\nsin 0\nsin 24°\nNOTE Experiments of this type verify both the wave nature of electrons and\nthe orderly array of atoms in crystalline solids.\nWhat Is an Electron?\nWe might ask ourselves: "What is an electron?" The early experiments of\nJ. J. Thomson (Section 27-1) indicated a glow in a tube, and that glow moved when\na magnetic field was applied. The results of these and other experiments were best\ninterpreted as being caused by tiny negatively charged particles which we now call\nelectrons. No one, however, has actually seen an electron directly. The drawings we\nsometimes make of electrons as tiny spheres with a negative charge on them are\nmerely convenient pictures (now recognized to be inaccurate). Again we must rely\non experimental results, some of which are best interpreted using the particle\nmodel and others using the wave model. These models are mere pictures that we\nuse to extrapolate from the macroscopic world to the tiny microscopic world of\nthe atom. And there is no reason to expect that these models somehow reflect the\nreality of an electron. We thus use a wave or a particle model (whichever works\nbest in a situation) so that we can talk about what is happening. But we should not\nbe led to believe that an electron is a wave or a particle. Instead we could say that\nan electron is the set of its properties that we can measure. Bertrand Russell said\nit well when he wrote that an electron is "a logical construction."\n784 CHAPTER 27 Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': '27-9 Electron Microscopes\nThe idea that electrons have wave properties led to the development of the\nelectron microscope (EM), which can produce images of much greater magnifi-\ncation than a light microscope.

The tip is moved as for the STM.\n27-10 Early Models of the Atom\nThe idea that matter is made up of atoms was accepted by most scientists by 1900.\nWith the discovery of the electron in the 1890s, scientists began to think of the atom\nitself as having a structure with electrons as part of that structure. We now discuss\nhow our modern view of the atom developed, and the quantum theory with which\nit is intertwined.+\nA typical model of the atom in the 1890s visualized the atom as a homogene-\nous sphere of positive charge inside of which there were tiny negatively charged\nelectrons, a little like plums in a pudding, Fig. 27-18.\nAround 1911, Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) and his colleagues performed\nexperiments whose results contradicted the plum-pudding model of the atom. In\nthese experiments a beam of positively charged alpha (a) particles was directed\nat a thin sheet of metal foil such as gold, Fig. 27-19. (These newly discovered\na particles were emitted by certain radioactive materials and were soon shown\nto be doubly ionized helium atoms-that is, having a charge of +2e.) It was\nViewing screen\nFIGURE 27-19 Experimental setup\nfor Rutherford\'s experiment:\na particles emitted by radon are\ndeflected by the atoms of a thin metal\nfoil and a few rebound backward.\na particles\nSource\ncontaining\nradon\nMetal\nfoil\nexpected from the plum-pudding model that the alpha particles would not be\ndeflected significantly because electrons are so much lighter than alpha particles,\nand the alpha particles should not have encountered any massive concentration\nof positive charge to strongly repel them. The experimental results completely\ncontradicted these predictions. It was found that most of the alpha particles\npassed through the foil unaffected, as if the foil were mostly empty space.\n*Some readers may say: "Tell us the facts as we know them today, and don\'t bother us with the histor-\nical background and its outmoded theories." Such an approach would ignore the creative aspect of\nscience and thus give a false impression of how science develops. Moreover, it is not really possible to\nunderstand today\'s view of the atom without insight into the concepts that led to it.\n786 CHAPTER 27 Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'And of those deflected, a few were deflected at very large angles-some even\nbackward, nearly in the direction from which they had come. This could happen,\nRutherford reasoned, only if the positively charged alpha particles were being\nrepelled by a massive positive charge concentrated in a very small region of space\n(see Fig. 27-20). He hypothesized that the atom must consist of a tiny but mas-\nsive positively charged nucleus, containing over 99.9% of the mass of the atom,\nsurrounded by much lighter electrons some distance away. The electrons would\nbe moving in orbits about the nucleus-much as the planets move around the\nSun-because if they were at rest, they would fall into the nucleus due to electri-\ncal attraction. See Fig. 27-21. Rutherford\'s experiments suggested that the nucleus\nmust have a radius of about 10-15 to 10-14 m. From kinetic theory, and especially\nEinstein\'s analysis of Brownian motion (see Section 13-1), the radius of atoms\nwas estimated to be about 10-10 m. Thus the electrons would seem to be at a\ndistance from the nucleus of about 10,000 to 100,000 times the radius of the\nnucleus itself. (If the nucleus were the size of a baseball, the atom would have the\ndiameter of a big city several kilometers across.) So an atom would be mostly\nempty space.\nRutherford\'s planetary model of the atom (also called the nuclear model\nof the atom) was a major step toward how we view the atom today. It was not,\nhowever, a complete model and presented some major problems, as we shall see.\n27-11 Atomic Spectra: Key to the\nStructure of the Atom\nEarlier in this Chapter we saw that heated solids (as well as liquids and dense gases)\nemit light with a continuous spectrum of wavelengths. This radiation is assumed to\nbe due to oscillations of atoms and molecules, which are largely governed by the\ninteraction of each atom or molecule with its neighbors.\nRarefied gases can also be excited to emit light. This is done by intense\nheating, or more commonly by applying a high voltage to a "discharge tube"\ncontaining the gas at low pressure, Fig. 27-22. The radiation from excited gases\nhad been observed early in the nineteenth century, and it was found that the\nspectrum was not continuous. Rather, excited gases emit light of only certain\nwavelengths, and when this light is analyzed through the slit of a spectroscope\nor spectrometer, a line spectrum is seen rather than a continuous spectrum.\nThe line spectra emitted by a number of elements in the visible region are shown\nbelow in Fig. 27-23, and in Chapter 24, Fig. 24-28. The emission spectrum is\ncharacteristic of the material and can serve as a type of "fingerprint" for\nidentification of the gas.\nWe also saw (Chapter 24) that if a continuous spectrum passes through a\nrarefied gas, dark lines are observed in the emerging spectrum, at wavelengths\ncorresponding to lines normally emitted by the gas. This is called an absorption\nspectrum (Fig. 27-23c), and it became clear that gases can absorb light at the\nsame frequencies at which they emit. Using film sensitive to ultraviolet and to\ninfrared light, it was found that gases emit and absorb discrete frequencies in\nthese regions as well as in the visible.\n(a)\nNucleus\n+\n+\na particle\nFIGURE 27-20 Backward rebound\nof a particles in Fig. 27-19 explained\nas the repulsion from a heavy\npositively charged nucleus.\nFIGURE 27-21 Rutherford\'s model\nof the atom: electrons orbit a tiny\npositive nucleus (not to scale).

Thus the line\nspectra serve as a key to the structure of the atom: any theory of atomic structure\nmust be able to explain why atoms emit light only of discrete wavelengths, and it\nshould be able to predict what these wavelengths are.\nHydrogen is the simplest atom-it has only one electron orbiting its nucleus.\nIt also has the simplest spectrum. The spectrum of most atoms shows little\napparent regularity. But the spacing between lines in the hydrogen spectrum\ndecreases in a regular way, Fig. 27-24. Indeed, in 1885, J. J. Balmer (1825-1898)\nshowed that the four lines in the visible portion of the hydrogen spectrum (with\nmeasured wavelengths 656 nm, 486 nm, 434 nm, and 410 nm) have wavelengths\nthat fit the formula\n1\n,\nn = 3, 4, . . . .\n(27-9)\nl\n= R\n22\n1_1\nn2\n656\nRed\nFIGURE 27-24 Balmer series of\nlines for hydrogen.\nHere n takes on the values 3, 4, 5, 6 for the four visible lines, and R, called the\nRydberg constant, has the value R = 1.0974 × 107 m-1. Later it was found that\nthis Balmer series of lines extended into the UV region, ending at À = 365 nm,\nas shown in Fig. 27-24. Balmer's formula, Eq. 27-9, also worked for these lines\nwith higher integer values of n. The lines near 365 nm become too close together\nto distinguish, but the limit of the series at 365 nm corresponds to n = oo (so\n1/n2 = 0 in Eq. 27-9).\nLater experiments on hydrogen showed that there were similar series of lines\nin the UV and IR regions, and each series had a pattern just like the Balmer\nseries, but at different wavelengths, Fig. 27-25. Each of these series was found to\nFIGURE 27-25 Line spectrum of\natomic hydrogen. Each series fits the\nformula\n1 = R( 1 - 1)\nwhere\nn' = 1 for the Lyman series,\nn' = 2 for the Balmer series,\nn' = 3 for the Paschen series,\nand so on; n can take on all integer\nvalues from n = n' + 1 up to infinity.\nThe only lines in the visible region\nof the electromagnetic spectrum are\npart of the Balmer series.\nWavelength, A\n91 nm\n122 nm\n365 nm\n656 nm\n820 nm\nLyman\nseries\nBalmer series\nUV\nVisible light\n1875 nm\nPaschen series\nIR\nfit a formula with the same form as Eq. 27-9 but with the 1/22 replaced by\n1/12, 1/32, 1/42, and so on.

It\nhad other difficulties as well. According to the Rutherford model, electrons orbit\nthe nucleus, and since their paths are curved the electrons are accelerating. Hence\nthey should give off light like any other accelerating electric charge (Chapter 22).\n788 CHAPTER 27 Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom\n", 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Since light carries off energy and energy is conserved, the electron\'s own energy\nmust decrease to compensate. Hence electrons would be expected to spiral into the\nnucleus. As they spiraled inward, their frequency would increase in a short time\nand so too would the frequency of the light emitted. Thus the two main difficulties\nof the Rutherford model are these: (1) it predicts that light of a continuous range of\nfrequencies will be emitted, whereas experiment shows line spectra; (2) it predicts\nthat atoms are unstable-electrons would quickly spiral into the nucleus-but we\nknow that atoms in general are stable, because there is stable matter all around us.\nClearly Rutherford\'s model was not sufficient. Some sort of modification\nwas needed, and Niels Bohr provided it in a model that included the quantum\nhypothesis. Although the Bohr model has been superseded, it did provide a\ncrucial stepping stone to our present understanding. And some aspects of the\nBohr model are still useful today, so we examine it in detail in the next Section.\n27-12 The Bohr Model\nBohr had studied in Rutherford\'s laboratory for several months in 1912 and was\nconvinced that Rutherford\'s planetary model of the atom had validity. But in\norder to make it work, he felt that the newly developing quantum theory would\nsomehow have to be incorporated in it. The work of Planck and Einstein had\nshown that in heated solids, the energy of oscillating electric charges must change\ndiscontinuously-from one discrete energy state to another, with the emission of\na quantum of light. Perhaps, Bohr argued, the electrons in an atom also cannot\nlose energy continuously, but must do so in quantum "jumps." In working out his\nmodel during the next year, Bohr postulated that electrons move about the nucleus\nin circular orbits, but that only certain orbits are allowed. He further postulated\nthat an electron in each orbit would have a definite energy and would move in the\norbit without radiating energy (even though this violated classical ideas since\naccelerating electric charges are supposed to emit EM waves; see Chapter 22).\nHe thus called the possible orbits stationary states. In this Bohr model, light is\nemitted only when an electron jumps from a higher (upper) stationary state to\nanother of lower energy, Fig. 27-26. When such a transition occurs, a single pho-\nton of light is emitted whose energy, by energy conservation, is given by\nhf = Eu - Eę,\n(27-10)\nwhere Eu refers to the energy of the upper state and Ee the energy of the lower\nstate.\nIn 1912-13, Bohr set out to determine what energies these orbits would have\nin the simplest atom, hydrogen; the spectrum of light emitted could then be pre-\ndicted from Eq. 27-10. In the Balmer formula he had the key he was looking for.\nBohr quickly found that his theory would agree with the Balmer formula if\nhe assumed that the electron\'s angular momentum L is quantized and equal to an\ninteger n times h/2T. As we saw in Chapter 8 angular momentum is given by\nL = Io, where I is the moment of inertia and @ is the angular velocity. For a\nsingle particle of mass m moving in a circle of radius r with speed v, I = mr2 and\n@ = v/r; hence, L = Iw = (mr2)(v/r) = mvr. Bohr\'s quantum condition is\n= no\nL = mvrn = n\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\n(27-11)\nwhere n is an integer and rn is the radius of the nth possible orbit. The allowed\norbits are numbered 1, 2, 3, ... , according to the value of n, which is called the\nprincipal quantum number of the orbit.\nEquation 27-11 did not have a firm theoretical foundation. Bohr had searched\nfor some "quantum condition," and such tries as E = hf (where E represents\nthe energy of the electron in an orbit) did not give results in accord with experi-\nment. Bohr\'s reason for using Eq. 27-11 was simply that it worked; and we now\nlook at how. In particular, let us determine what the Bohr theory predicts for the\nmeasurable wavelengths of emitted light.\nEu\nhf\nEp\nFIGURE 27-26 An atom emits a\nphoton (energy = hf) when its\nenergy changes from Eu to a lower\nenergy El.\nSECTION 27-12 The Bohr Model 789\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': '-e\nF =\n(Ze)(e)\nr2\n+Ze\nAn electron in a circular orbit of radius r (Fig. 27-27) would have a centripetal\nacceleration v2/r produced by the electrical force of attraction between the\nnegative electron and the positive nucleus.

Similarly, doubly ionized lithium, Li2+, also has a single electron, and in this case Z = 3.\n*Be careful not to believe that these well-defined orbits actually exist. Today electrons are better\nthought of as forming "clouds," as discussed in Chapter 28.\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'In each of its possible orbits, the electron in a Bohr model atom would have a\ndefinite energy, as the following calculation shows.

The quantum number n that labels the orbit radii also labels the energy\nlevels. The lowest energy level or energy state has energy E1, and is called the\nground state. The higher states, E2, E3, and so on, are called excited states. The\nfixed energy levels are also called stationary states.\nNotice that although the energy for the larger orbits has a smaller numerical\nvalue, all the energies are less than zero. Thus, -3.4 eV is a higher energy than\n-13.6 eV. Hence the orbit closest to the nucleus (r1) has the lowest energy (the\nmost negative). The reason the energies have negative values has to do with the way\nwe defined the zero for potential energy. For two point charges, PE = kq1 92/r\ncorresponds to zero potential energy when the two charges are infinitely far apart\n(Section 17-5). Thus, an electron that can just barely be free from the atom by\nreaching r = oo (or, at least, far from the nucleus) with zero kinetic energy will\nhave E = KE + PE = 0 + 0 = 0, corresponding to n = co in Eqs. 27-15. If an\nelectron is free and has kinetic energy, then E > 0. To remove an electron that is\npart of an atom requires an energy input (otherwise atoms would not be stable).\nSince E ≥ 0 for a free electron, then an electron bound to an atom needs to have\nE < 0. That is, energy must be added to bring its energy up, from a negative\nvalue to at least zero in order to free it.\nThe minimum energy required to remove an electron from an atom initially\nin the ground state is called the binding energy or ionization energy. The ionization\nenergy for hydrogen has been measured to be 13.6 eV, and this corresponds\nprecisely to removing an electron from the lowest state, E1 = - 13.6 eV, up to\nE = 0 where it can be free.\nSECTION 27-12 The Bohr Model 791\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 22, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Spectra Lines Explained\nIt is useful to show the various possible energy values as horizontal lines on an\nenergy-level diagram.

At room temperature, nearly all\nH atoms will be in the ground state (n = 1). At higher temperatures, or during\nan electric discharge when there are many collisions between free electrons and\natoms, many atoms can be in excited states (n > 1).

We can predict wavelengths of the spectral lines emitted\naccording to Bohr theory by combining Eq. 27-10 with Eq. 27-15. Since\nhf = hc/>, we have from Eq. 27-10\nhc\n== hf = 1\nhc\n(En - En\'),\nwhere n refers to the upper state and n\' to the lower state.

To\nconserve energy, only photons that have just the right energy will be absorbed. This\nexplains why a continuous spectrum of light entering a gas will emerge with dark\n(absorption) lines at frequencies that correspond to emission lines (Fig. 27-23c).\nThe Bohr theory also ensures the stability of atoms.

The next smaller wavelength occurs for the jump from the ground\nstate to the second excited state.\nSOLUTION The energy needed to jump from the ground state to the first excited\nstate is 13.6 eV - 3.4 eV = 10.2 eV; the required wavelength, as we saw in\nExample 27-13, is 122 nm. The energy to jump from the ground state to the second\nexcited state is 13.6 eV - 1.5 eV = 12.1 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength\n1 = =\nf\nc\nhc\n=\nhf\nhc\n=\n(6.63×10-34 J·s)(3.00×108 m/s)\nE3 - E1\n(12.1 eV)(1.60 × 10-19 J/eV)\n= 103 nm.\nSECTION 27-12 793\n", 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 24, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 27-16\nHe+ ionization energy. (a) Use the Bohr model to deter-\nmine the ionization energy of the He+ ion, which has a single electron. (b) Also\ncalculate the maximum wavelength a photon can have to cause ionization. The\nhelium atom is the second atom, after hydrogen, in the Periodic Table (next\nChapter); its nucleus contains 2 protons and normally has 2 electrons circulating\naround it, so Z = 2.\nAPPROACH We want to determine the minimum energy required to lift the\nelectron from its ground state and to barely reach the free state at E = 0. The\nground state energy of He+ is given by Eq. 27-15b with n = 1 and Z = 2.\nSOLUTION (a) Since all the symbols in Eq. 27-15b are the same as for the\ncalculation for hydrogen, except that Z is 2 instead of 1, we see that E1 will be\nZ2 = 22 = 4 times the E1 for hydrogen:\nE1 = 4(-13.6 eV) = - 54.4 eV.\nThus, to ionize the He+ ion should require 54.4 eV, and this value agrees with\nexperiment.\n(b) The maximum wavelength photon that can cause ionization will have energy\nhf = 54.4 eV and wavelength\n1 = € = hc\nhf\n(6.63 × 10-34 J ·s)(3.00 × 108 m/s)\n= 22.8 nm.\n(54.4 eV)(1.60 × 10-19 J/eV)\nIf > > 22.8 nm, ionization can not occur.\nNOTE If the atom absorbed a photon of greater energy (wavelength shorter\nthan 22.8 nm), the atom could still be ionized and the freed electron would have\nkinetic energy of its own.\nIn this Example 27-16, we saw that E1 for the He+ ion is four times more\nnegative than that for hydrogen. Indeed, the energy-level diagram for He+ looks\njust like that for hydrogen, Fig. 27-29, except that the numerical values for each\nenergy level are four times larger. Note, however, that we are talking here about\nthe He+ ion. Normal (neutral) helium has two electrons and its energy level\ndiagram is entirely different.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 27-17\nHydrogen at 20°C. (a) Estimate the\naverage kinetic energy of whole hydrogen atoms (not just the electrons) at room\ntemperature. (b) Use the result to explain why, at room temperature, very few\nH atoms are in excited states and nearly all are in the ground state, and hence\nemit no light.\nRESPONSE According to kinetic theory (Chapter 13), the average kinetic\nenergy of atoms or molecules in a gas is given by Eq. 13-8:\nKE = 2kT,\nwhere k = 1.38 × 10-23 J/K is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the kelvin\n(absolute) temperature. Room temperature is about T = 300 K, so\nKE = 2(1.38 × 10-23 J/K)(300K) = 6.2 × 10-21 J,\nor, in electron volts:\n6.2 × 10-21 J\nKE =\n1.6 × 10-19 J/eV\n= 0.04 eV.\nThe average KE of an atom as a whole is thus very small compared to the energy\nbetween the ground state and the next higher energy state (13.6 eV - 3.4 eV =\n10.2 eV). Any atoms in excited states quickly fall to the ground state and emit\nlight. Once in the ground state, collisions with other atoms can transfer energy\nof only 0.04 eV on the average. A small fraction of atoms can have much more\nenergy (see Section 13-10 on the distribution of molecular speeds), but even a\nkinetic energy that is 10 times the average is not nearly enough to excite atoms\ninto states above the ground state. Thus, at room temperature, practically all\natoms are in the ground state. Atoms can be excited to upper states by very high\ntemperatures, or by applying a high voltage so a current of high energy electrons\npasses through the gas as in a discharge tube (Fig. 27-22).\n794 CHAPTER 27\n", 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 25, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Correspondence Principle\nWe should note that Bohr made some radical assumptions that were at variance\nwith classical ideas. He assumed that electrons in fixed orbits do not radiate light\neven though they are accelerating (moving in a circle), and he assumed that\nangular momentum is quantized. Furthermore, he was not able to say how an\nelectron moved when it made a transition from one energy level to another. On\nthe other hand, there is no real reason to expect that in the tiny world of the atom\nelectrons would behave as ordinary-sized objects do. Nonetheless, he felt that\nwhere quantum theory overlaps with the macroscopic world, it should predict\nclassical results. This is the correspondence principle, already mentioned in\nregard to relativity (Section 26-11). This principle does work for Bohr\'s theory\nof the hydrogen atom. The orbit sizes and energies are quite different for n = 1\nand n = 2, say. But orbits with n = 100,000,000 and 100,000,001 would be very\nclose in radius and energy (see Fig. 27-29). Indeed, transitions between such\nlarge orbits, which would approach macroscopic sizes, would be imperceptible.\nSuch orbits would thus appear to be continuously spaced, which is what we\nexpect in the everyday world.\nFinally, it must be emphasized that the well-defined orbits of the Bohr model\ndo not actually exist. The Bohr model is only a model, not reality. The idea of\nelectron orbits was rejected a few years later, and today electrons are thought of\n(Chapter 28) as forming "probability clouds."\n27-13 de Broglie\'s Hypothesis\nApplied to Atoms\n(a)\nBohr\'s theory was largely of an ad hoc nature. Assumptions were made so that\ntheory would agree with experiment. But Bohr could give no reason why the orbits\nwere quantized, nor why there should be a stable ground state. Finally, ten years\nlater, a reason was proposed by Louis de Broglie. We saw in Section 27-8 that\nin 1923, de Broglie proposed that material particles, such as electrons, have a wave\nnature; and that this hypothesis was confirmed by experiment several years later.\nOne of de Broglie\'s original arguments in favor of the wave nature of elec-\ntrons was that it provided an explanation for Bohr\'s theory of the hydrogen\natom. According to de Broglie, a particle of mass m moving with a nonrelativistic\nspeed v would have a wavelength (Eq. 27-8) of\n1 = 1.\nmv\nEach electron orbit in an atom, he proposed, is actually a standing wave. As we\nsaw in Chapter 11, when a violin or guitar string is plucked, a vast number of\nwavelengths are excited. But only certain ones-those that have nodes at the\nends-are sustained. These are the resonant modes of the string. Waves with\nother wavelengths interfere with themselves upon reflection and their amplitudes\nquickly drop to zero. With electrons moving in circles, according to Bohr\'s theory,\nde Broglie argued that the electron wave was a circular standing wave that closes\non itself, Fig. 27-30a. If the wavelength of a wave does not close on itself, as in\nFig. 27-30b, destructive interference takes place as the wave travels around the\nloop, and the wave quickly dies out. Thus, the only waves that persist are those for\nwhich the circumference of the circular orbit contains a whole number of wave-\nlengths, Fig. 27-31. The circumference of a Bohr orbit of radius ry is 2Trn, so to\nhave constructive interference, we need\n(b)\nFIGURE 27-30 (a) An ordinary\nstanding wave compared to a\ncircular standing wave.

Standing\ncircular waves for two, three, and\nfive wavelengths on the circumference;\nn, the number of wavelengths,\nis also the quantum number.\nNow we have a first explanation for the quantized orbits and energy states in the\nBohr model: they are due to the wave nature of the electron, and only resonant\n"standing" waves can persist .* This implies that the wave-particle duality is at\nthe root of atomic structure.\nIn viewing the circular electron waves of Fig. 27-31, the electron is not to be\nthought of as following the oscillating wave pattern. In the Bohr model of hydrogen,\nthe electron moves in a circle. The circular wave, on the other hand, represents the\namplitude of the electron "matter wave," and in Fig. 27-31 the wave amplitude\nis shown superimposed on the circular path of the particle orbit for convenience.\nBohr\'s theory worked well for hydrogen and for one-electron ions. But it did\nnot prove successful for multi-electron atoms. Bohr theory could not predict line\nspectra even for the next simplest atom, helium. It could not explain why some emis-\nsion lines are brighter than others, nor why some lines are split into two or more\nclosely spaced lines ("fine structure"). A new theory was needed and was indeed\ndeveloped in the 1920s. This new and radical theory is called quantum mechanics.\nIt finally solved the problem of atomic structure, but it gives us a very different\nview of the atom: the idea of electrons in well-defined orbits was replaced with the\nidea of electron "clouds." This new theory of quantum mechanics has given us a\nwholly different view of the basic mechanisms underlying physical processes.\n+We note, however, that Eq. 27-11 is no longer considered valid, as discussed in the next Chapter.\nSummary\nThe electron was discovered using an evacuated cathode ray\ntube. The measurement of the charge-to-mass ratio (e/m) of\nthe electron was done using magnetic and electric fields. The\ncharge e on the electron was first measured in the Millikan\noil-drop experiment and then its mass was obtained from the\nmeasured value of the e/m ratio.\nQuantum theory has its origins in Planck\'s quantum hypothesis\nthat molecular oscillations are quantized: their energy E can only\nbe integer (n) multiples of hf, where h is Planck\'s constant and\nf is the natural frequency of oscillation:\nE = nhf.\n(27-3)\nThis hypothesis explained the spectrum of radiation emitted by\na blackbody at high temperature.\nEinstein proposed that for some experiments, light could\nbe pictured as being emitted and absorbed as quanta (particles),\nwhich we now call photons, each with energy\nand momentum\nE = hf\n(27-4)\np = C = t = 2.\n(27-6)\nHe proposed the photoelectric effect as a test for the photon\ntheory of light. In the photoelectric effect, the photon theory\nsays that each incident photon can strike an electron in a\nmaterial and eject it if the photon has sufficient energy. The\nmaximum energy of ejected electrons is then linearly related to\nthe frequency of the incident light.\nThe photon theory is also supported by the Compton\neffect and the observation of electron-positron pair production.\nThe wave-particle duality refers to the idea that light and\nmatter (such as electrons) have both wave and particle proper-\nties. The wavelength of an object is given by\n1 = 1,\n(27-8)\nwhere p is the momentum of the object (p = mv for a particle\nof mass m and speed v).\nThe principle of complementarity states that we must be\naware of both the particle and wave properties of light and of\nmatter for a complete understanding of them.\nElectron microscopes (EM) make use of the wave proper-\nties of electrons to form an image: their "lenses" are magnetic.\nVarious types of EM exist: some can magnify 100,000× (1000X\nbetter than a light microscope); others can give a 3-D image.\nEarly models of the atom include Rutherford\'s planetary\n(or nuclear) model of an atom which consists of a tiny but\nmassive positively charged nucleus surrounded (at a relatively\ngreat distance) by electrons.\nTo explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the\nstability of atoms, the Bohr model postulated that: (1) elec-\ntrons bound in an atom can only occupy orbits for which the\nangular momentum is quantized, which results in discrete\nvalues for the radius and energy; (2) an electron in such a\nstationary state emits no radiation; (3) if an electron jumps to\na lower state, it emits a photon whose energy equals the\ndifference in energy between the two states; (4) the angular\nmomentum L of atomic electrons is quantized by the rule\nL = nh/2Tr, where n is an integer called the quantum number.\nThe n = 1 state is the ground state, which in hydrogen has\nan energy E1 = - 13.6 eV. Higher values of n correspond to\nexcited states, and their energies are\nEn = - (13.6 eV)\nZ\n(27-15b)\nwhere Ze is the charge on the nucleus. Atoms are excited to\nthese higher states by collisions with other atoms or electrons,\nor by absorption of a photon of just the right frequency.\nDe Broglie\'s hypothesis that electrons (and other matter)\nhave a wavelength À = h/mv gave an explanation for Bohr\'s\nquantized orbits by bringing in the wave-particle duality: the\norbits correspond to circular standing waves in which the cir-\ncumference of the orbit equals a whole number of wavelengths.\n796 CHAPTER 27 Early Quantum Theory and Models of the Atom\n', 'chapter_title': '27-1 Discovery and Properties of the Electron'}, {'page_number': 27, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Questions\n1.
