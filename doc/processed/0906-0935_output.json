The transformation of one element into another, called\ntransmutation, also occurs via nuclear reactions. A nuclear reaction is said to occur\nwhen a nucleus is struck by another nucleus, or by a simpler particle such as a Y ray,\nneutron, or proton, and an interaction takes place. Ernest Rutherford was the first\nto report seeing a nuclear reaction. In 1919 he observed that some of the a particles\npassing through nitrogen gas were absorbed and protons emitted. He concluded\nthat nitrogen nuclei had been transformed into oxygen nuclei via the reaction\n4He + 14N > 130 + H,\nwhere 4He is an a particle, and 1H is a proton.\n885\n", 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Since then, a great many nuclear reactions have been observed. Indeed, many\nof the radioactive isotopes used in the laboratory are made by means of nuclear\nreactions. Nuclear reactions can be made to occur in the laboratory, but they also\noccur regularly in nature. In Chapter 30 we saw an example: 14C is continually\nbeing made in the atmosphere via the reaction n + 14N -> 14C + p.\nNuclear reactions are sometimes written in a shortened form: for example,\nn + 14N -> 14C + p\ncan be written\n14N (n, p) 14C.\nThe symbols outside the parentheses on the left and right represent the initial\nand final nuclei, respectively. The symbols inside the parentheses represent the\nbombarding particle (first) and the emitted small particle (second).\nIn any nuclear reaction, both electric charge and nucleon number are con-\nserved. These conservation laws are often useful, as the following Example shows.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 31-1\nDeuterium reaction. A neutron is\nobserved to strike an 100 nucleus, and a deuteron is given off. (A deuteron, or\ndeuterium, is the isotope of hydrogen containing one proton and one neutron, 2H;\nit is sometimes given the symbol d or D.) What is the nucleus that results?\nRESPONSE We have the reaction n + 160 -> ? + 2H. The total number of\nnucleons initially is 1 + 16 = 17, and the total charge is 0 + 8 = 8. The same\ntotals apply after the reaction. Hence the product nucleus must have Z = 7\nand A = 15. From the Periodic Table, we find that it is nitrogen that has\nZ = 7, so the nucleus produced is 15N.\n| EXERCISE A Determine the resulting nucleus in the reaction n + 13/Ba -> ? + Y.\nEnergy and momentum are also conserved in nuclear reactions, and can be\nused to determine whether or not a given reaction can occur. For example, if the\ntotal mass of the final products is less than the total mass of the initial particles,\nthis decrease in mass (recall AE = Am c2) is converted to kinetic energy (KE) of\nthe outgoing particles. But if the total mass of the products is greater than the\ntotal mass of the initial reactants, the reaction requires energy. The reaction will\nthen not occur unless the bombarding particle has sufficient kinetic energy.\nConsider a nuclear reaction of the general form\na + X -> Y + b,\n(31-1)\nwhere particle a is a moving projectile particle (or small nucleus) that strikes\nnucleus X, producing nucleus Y and particle b (typically, p, n, a, Y). We define\nthe reaction energy, or Q-value, in terms of the masses involved, as\nQ = (Ma + Mx - Mb - My)c2.\n(31-2a)\nFor a Y ray, M = 0. If energy is released by the reaction, Q > 0. If energy is\nrequired, Q < 0.\nBecause energy is conserved, Q has to be equal to the change in kinetic\nenergy (final minus initial):\nQ = KEb + KEY - KEa - KEx .\n(31-2b)\nIf X is a target nucleus at rest (or nearly so) struck by incoming particle a, then\nKEx = 0. For Q > 0, the reaction is said to be exothermic or exoergic; energy is\nreleased in the reaction, so the total kinetic energy is greater after the reaction\nthan before. If Q is negative, the reaction is said to be endothermic or endoergic:\nan energy input is required to make the reaction happen. The energy input comes\nfrom the kinetic energy of the initial colliding particles (a and X).\nEXAMPLE 31-2\nA slow-neutron reaction. The nuclear reaction\nn + 19B -> Li + 4He\nis observed to occur even when very slow-moving neutrons (mass Mn = 1.0087 u)\nstrike boron atoms at rest. For a particular reaction in which KEn ~ 0, the out-\ngoing helium (MHe = 4.0026 u) is observed to have a speed of 9.30 × 106 m/s.\nDetermine (a) the kinetic energy of the lithium (MLi = 7.0160 u), and (b) the\nQ-value of the reaction.\n886 CHAPTER 31\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'APPROACH Since the neutron and boron are both essentially at rest, the total\nmomentum before the reaction is zero; momentum is conserved and so must be\nzero afterward as well. Thus,\nMLAULi = MHe UHe .\nWe solve this for vLi and substitute it into the equation for kinetic energy. In (b)\nwe use Eq. 31-2b.\nSOLUTION (a) We can use classical kinetic energy with little error, rather than\nrelativistic formulas, because VHe = 9.30 × 106 m/s is not close to the speed of\nlight c. And vLi will be even less because MLi > MHe . Thus we can write the KE\nof the lithium, using the momentum equation just above, as\nKELi = & Muns = MLI MHe \'He\nMLi\n2\nMHle UHe .\n2MLi\n=\nWe put in numbers, changing the mass in u to kg and recall that\n1.60 × 10-13 J = 1 MeV:\nKELi\n=\n(4.0026 u)2(1.66 × 10-27 kg/u)2(9.30 × 106 m/s)2\n2(7.0160 u)(1.66 × 10-27 kg/u)\n= 1.64 × 10-13 J = 1.02 MeV.\n(b) We are given the data KEa = KEx = 0 in Eq. 31-2b, so Q = KELi + KEHe ,\nwhere\nKEHe = 2 MHe VHe = $(4.0026 u)(1.66 × 10-27 kg/u)(9.30 × 106 m/s)2\n= 2.87 × 10-13 J = 1.80 MeV.\nHence, Q = 1.02 MeV + 1.80 MeV = 2.82 MeV.\nEXAMPLE 31-3\nWill the reaction "go"? Can the reaction\np + 1℃ > 13N + n\noccur when 13C is bombarded by 2.0-MeV protons?\nAPPROACH The reaction will "go" if the reaction is exothermic (Q > 0) and\neven if Q < 0 if the input momentum and kinetic energy are sufficient. First\nwe calculate Q from the difference between final and initial masses using\nEq. 31-2a, and look up the masses in Appendix B.\nSOLUTION The total masses before and after the reaction are:\nBefore\nAfter\nM(12C) = 13.003355\nM(12N) = 13.005739\nM(1H) =\n1.007825\nM(n) = 1.008665\n.\n14.011180\n14.014404\n(We must use the mass of the 1H atom rather than that of the bare proton because\nthe masses of 13C and 13N include the electrons, and we must include an equal\nnumber of electron masses on each side of the equation.) The products have an\nexcess mass of\n(14.014404 - 14.011180)u = 0.003224 u X 931.5 MeV/u = 3.00 MeV.\nThus Q = - 3.00 MeV, and the reaction is endothermic. This reaction requires\nenergy, and the 2.0-MeV protons do not have enough to make it go.\nNOTE The incoming proton in this Example would need more than 3.00 MeV\nof kinetic energy to make this reaction go; 3.00 MeV would be enough to\nconserve energy, but a proton of this energy would produce the 12N and n with\nno kinetic energy and hence no momentum. Since an incident 3.0-MeV proton\nhas momentum, conservation of momentum would be violated. A calculation\nusing conservation of energy and of momentum, as we did in Examples 30-7\nand 31-2, shows that the minimum proton energy, called the threshold energy,\nis 3.23 Me V in this case.\nSECTION 31-1 Nuclear Reactions and the Transmutation of Elements 887\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': '(a)\nn+\n92\n239 U\nNeutron captured by 238 U.\n(b)\n232 U\n93 Np +e +\nv\n92 U decays by ß decay\nto neptunium-239.\n(c)\n93 Np\n(23 Pu+++\n93 Np itself decays by\nß decay to produce\nplutonium-239.\nFIGURE 31-1 Neptunium and\nplutonium are produced in this\nseries of reactions, after\nbombardment of 292U by neutrons.\nFIGURE 31-2 Projectile particles\nstrike a target of area A and\nthickness & made up of n nuclei per\nunit volume.\nProjectiles\nA\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nl\nNeutron Physics\nThe artificial transmutation of elements took a great leap forward in the 1930s\nwhen Enrico Fermi realized that neutrons would be the most effective projectiles\nfor causing nuclear reactions and in particular for producing new elements.\nBecause neutrons have no net electric charge, they are not repelled by positively\ncharged nuclei as are protons or alpha particles. Hence the probability of a\nneutron reaching the nucleus and causing a reaction is much greater than for\ncharged projectiles,+ particularly at low energies. Between 1934 and 1936, Fermi\nand his co-workers in Rome produced many previously unknown isotopes by\nbombarding different elements with neutrons. Fermi realized that if the heaviest\nknown element, uranium, is bombarded with neutrons, it might be possible to\nproduce new elements with atomic numbers greater than that of uranium. After\nseveral years of hard work, it was suspected that two new elements had been\nproduced, neptunium (Z = 93) and plutonium (Z = 94). The full confirmation\nthat such "transuranic" elements could be produced came several years later at\nthe University of California, Berkeley. The reactions are shown in Fig. 31-1.\nIt was soon shown that what Fermi had actually observed when he bom-\nbarded uranium was an even stranger process-one that was destined to play an\nextraordinary role in the world at large. We discuss it in Section 31-2.\n*\nCross Section\nSome reactions have a higher probability of occurring than others. The reaction\nprobability is specified by a quantity called the collision cross section. Although\nthe size of a nucleus, like that of an atom, is not a clearly defined quantity since\nthe edges are not distinct like those of a tennis ball or baseball, we can nonethe-\nless define a cross section for nuclei undergoing collisions by using an analogy.\nSuppose that projectile particles strike a stationary target of total area A and\nthickness {, as shown in Fig. 31-2. Assume also that the target is made up of\nidentical objects (such as marbles or nuclei), each of which has a cross-sectional\narea o, and we assume the incoming projectiles are small by comparison. We\nassume that the target objects are fairly far apart and the thickness & is so small\nthat we don\'t have to worry about overlapping. This is often a reasonable\nassumption because nuclei have diameters on the order of 10-14 m but are at least\n10-10 m (atomic size) apart even in solids. If there are n nuclei per unit volume,\nthe total cross-sectional area of all these tiny targets is\nA\' = nAlo\nsince nAl = (n)(volume) is the total number of targets and o is the cross-\nsectional area of each. If A\' << A, most of the incident projectile particles will\npass through the target without colliding. If R0 is the rate at which the projectile\nparticles strike the target (number/second), the rate at which collisions occur, R,\nis\nA\'\nnAlo\n= Ro"\nA\nR = R0\nA\nSO\nR = Ronlo.\nThus, by measuring the collision rate, R, we can determine o:\ns\nR0 nl\n=\nR\n.\nThe cross section o is an "effective" target area. It is a measure of the probability\nof a collision or of a particular reaction occurring per target nucleus, independent\nof the dimensions of the entire target. The concept of cross section is useful\n*That is, positively charged particles. Electrons rarely cause nuclear reactions because they do not\ninteract via the strong nuclear force.\n888 CHAPTER 31 Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': "because o depends only on the properties of the interacting particles, whereas R\ndepends on the thickness and area of the physical (macroscopic) target, on the\nnumber of particles in the incident beam, and so on.\n31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors\nIn 1938, the German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann made an amazing\ndiscovery. Following up on Fermi's work, they found that uranium bombarded\nby neutrons sometimes produced smaller nuclei that were roughly half the size\nof the original uranium nucleus. Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch quickly realized\nwhat had happened: the uranium nucleus, after absorbing a neutron, actually had\nsplit into two roughly equal pieces. This was startling, for until then the known\nnuclear reactions involved knocking out only a tiny fragment (for example,\nn, p, or a) from a nucleus.\nNuclear Fission and Chain Reactions\nThis new phenomenon was named nuclear fission because of its resemblance to\nbiological fission (cell division). It occurs much more readily for 232U than for the\nmore common 292U. The process can be visualized by imagining the uranium\nnucleus to be like a liquid drop. According to this liquid-drop model, the neutron\nabsorbed by the 232U nucleus (Fig. 31-3a) gives the nucleus extra internal energy\n(like heating a drop of water). This intermediate state, or compound nucleus, is 236U\n(because of the absorbed neutron), Fig. 31-3b. The extra energy of this nucleus-\nit is in an excited state-appears as increased motion of the individual nucleons\ninside, which causes the nucleus to take on abnormal elongated shapes. When the\nnucleus elongates (in this model) into the shape shown in Fig. 31-3c, the attraction\nof the two ends via the short-range nuclear force is greatly weakened by the\nincreased separation distance. Then the electric repulsive force becomes dominant,\nand the nucleus splits in two (Fig. 31-3d). The two resulting nuclei, X1 and X2,\nare called fission fragments, and in the process a number of neutrons (typically\ntwo or three) are also given off. The reaction can be written\nn + 232U -> 230U -> X1 + X2 + neutrons.\n(31-3)\nThe compound nucleus, 232U, exists for less than 10-12 s, so the process occurs\nvery quickly. The two fission fragments, X1 and X2, rarely split the original\nuranium mass precisely half and half, but more often as about 40%-60%. A typical\nfission reaction is\nn + 235U -> 14/Ba + 36K\n92Kr + 3n,\n(31-4)\nalthough many others also occur.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 31-4\nCounting nucleons. Identify the element X\nin the fission reaction n + 235\nAX + 33Sr + 2n.\nRESPONSE The number of nucleons is conserved (Section 30-7). The uranium\nnucleus with 235 nucleons plus the incoming neutron make 235 + 1 = 236\nnucleons. So there must be 236 nucleons after the reaction. The Sr has 93 nucleons,\nand the two neutrons make 95 nucleons, so X has A = 236 - 95 = 141.\nElectric charge is also conserved: before the reaction, the total charge is 92e.\nAfter the reaction the total charge is (Z + 38)e and must equal 92e. Thus\nZ = 92 - 38 = 54. The element with Z = 54 is xenon (see Appendix B or\nthe Periodic Table inside the back cover), so the isotope is 154Xe.\nn\n+\n235 U\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n(a)\n+ + +\n+\n+\n+ + +\n+\n+ + +\n+ +\n+\n(b) 236 U (compound nucleus)\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n(c)\n+\nn\nX2\nX1\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nn\n(d)\nn\nFIGURE 31-3 Fission of a 235U\nnucleus after capture of a neutron,\naccording to the liquid-drop model.\nFIGURE 31-4 Mass distribution of\nfission fragments from 235\n92U + n.\nThe small arrow indicates equal mass\nfragments (2 × (236 - 2) = 117,\nassuming 2 neutrons are liberated).\nNote that the vertical scale is\nlogarithmic.\n10\n1\nFission yield (percent)\n0.1\nEXERCISE B In the fission reaction n + 235U -> 1371\n1331 + 30Y + neutrons, how many\nneutrons are produced?\n0.01\nFigure 31-4 shows the measured distribution of 235U fission fragments accord-\ning to mass.

This can be seen from the binding-energy-per-nucleon\ncurve of Fig. 30-1; the binding energy per nucleon for uranium is about\n7.6 MeV/nucleon, but for fission fragments that have intermediate mass (in the\ncenter portion of the graph, A ~ 100), the average binding energy per nucleon is\nabout 8.5 MeV/nucleon. Since the fission fragments are more tightly bound, the\nsum of their masses is less than the mass of the uranium. The difference in mass,\nor energy, between the original uranium nucleus and the fission fragments is about\n8.5 - 7.6 = 0.9 MeV per nucleon. Because there are 236 nucleons involved in\neach fission, the total energy released per fission is\n(0.9 MeV/nucleon) (236 nucleons) ~ 200 MeV.\n(31-5)\nThis is an enormous amount of energy for one single nuclear event. At a practical\nlevel, the energy from one fission is tiny. But if many such fissions could occur\nin a short time, an enormous amount of energy at the macroscopic level would\nbe available. A number of physicists, including Fermi, recognized that the\nneutrons released in each fission (Eqs. 31-3 and 31-4) could be used to create a\nchain reaction. That is, one neutron initially causes one fission of a uranium\nnucleus; the two or three neutrons released can go on to cause additional fissions,\nso the process multiplies as shown schematically in Fig. 31-5.\nIf a self-sustaining chain reaction was actually possible in practice, the\nenormous energy available in fission could be released on a larger scale. Fermi\nand his co-workers (at the University of Chicago) showed it was possible by\nconstructing the first nuclear reactor in 1942 (Fig. 31-6).\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nNeutron\nn\nn\nn\nnuclei\nFission fragment\n235 U nucleus\nn\n0\nn\nn\n0\n0\nFIGURE 31-5 Chain reaction.\nFIGURE 31-6 This is the only photograph of the first\nnuclear reactor, built by Fermi under the grandstand of\nStagg Field at the University of Chicago. It is shown here\nunder construction as a layer of graphite (used as\nmoderator) was being placed over a layer of natural\nuranium. On December 2, 1942, Fermi slowly withdrew\nthe cadmium control rods and the reactor went critical.\nThis first self-sustaining chain reaction was announced to\nWashington, via telephone, by Arthur Compton who\nwitnessed the event and reported: "The Italian navigator\nhas just landed in the new world."\n890 CHAPTER 31 Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Nuclear Reactors\nSeveral problems have to be overcome to make any nuclear reactor function.\nFirst, the probability that a 232U nucleus will absorb a neutron is large only for\nslow neutrons, but the neutrons emitted during a fission (which are needed to\nsustain a chain reaction) are moving very fast. A substance known as a moderator\nmust be used to slow down the neutrons. The most effective moderator will\nconsist of atoms whose mass is as close as possible to that of the neutrons. (To see\nwhy this is true, recall from Chapter 7 that a billiard ball striking an equal mass\nball at rest can itself be stopped in one collision; but a billiard ball striking a\nheavy object bounces off with nearly unchanged speed.) The best moderator\nwould thus contain 1H atoms. Unfortunately, 1H tends to absorb neutrons. But\nthe isotope of hydrogen called deuterium, 2H, does not absorb many neutrons\nand is thus an almost ideal moderator. Either 1H or 2H can be used in the form of\nwater. In the latter case, it is heavy water, in which the hydrogen atoms have\nbeen replaced by deuterium. Another common moderator is graphite, which\nconsists of 12C atoms.\nA second problem is that the neutrons produced in one fission may be\nabsorbed and produce other nuclear reactions with other nuclei in the reactor,\nrather than produce further fissions. In a "light-water" reactor, the 1H nuclei\nabsorb neutrons, as does 238U to form 232U in the reaction n + 238U -> 232\n239U + Y.\nNaturally occurring uranium* contains 99.3% 232U and only 0.7% fissionable 232U.\nTo increase the probability of fission of 232U nuclei, natural uranium can be\nenriched to increase the percentage of 232U by using processes such as diffusion\nor centrifugation. Enrichment is not usually necessary for reactors using heavy\nwater as moderator because heavy water doesn\'t absorb neutrons .*\nThe third problem is that some neutrons will escape through the surface of\nthe reactor core before they can cause further fissions (Fig. 31-7). Thus the mass\nof fuel must be sufficiently large for a self-sustaining chain reaction to take place.\nThe minimum mass of uranium needed is called the critical mass. The value of\nthe critical mass depends on the moderator, the fuel (234Pu may be used instead\nof 235U), and how much the fuel is enriched, if at all. Typical values are on the\norder of a few kilograms (that is, neither grams nor thousands of kilograms).\nCritical mass depends also on the average number of neutrons released per\nfission: 2.5 for 232U, 2.9 for 234Pu so the critical mass for 234Pu is smaller.\nTo have a self-sustaining chain reaction, on average at least one neutron\nproduced in each fission must go on to produce another fission. The average\nnumber of neutrons per fission that do go on to produce further fissions is\ncalled the neutron multiplication factor, f. For a self-sustaining chain reaction,\nwe must have f = 1. If f < 1, the reactor is "subcritical." If f > 1, it is\n"supercritical" (and could become dangerously explosive). Reactors are equipped\nwith movable control rods (good neutron absorbers like cadmium or boron), whose\nfunction is to absorb neutrons and maintain the reactor at just barely "critical,"\nf =1.\nThe release of neutrons and subsequent fissions occur so quickly that\nmanipulation of the control rods to maintain f = 1 would not be possible if it\nweren\'t for the small percentage (~ 1%) of so-called delayed neutrons.\nThey come from the decay of neutron-rich fission fragments (or their daughters)\nhaving lifetimes on the order of seconds-sufficient to allow enough reaction\ntime to operate the control rods and maintain f = 1.\nNuclear reactors have been built for use in research and to produce electric\npower. Fission produces many neutrons and a "research reactor" is basically an\nintense source of neutrons. These neutrons can be used as projectiles in nuclear\nreactions to produce nuclides not found in nature, including isotopes used as\ntracers and for therapy. A "power reactor" is used to produce electric power.\n†\n82U will fission, but only with fast neutrons (232U is more stable than 235U). The probability of\nabsorbing a fast neutron and producing a fission is too low to produce a self-sustaining chain reaction.\n#Other types of power or research reactors need 3% to 20% of 235U. Atom bonds need greater enrich-\nment: ≥ 80%.\nn\n(a)\nn\nn\n(b)\nn\nFIGURE 31-7 If the amount of\nuranium exceeds the critical mass, as\nin (a), a sustained chain reaction is\npossible.

The core of a nuclear reactor consists of the fuel and a moderator\n(water in most U.S. commercial reactors). The fuel is usually uranium enriched\nso that it contains 2 to 4 percent 235U. Water at high pressure or other liquid (such\nas liquid sodium) is allowed to flow through the core. The thermal energy it\nabsorbs is used to produce steam in the heat exchanger, so the fissionable fuel\nacts as the heat input for a heat engine (Chapter 15).\nThere are problems associated with nuclear power plants. Besides the usual\nthermal pollution associated with any heat engine (Section 15-11), there is the\nserious problem of disposal of the radioactive fission fragments produced in\nthe reactor, plus radioactive nuclides produced by neutrons interacting with the\nstructural parts of the reactor. Fission fragments, like their uranium or plutonium\nparents, have about 50% more neutrons than protons. Nuclei with atomic\nnumber in the typical range for fission fragments (Z ~ 30 to 60) are stable only\nif they have more nearly equal numbers of protons and neutrons (see Fig. 30-2).\nHence the highly neutron-rich fission fragments are very unstable and decay\nradioactively. The accidental release of highly radioactive fission fragments into\nthe atmosphere poses a serious threat to human health (Section 31-4), as does\npossible leakage of the radioactive wastes when they are disposed of. The\naccidents at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania (1979), at Chernobyl, Russia (1986),\nand at Fukushima, Japan (2011), have illustrated some of the dangers and have\nshown that nuclear plants must be located, constructed, maintained, and oper-\nated with great care and precision (Fig. 31-9).\nFinally, the lifetime of nuclear power plants is limited to 30-some years, due\nto buildup of radioactivity and the fact that the structural materials themselves\nare weakened by the intense conditions inside. The cost of "decommissioning" a\npower plant is very great.\nSo-called breeder reactors were proposed as a solution to the problem of limited\nsupplies of fissionable uranium, 232U. A breeder reactor is one in which some of the\nneutrons produced in the fission of 235U are absorbed by 232U, and 234Pu is produced\nvia the set of reactions shown in Fig. 31-1. 234Pu is fissionable with slow neutrons,\nso after separation it can be used as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Thus a breeder\nreactor "breeds" new fuel+ (230Pu) from otherwise useless 232U. Natural uranium\nis 99.3 percent 232U, which in a breeder becomes useful fissionable 232Pu, thus\nincreasing the supply of fissionable fuel by more than a factor of 100. But breeder\nreactors have the same problems as other reactors, plus other serious problems.\nNot only is plutonium a serious health hazard in itself (radioactive with a half-life\nof 24,000 years), but plutonium produced in a reactor can readily be used in a bomb,\nincreasing the danger of nuclear proliferation and theft of fuel to produce a bomb.\n*A breeder reactor does not produce more fuel than it uses.\n892 CHAPTER 31\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Nuclear power presents risks. Other large-scale energy-conversion methods,\nsuch as conventional oil and coal-burning steam plants, also present health and\nenvironmental hazards; some of them were discussed in Section 15-11, and include\nair pollution, oil spills, and the release of CO2 gas which can trap heat as in a\ngreenhouse to raise the Earth\'s temperature. The solution to the world\'s needs for\nenergy is not only technological, but also economic and political. A major factor\nsurely is to "conserve"-to minimize our energy use.

Estimate the minimum amount of\n92U that needs to undergo fission in order to run a 1000-MW power reactor per\nyear of continuous operation. Assume an efficiency (Chapter 15) of about 33%.\nAPPROACH At 33% efficiency, we need 3× 1000 MW = 3000×106 J/s input.\nEach fission releases about 200 MeV (Eq. 31-5), so we divide the energy for\na year by 200 MeV to get the number of fissions needed per year. Then we\nmultiply by the mass of one uranium atom.\nSOLUTION For 1000 MW output, the total power generation needs to be\n3000 MW, of which 2000 MW is dumped as "waste" heat. Thus the total energy\nrelease in 1 yr (3 × 107 s) from fission needs to be about\n(3×109 J/s)(3×107s) ~ 1017 J.\nIf each fission releases 200 MeV of energy, the number of fissions required for a\nyear is\n(1017 J)\n~ 3 X 1027 fissions.\n(2 × 108 eV/fission)(1.6 × 10-19 J/eV)\nThe mass of a single uranium atom is about (235 u)(1.66 × 10-27 kg/u) ~\n4 × 10-25 kg, so the total uranium mass needed is\n(4 × 10-25 kg/fission)(3 × 1027 fissions) ~ 1000 kg,\nor about a ton of 235U.\nNOTE Because 232U makes up only 0.7% of natural uranium, the yearly require-\nment for uranium is on the order of a hundred tons. This is orders of magnitude\nless than coal, both in mass and volume. Coal releases 2.8 × 107 J/kg, whereas\n92U can release 1017 J per ton, as we just calculated, or 1017 J/103 kg = 1014 J/kg.\nFor natural uranium, the figure is 100 times less, 1012 J/kg.\nEXERCISE C A nuclear-powered submarine needs 6000-kW input power. How many\n232U fissions is this per second?\nAtom Bomb\nThe first use of fission, however, was not to produce electric power. Instead, it\nwas first used as a fission bomb (called the "atomic bomb"). In early 1940, with\nEurope already at war, Germany\'s leader, Adolf Hitler, banned the sale of\nuranium from the Czech mines he had recently taken over. Research into the\nfission process suddenly was enshrouded in secrecy. Physicists in the United\nStates were alarmed. A group of them approached Einstein-a man whose name\nwas a household word-to send a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt about\nthe possibilities of using nuclear fission for a bomb far more powerful than any\npreviously known, and inform him that Germany might already have begun\ndevelopment of such a bomb. Roosevelt responded by authorizing the program\nknown as the Manhattan Project, to see if a bomb could be built. Work began in\nearnest after Fermi\'s demonstration in 1942 that a sustained chain reaction was\npossible. A new secret laboratory was developed on an isolated mesa in New\nMexico known as Los Alamos. Under the direction of J. Robert Oppenheimer\n(1904-1967; Fig. 31-10), it became the home of famous scientists from all over\nEurope and the United States.\nFIGURE 31-10 J. Robert\nOppenheimer, on the left, with\nGeneral Leslie Groves, who was the\nadministrative head of Los Alamos\nduring World War II.

The shacks were\nconstructed afterwards from debris\nin the ruins. The bombs dropped on\nHiroshima and Nagasaki were each\nequivalent to about 20,000 tons of\nthe common explosive TNT (~ 1014 J).\nTo build a bomb that was subcritical during transport but that could be made\nsupercritical (to produce a chain reaction) at just the right moment, two pieces of\nuranium were used, each less than the critical mass but together greater than the\ncritical mass. The two masses, kept separate until the moment of detonation,\nwere then forced together quickly by a kind of gun, and a chain reaction of\nexplosive proportions occurred. An alternate bomb detonated conventional\nexplosives (TNT) surrounding a plutonium sphere to compress it by implosion to\ndouble its density, making it more than critical and causing a nuclear explosion.\nThe first fission bomb was tested in the New Mexico desert in July 1945. It was\nsuccessful. In early August, a fission bomb using uranium was dropped on\nHiroshima and a second, using plutonium, was dropped on Nagasaki (Fig. 31-11),\nboth in Japan. World War II ended shortly thereafter.\nBesides its destructive power, a fission bomb produces many highly radio-\nactive fission fragments, as does a nuclear reactor. When a fission bomb explodes,\nthese radioactive isotopes are released into the atmosphere as radioactive fallout.\nTesting of nuclear bombs in the atmosphere after World War II was a cause\nof concern, because the movement of air masses spread the fallout all over the globe.\nRadioactive fallout eventually settles to the Earth, particularly in rainfall, and is\nabsorbed by plants and grasses and enters the food chain. This is a far more serious\nproblem than the same radioactivity on the exterior of our bodies, because « and\nB particles are largely absorbed by clothing and the outer (dead) layer of skin. But\ninside our bodies as food, the isotopes are in contact with living cells. One particu-\nlarly dangerous radioactive isotope is 39Sr, which is chemically much like calcium\nand becomes concentrated in bone, where it causes bone cancer and destroys bone\nmarrow. The 1963 treaty signed by over 100 nations that bans nuclear weapons\ntesting in the atmosphere was motivated because of the hazards of fallout.\n31-3 Nuclear Fusion\nThe mass of every stable nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its consti-\ntuent protons and neutrons. For example, the mass of the helium isotope 4He\nis less than the mass of two protons plus two neutrons, Example 30-3. If two\nprotons and two neutrons were to come together to form a helium nucleus, there\nwould be a loss of mass. This mass loss is manifested in the release of energy.\nNuclear Fusion; Stars\nThe process of building up nuclei by bringing together individual protons and\nneutrons, or building larger nuclei by combining small nuclei, is called nuclear fusion.\nIn Fig. 31-12 (same as Fig. 30-1), we can see why small nuclei can combine to form\nlarger ones with the release of energy: it is because the binding energy per\nnucleon is less for light nuclei than it is for heavier nuclei (up to about A ~ 60).\nFIGURE 31-12 Average binding\nenergy per nucleon as a function of\nmass number A for stable nuclei.\nSame as Fig. 30-1.\n10\n16\n56\n26 Fe\n120 g\n50 Sn\n8\nHe\n238\n92 U\n6\n4\n2\n0\n2He\n2H\nBinding energy per nucleon (MeV)\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n894 CHAPTER 31\nNumber of nucleons, A (mass number)\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'For two positively charged nuclei to get close enough to fuse, they must have very\nhigh kinetic energy to overcome the electric repulsion. It is believed that many of\nthe elements in the universe were originally formed through the process of fusion\nin stars (see Chapter 33) where the temperature is extremely high, corresponding\nto high KE (Eq. 13-8). Today fusion is still producing the prodigious amounts of\nlight energy (EM waves) stars emit, including our Sun.\nEXAMPLE 31-6\nFusion energy release. One of the simplest fusion reac-\ntions involves the production of deuterium, 2H, from a neutron and a proton:\n1H + n -> {H + Y. How much energy is released in this reaction?\nAPPROACH The energy released equals the difference in mass (times c2)\nbetween the initial and final masses.\nSOLUTION From Appendix B, the initial mass is\n1.007825 u + 1.008665 u = 2.016490 u,\nand after the reaction the mass is that of the 2H, namely 2.014102 u (the Y is\nmassless). The mass difference is\n2.016490 u - 2.014102 u = 0.002388 u,\nso the energy released is\n(Am)c2 = (0.002388 u)(931.5 MeV/u) = 2.22 MeV,\nand it is carried off by the 2H nucleus and the Y ray.\nThe energy output of our Sun is believed to be due principally to the following\nsequence of fusion reactions:\n1H + H -> 1H + e+ + v\n(0.42 MeV)\n(31-6a)\nProton-\n1H + 2H -> 3He + Y\n(5.49 MeV)\n(31-6b)\nproton\n2He + 3He -> 4He + 1H + H.\n(12.86 MeV)\n(31-6c)\nchain\nwhere the energy released (Q-value) for each reaction is given in parentheses.\n(They include keeping track of atomic electrons as for B-decay, Section 30-5.)\nThese reactions are between nuclei (without electrons at these very high tempera-\ntures); the first reaction can be written as\np+p>d+e++v\nwhere p = proton and d = deuteron. The net effect of this sequence, which is\ncalled the proton-proton chain, is for four protons to combine to form one 4He\nnucleus plus two positrons, two neutrinos, and two gamma rays:\n41H -> 4He + 2e+ + 2v + 2Y.\n(31-7)\nNote that it takes two of each of the first two reactions (Eqs. 31-6a and b) to produce\nthe two 2He for the third reaction. Also, each of the two e+ (Eq. 31-6a) quickly\nannihilates with an electron to produce 2 Y rays (Section 27-6) with total energy\n2mec2 = 1.02 MeV. So the total energy release for the net reaction, Eq. 31-7, is\n2(0.42 MeV) + 2(1.02 MeV) + 2(5.49 MeV) + 12.86 MeV = 26.7 MeV.\nThe first reaction, the formation of deuterium from two protons (Eq. 31-6a), has a\nvery low probability, and so limits the rate at which the Sun produces energy.\n(Thank goodness; this is why the Sun and other stars have long lifetimes and\nare still shining brightly.)\nEXERCISE D Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 885, and answer it again\nnow.

Estimate the\nenergy released if the following reaction occurred:\nRH + 1H -> 4He.\nAPPROACH We use Fig. 31-12 for a quick estimate.\nSOLUTION We see in Fig. 31-12 that each 2H has a binding energy of about\n14 MeV/nucleon, which for 2 nuclei of mass 2 is 4 × (14) ~ 5 MeV. The 4He has\na binding energy per nucleon (Fig. 31-12) of about 7 MeV for a total of 4 × 7 Me V ~\n28 MeV. Hence the energy release is about 28 MeV - 5 MeV ~ 23 MeV.\nSECTION 31-3 895\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Carbon\ncycle\nIn stars hotter than the Sun, it is more likely that the energy output comes\nprincipally from the carbon (or CNO) cycle, which comprises the following\nsequence of reactions:\n12C + 1H -> 12N + Y\n12N -> 13C + e+ + v\nC + 1H -> 14N + Y\n14N + 1H -> 150 + Y\n150 -> 15N + e+ + v\n15N + 1H -> 12C + 4He.\nNo net carbon is consumed in this cycle and the net effect is the same as the\nproton-proton chain, Eq. 31-7 (plus one extra Y). The theory of the proton-\nproton chain and of the carbon cycle as the source of energy for the Sun and stars\nwas first worked out by Hans Bethe (1906-2005) in 1939.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 31-8\nStellar fusion. What is the heaviest\nelement likely to be produced in fusion processes in stars?\nRESPONSE Fusion is possible if the final products have more binding energy\n(less mass) than the reactants, because then there is a net release of energy.\nSince the binding energy curve in Fig. 31-12 (or Fig. 30-1) peaks near A ~ 56\nto 58 which corresponds to iron or nickel, it would not be energetically\nfavorable to produce elements heavier than that. Nevertheless, in the center of\nmassive stars or in supernova explosions, there is enough initial kinetic energy\navailable to drive endothermic reactions that produce heavier elements as well.\nEXERCISE E If the Sun is generating a constant amount of energy via fusion, the mass\nof the Sun must be (a) increasing, (b) decreasing, (c) constant, (d) irregular.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nFusion energy reactors\nPossible Fusion Reactors\nThe possibility of utilizing the energy released in fusion to make a power reactor\nis very attractive. The fusion reactions most likely to succeed in a reactor involve\nthe isotopes of hydrogen, 2H (deuterium) and 3H (tritium), and are as follows,\nwith the energy released given in parentheses:\n2H + H -> 3H + H\n(4.03 MeV)\n(31-8a)\nRH + AH -> 3He + n\n(3.27 MeV)\n(31-8b)\n2H + 3H -> 4He + n.\n(17.59 MeV)\n(31-8c)\nComparing these energy yields with that for the fission of 232U, we can see that the\nenergy released in fusion reactions can be greater for a given mass of fuel than in\nfission. Furthermore, as fuel, a fusion reactor could use deuterium, which is very\nplentiful in the water of the oceans (the natural abundance of 2H is 0.0115% on\naverage, or about 1 g of deuterium per 80 L of water). The simple proton-proton\nreaction of Eq. 31-6a, which could use a much more plentiful source of fuel,\n1H, has such a small probability of occurring that it cannot be considered a possi-\nbility on Earth.\nAlthough a useful fusion reactor has not yet been achieved, considerable\nprogress has been made in overcoming the inherent difficulties. The problems are\nassociated with the fact that all nuclei have a positive charge and repel each other.\nHowever, if they can be brought close enough together so that the short-range\nattractive strong nuclear force can come into play, it can pull the nuclei together\nand fusion can occur. For the nuclei to get close enough together, they must have\nlarge kinetic energy to overcome the electric repulsion. High kinetic energies are\nreadily attainable with particle accelerators (Chapter 32), but the number of parti-\ncles involved is too small. To produce realistic amounts of energy, we must deal\nwith matter in bulk, for which high kinetic energy means higher temperatures.\n896 CHAPTER 31 Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Indeed, very high temperatures are required for sustained fusion to occur, and\nfusion devices are often referred to as thermonuclear devices. The interiors of the\nSun and other stars are very hot, many millions of degrees, so the nuclei are\nmoving fast enough for fusion to take place, and the energy released keeps the\ntemperature high so that further fusion reactions can occur. The Sun and the stars\nrepresent huge self-sustaining thermonuclear reactors that stay together because\nof their great gravitational mass. But on Earth, containment of the fast-moving\nnuclei at the high temperatures and densities required has proven difficult.\nIt was realized after World War II that the temperature produced within a\nfission (or "atomic") bomb was close to 108 K. This suggested that a fission bomb\ncould be used to ignite a fusion bomb (popularly known as a thermonuclear or\nhydrogen bomb) to release the vast energy of fusion. The uncontrollable release\nof fusion energy in an H-bomb (in 1952) was relatively easy to obtain. But to\nrealize usable energy from fusion at a slow and controlled rate has turned out to\nbe a serious challenge.\nEXAMPLE 31-9\nESTIMATE\nTemperature needed for d-t fusion.\nEstimate the temperature required for deuterium-tritium fusion (d-t) to occur.\nAPPROACH We assume the nuclei approach head-on, each with kinetic energy KE,\nand that the nuclear force comes into play when the distance between their cen-\nters equals the sum of their nuclear radii.

Reasonable estimates for a usable\nfusion reactor are in the range T ≥ 1 to 4 × 108 K.\nA high temperature is required for a fusion reactor. But there must also be\na high density of nuclei to ensure a sufficiently high collision rate. A real diffi-\nculty with controlled fusion is to contain nuclei long enough and at a high\nenough density for sufficient reactions to occur so that a usable amount of\nenergy is obtained. At the temperatures needed for fusion, the atoms are ionized,\nand the resulting collection of nuclei and electrons is referred to as a plasma.\nOrdinary materials vaporize at a few thousand degrees at most, and hence cannot\nbe used to contain a high-temperature plasma. Two major containment techniques\nare magnetic confinement and inertial confinement.\nCurrent-carrying wires\nIn magnetic confinement, magnetic fields are used to try to contain the hot\nplasma. A simple approach is the "magnetic bottle" shown in Fig. 31-13. The\npaths of the charged particles in the plasma are bent by the magnetic field; where\nmagnetic field lines are close together, the force on the particles reflects them\nMagnetic field lines\nPlasma\nFIGURE 31-13 "Magnetic bottle"\nused to confine a plasma.\nSECTION 31-3 Nuclear Fusion 897\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Torus\nvacuum\nchamber\nFIGURE 31-14 Tokamak\nconfiguration, showing the total ₿\nfield due to external current plus\ncurrent in the plasma itself.\nBtoroidal\ni\nB poloidal\nExternal\ncurrent\nBtotal\nPlasma\nPlasma\ncurrent\nFIGURE 31-15 (a) Tokamak: split\nimage view of the Joint European\nTorus (JET) located near Oxford,\nEngland.

Unfortunately, magnetic bottles develop "leaks" and\nthe charged particles slip out before sufficient fusion takes place. The most\npromising design today is the tokamak, first developed in Russia. A tokamak\n(Fig. 31-14) is toroid-shaped (a torus, which is like a donut) and involves compli-\ncated magnetic fields: current-carrying conductors produce a magnetic field\ndirected along the axis of the toroid ("toroidal" field); an additional field is pro-\nduced by currents within the plasma itself ("poloidal" field). The combination\nproduces a helical field as shown in Fig. 31-14, confining the plasma, at least\nbriefly, so it doesn\'t touch the vacuum chamber\'s metal walls (Fig. 31-15a).\nIn 1957, J. D. Lawson showed that the product of ion density n (= ions/m3)\nand confinement time T must exceed a minimum value of approximately\nnT ≥ 3 ×1020 s/m3.\nThis Lawson criterion must be reached to produce ignition, meaning fusion that\ncontinues after all external heating is turned off. Practically, it is expected to be\nachieved with n ~ 1 to 3 × 1020 m3 and T ~ 1 to 3 s. To reach break-even, the\npoint at which the energy output due to fusion is equal to the energy input to heat\nthe plasma, requires an nT about an order of magnitude less. The break-even\npoint was very closely approached in the 1990s at the Tokamak Fusion Test\nReactor (TFTR) at Princeton, and the very high temperature needed for ignition\n(4 × 108 K) was exceeded-although not both of these at the same time.\nMagnetic confinement fusion research continues throughout the world. This\nresearch will help us in developing the huge multinational test device (European\nUnion, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, China, and the U.S.), called ITER\n(International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), situated in France. It is\nexpected that ITER will produce temperatures above 108 K for extended periods\n(minutes or hours) and to begin running by 2020s, with an expected power output\nof about 500 MW, 10 times the input energy. ITER is planned to be the final\nresearch step before building a working reactor.\nThe second method for containing the fuel for fusion is inertial confinement\nfusion (ICF): a small pellet or capsule of deuterium and tritium (Fig. 31-15b) is\nstruck simultaneously from hundreds of directions by very intense laser beams. The\nintense influx of energy heats and ionizes the pellet into a plasma, compressing\nit and heating it to temperatures at which fusion can occur (>108 K). The\nconfinement time is on the order of 10-11 to 10-9 s, during which time the ions do\nnot move appreciably because of their own inertia, and fusion can take place.\n31-4 Passage of Radiation Through\nMatter; Biological Damage\nWhen we speak of radiation, we include a, B, Y, and X-rays, as well as protons,\nneutrons, and other particles such as pions (see Chapter 32). Because charged\nparticles can ionize the atoms or molecules of any material they pass through, they\nare referred to as ionizing radiation. And because radiation produces ionization,\nit can cause considerable damage to materials, particularly to biological tissue.\n898 CHAPTER 31 Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Charged particles, such as a and B rays and protons, cause ionization because\nof electric forces. That is, when they pass through a material, they can attract or\nrepel electrons strongly enough to remove them from the atoms of the material.\nSince the a and B rays emitted by radioactive substances have energies on the\norder of 1 MeV (104 to 107 eV), whereas ionization of atoms and molecules\nrequires on the order of 10 eV (Chapter 27), we see that a single a or ß particle\ncan cause thousands of ionizations.\nNeutral particles also give rise to ionization when they pass through materials.\nFor example, X-ray and Y-ray photons can ionize atoms by knocking out electrons\nby means of the photoelectric and Compton effects (Chapter 27). Furthermore, if\na Y ray has sufficient energy (greater than 1.02 MeV), it can undergo pair pro-\nduction: an electron and a positron are produced (Section 27-6). The charged\nparticles produced in all of these processes can themselves go on to produce further\nionization. Neutrons, on the other hand, interact with matter mainly by collisions\nwith nuclei, with which they interact strongly. Often the nucleus is broken apart by\nsuch a collision, altering the molecule of which it was a part. The fragments\nproduced can in turn cause ionization.\nRadiation passing through matter can do considerable damage. Metals and\nother structural materials become brittle and their strength can be weakened if\nthe radiation is very intense, as in nuclear reactor power plants and for space\nvehicles that must pass through areas of intense cosmic radiation.\nBiological Damage\nThe radiation damage produced in biological organisms is due primarily to ion-\nization produced in cells. Several related processes can occur. Ions or radicals are\nproduced that are highly reactive and take part in chemical reactions that interfere\nwith the normal operation of the cell. All forms of radiation can ionize atoms by\nknocking out electrons. If these are bonding electrons, the molecule may break\napart, or its structure may be altered so that it does not perform its normal function\nor may perform a harmful function. In the case of proteins, the loss of one molecule\nis not serious if there are other copies of the protein in the cell and additional copies\ncan be made from the gene that codes for it. However, large doses of radiation may\ndamage so many molecules that new copies cannot be made quickly enough, and\nthe cell dies.\nDamage to the DNA is more serious, since a cell may have only one copy.\nEach alteration in the DNA can affect a gene and alter the molecule that gene\ncodes for (Section 29-3), so that needed proteins or other molecules may not be\nmade at all. Again the cell may die. The death of a single cell is not normally a\nproblem, since the body can replace it with a new one. (There are exceptions,\nsuch as neurons, which are mostly not replaceable, so their loss is serious.) But if\nmany cells die, the organism may not be able to recover. On the other hand, a cell\nmay survive but be defective. It may go on dividing and produce many more\ndefective cells, to the detriment of the whole organism. Thus radiation can cause\ncancer-the rapid uncontrolled production of cells.\nThe possible damage done by the medical use of X-rays and other radiation\nmust be balanced against the medical benefits and prolongation of life as a result\nof their diagnostic use.\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nBiological radiation damage\n31-5 Measurement of Radiation-\nDosimetry\nAlthough the passage of ionizing radiation through the human body can cause\nconsiderable damage, radiation can also be used to treat certain diseases, particu-\nlarly cancer, often by using very narrow beams directed at a cancerous tumor in\norder to destroy it (Section 31-6). It is therefore important to be able to quantify\nthe amount, or dose, of radiation.

Although the curie is still in common use, the SI unit for source\nactivity is the becquerel (Bq), defined as\n1 Bq = 1 decay/s.\nCommercial suppliers of radionuclides (radioactive nuclides) used as tracers spec-\nify the activity at a given time. Because the activity decreases over time, more so\nfor short-lived isotopes, it is important to take this decrease into account.\nThe magnitude of the source activity, AN/At, is related to the number of\nradioactive nuclei present, N, and to the half-life, T), by (see Section 30-8):\nAX = AN = 0.693 N.\nEXAMPLE 31-10\nRadioactivity taken up by cells. In a certain experiment,\n0.016 Ci of 33P is injected into a medium containing a culture of bacteria. After\n1.0 h the cells are washed and a 70% efficient detector (counts 70% of emitted\nB rays) records 720 counts per minute from the cells. What percentage of the\noriginal 32P was taken up by the cells?\nAPPROACH The half-life of 33P is about 14 days (Appendix B), so we can ignore\nany loss of activity over 1 hour. From the given activity, we find how many ß rays\nare emitted. We can compare 70% of this to the (720/min)/(60 s/min) = 12 per\nsecond detected.\nSOLUTION The total number of decays per second originally was\n(0.016 × 10-6)(3.7× 1010) = 590. The counter could be expected to count 70%\nof this, or 410 per second. Since it counted 720/60 = 12 per second, then\n12/410 = 0.029 or 2.9% was incorporated into the cells.\nAnother type of measurement is the exposure or absorbed dose-that is, the\neffect the radiation has on the absorbing material. The earliest unit of dosage was\nthe roentgen (R), defined in terms of the amount of ionization produced by the\nradiation (1 R = 1.6 × 1012 ion pairs per gram of dry air at standard conditions).\nToday, 1 R is defined as the amount of X-ray or Y radiation that deposits\n0.878 × 10-2 J of energy per kilogram of air. The roentgen was largely super-\nseded by another unit of absorbed dose applicable to any type of radiation, the\nrad: 1 rad is that amount of radiation which deposits energy per unit mass of\n1.00 × 10-2 J/kg in any absorbing material. (This is quite close to the roentgen\nfor X- and Y rays.) The proper SI unit for absorbed dose is the gray (Gy):\n1 Gy = 1 J/kg = 100 rad.\n(31-9)\nThe absorbed dose depends not only on the energy per particle and on the strength\nof a given source or of a radiation beam (number of particles per second), but\nalso on the type of material that is absorbing the radiation. Bone, for example,\nabsorbs more of X-ray or Y radiation normally used than does flesh, so the same\nbeam passing through a human body deposits a greater dose (in rads or grays) in\nbone than in flesh.\nThe gray and the rad are physical units of dose-the energy deposited per\nunit mass of material. They are, however, not the most meaningful units for\nmeasuring the biological damage produced by radiation because equal doses of\ndifferent types of radiation cause differing amounts of damage. For example,\n1 rad of a radiation does 10 to 20 times the amount of damage as 1 rad of ß or\nY rays. This difference arises largely because a rays (and other heavy particles\nsuch as protons and neutrons) move much more slowly than ß and Y rays of equal\nenergy due to their greater mass. Hence, ionizing collisions occur closer together,\n900 CHAPTER 31 Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'so more irreparable damage can be done. The relative biological effectiveness\n(RBE) of a given type of radiation is defined as the number of rads of X-ray or\nY radiation that produces the same biological damage as 1 rad of the given\nradiation. For example, 1 rad of slow neutrons does the same damage as 5 rads of\nX-rays. Table 31-1 gives the RBE for several types of radiation. The numbers are\napproximate because they depend somewhat on the energy of the particles and\non the type of damage that is used as the criterion.\nThe effective dose can be given as the product of the dose in rads and the\nRBE, and this unit is known as the rem (which stands for rad equivalent man):\neffective dose (in rem) = dose (in rad) × RBE.\n(31-10a)\nThis unit is being replaced by the SI unit for "effective dose," the sievert (Sv):\neffective dose (Sv) = dose (Gy) × RBE\n(31-10b)\nSO\n1 Sv = 100 rem\nor\n1 rem = 10 mSv.\nBy these definitions, 1 rem (or 1 Sv) of any type of radiation does approximately\nthe same amount of biological damage. For example, 50 rem of fast neutrons does\nthe same damage as 50 rem of Y rays. But note that 50 rem of fast neutrons is only\n5 rads, whereas 50 rem of Y rays is 50 rads.\nHuman Exposure to Radiation\nWe are constantly exposed to low-level radiation from natural sources: cosmic\nrays, natural radioactivity in rocks and soil, and naturally occurring radioactive\nisotopes in our food, such as 19K. Radon, 232Rn, is of considerable concern today.\nIt is the product of radium decay and is an intermediate in the decay series from\nuranium (see Fig. 30-11). Most intermediates remain in the rocks where formed,\nbut radon is a gas that can escape from rock (and from building material like\nconcrete) to enter the air we breathe, and damage the interior of the lung.\nThe natural radioactive background averages about 0.30 rem (300 mrem) per\nyear per person in the U.S., although there are large variations. From medical\nX-rays and scans, the average person receives about 50 to 60 mrem per year, giving\nan average total dose of about 360 mrem (3.6 mSv) per person. U.S. government\nregulators suggest an upper limit of allowed radiation for an individual in the\ngeneral populace at about 100 mrem (1 mSv) per year in addition to natural back-\nground. It is believed that even low doses of radiation increase the chances of\ncancer or genetic defects; there is no safe level or threshold of radiation exposure.\nThe upper limit for people who work around radiation-in hospitals, in\npower plants, in research-has been set higher, a maximum of 20 mSv (2 rem)\nwhole-body dose, averaged over some years (a maximum of 50 mSv (5 rem/yr) in\nany one year). To monitor exposure, those people who work around radiation\ngenerally carry some type of dosimeter, one common type being a radiation film\nbadge which is a piece of film wrapped in light-tight material. The passage of\nionizing radiation through the film changes it so that the film is darkened upon\ndevelopment, and thus indicates the received dose. Newer types include the\nthermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD). Dosimeters and badges do not protect the\nworker, but high levels detected suggest reassignment or modified work practices\nto reduce radiation exposure to acceptable levels.\nLarge doses of radiation can cause unpleasant symptoms such as nausea,\nfatigue, and loss of body hair, because of cellular damage. Such effects are some-\ntimes referred to as radiation sickness. Very large doses can be fatal, although the\ntime span of the dose is important. A brief dose of 10 Sv (1000 rem) is nearly\nalways fatal. A 3-Sv (300-rem) dose in a short period of time is fatal in about\n50% of patients within a month. However, the body possesses remarkable repair\nprocesses, so that a 3-Sv dose spread over several weeks is usually not fatal. It\nwill, nonetheless, cause considerable damage to the body.\nThe effects of low doses over a long time are difficult to determine and are\nnot well known as yet.\nTABLE 31-1 Relative\nBiological Effectiveness (RBE)\nType\nRBE\nX- and Y rays\n1\nB (electrons)\n1\nProtons\n2\nSlow neutrons\n5\nFast neutrons\n~10\na particles and\nheavy ions\n≥20\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nRadon\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHuman radiation exposure\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nRadiation worker exposure\nFilm badge\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nRadiation sickness\nSECTION 31-5 Measurement of Radiation-Dosimetry 901\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': "1\n4.0 m\nFIGURE 31-16 Radiation spreads\nout in all directions.

If the worker is able to work farther away from\nthe source, how much farther away is necessary?\nRESPONSE If the energy is radiated uniformly in all directions, then the\nintensity (dose/area) should decrease as the distance squared, just as it does for\nsound and light. If she can work four times farther away, the exposure lowers by\na factor of sixteen, enough to make her safe.\nEXAMPLE 31-12\nWhole-body dose.

Approximately 50% of the Y rays interact in the body and\ndeposit all their energy. (The rest pass through.)\nAPPROACH Of the given energy emitted, only a fraction passes through the\nworker, equal to her area divided by the total area (or 4Trr2) over a full sphere of\nradius r = 4.0 m (Fig. 31-16).\nSOLUTION The total Y-ray energy per decay is (1.33 + 1.17) MeV = 2.50 MeV,\nso the total energy emitted by the source per second is\n(0.040 Ci)(3.7 × 1010 decays/Ci ·s)(2.50 MeV) = 3.7 × 109 MeV/s.\nThe proportion of this energy intercepted by the body is its 1.5-m2 area divided\nby the area of a sphere of radius 4.0 m (Fig. 31-16):\n=\n1.5 m2\n= 7.5×10-3.\n47772\n1.5 m2\n4TT (4.0 m)2\nSo the rate energy is deposited in the body (remembering that only 50% of the\nY rays interact in the body) is\nE = (+)(7.5×10-3)(3.7×109 MeV/s)(1.6×10-13 J/MeV) = 2.2×10-6J/s.\nSince 1 Gy = 1 J/kg, the whole-body dose rate for this 70-kg person is\n(2.2 × 10-6 J/s)/(70 kg) = 3.1 × 10-8 Gy/s. In 4.0 h, this amounts to a dose of\n(4.0h)(3600 s/h)(3.1 × 10-8 Gy/s) = 4.5 × 10-4 Gy.\nRBE ~ 1 for gammas, so the effective dose is 450 uSv (Eqs. 31-10b and 31-9)\nor:\n(100 rad/Gy)(4.5 × 10-4 Gy)(1 rem/rad) = 45 mrem = 0.45 mSv.\nNOTE This 45-mrem effective dose is almost 50% of the normal allowed dose\nfor a whole year (100 mrem/yr), or 1% of the maximum one-year allowance for\nradiation workers. This worker should not receive such a large dose every day\nand should seek ways to reduce it (shield the source, vary the work, work\nfarther from the source, work less time this close to source, etc.).\nWe have assumed that the intensity of radiation decreases as the square of the\ndistance. It actually falls off faster than 1/r2 because of absorption in the air, so\nour answers are a slight overestimate of dose received.\nEXAMPLE 31-13\nRadon exposure. In the U.S., yearly deaths from radon\nexposure (the second leading cause of lung cancer) are estimated to be on the\norder of 20,000 and maybe much more.

In some areas 50% of houses exceed this level from nat-\nurally occurring radon in the soil.

It can also be used to treat it. Rapidly growing\ncancer cells are especially susceptible to destruction by radiation. Nonetheless,\nlarge doses are needed to kill the cancer cells, and some of the surrounding\nnormal cells are inevitably killed as well. It is for this reason that cancer patients\nreceiving radiation therapy often suffer side effects characteristic of radiation\nsickness. To minimize the destruction of normal cells, a narrow beam of Y or\nX-rays is often used when a cancerous tumor is well localized. The beam is\ndirected at the tumor, and the source (or body) is rotated so that the beam passes\nthrough various parts of the body to keep the dose at any one place as low as\npossible-except at the tumor and its immediate surroundings, where the beam\npasses at all times (Fig. 31-17). The radiation may be from a radioactive source\nsuch as 2Co, or it may be from an X-ray machine that produces photons in\nthe range 200 keV to 5 MeV. Protons, neutrons, electrons, and pions, which are\nproduced in particle accelerators (Section 32-1), are also being used in cancer\ntherapy.\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nRadiation therapy\n1\n-\n-\nFIGURE 31-17 Radiation source\nrotates so that the beam always\npasses through the diseased tissue,\nbut minimizes the dose in the rest of\nthe body.\n*SECTION 31-6 Radiation Therapy 903\n", 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': '100 +\nFIGURE 31-18 Energy deposited in tissue\nas a function of depth for 170-MeV protons\n(red curve) and 190-MeV protons (green).\nThe peak of each curve is often called the\nBragg peak.\n75 +\nRelative dose\n50 +\n25 +\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nProton therapy\n0\nO\n-in\n10\n15\n20\nDepth in tissue (cm)\nProtons used to kill tumors have a special property that makes them particu-\nlarly useful. As shown in Fig. 31-18, when protons enter tissue, most of their\nenergy is deposited at the end of their path. The protons\' initial kinetic energy\ncan be chosen so that most of the energy is deposited at the depth of the tumor\nitself, to destroy it. The incoming protons deposit only a small amount of energy\nin the tissue in front of the tumor, and none at all behind the tumor, thus having\nless negative effect on healthy tissue than X- or Y rays. Because tumors have\nphysical size, even several centimeters in diameter, a range of proton energies is\noften used. Heavier ions, such as a particles or carbon ions, are similarly useful.\nThis proton therapy technique is more than a half century old, but the necessity\nof having a large accelerator has meant that few hospitals have used the tech-\nnique until now. Many such "proton centers" are now being built.\nAnother form of treatment is to insert a tiny radioactive source directly\ninside a tumor, which will eventually kill the majority of the cells. A similar\ntechnique is used to treat cancer of the thyroid with the radioactive isotope 13JI.\nThe thyroid gland concentrates iodine present in the bloodstream, particularly in\nany area where abnormal growth is taking place. Its intense radioactivity can\ndestroy the defective cells.\nAnother application of radiation is for sterilizing bandages, surgical equipment,\nand even packaged foods such as ground beef, chicken, and produce, because\nbacteria and viruses can be killed or deactivated by large doses of radiation.\n*\n31-7 Tracers in Research and\nMedicine\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 31-19 (a) Autoradiograph\nof a leaf exposed for 30 s to 14CO2.\nOnly the tissue where the CO2\nhas been taken up, to be used in\nphotosynthesis (Example 27-7), has\nbecome radioactive.

The dashed\narrays of film grains show the\nY-shaped growing point of\nreplicating DNA.\nRadioactive isotopes are used in biological and medical research as tracers.\nA given compound is artificially synthesized incorporating a radioactive isotope\nsuch as 14C or 3H. Such "tagged" molecules can then be traced as they move\nthrough an organism or as they undergo chemical reactions. The presence of\nthese tagged molecules (or parts of them, if they undergo chemical change) can\nbe detected by a Geiger or scintillation counter, which detects emitted radiation\n(see Section 30-13). How food molecules are digested, and to what parts of the\nbody they are diverted, can be traced in this way.\nRadioactive tracers have been used to determine how amino acids and other\nessential compounds are synthesized by organisms. The permeability of cell walls\nto various molecules and ions can be determined using radioactive tracers: the\ntagged molecule or ion is injected into the extracellular fluid, and the radioactivity\npresent inside and outside the cells is measured as a function of time.\nIn a technique known as autoradiography, the position of the radioactive\nisotopes is detected on film. For example, the distribution of carbohydrates\nproduced in the leaves of plants from absorbed CO2 can be observed by keeping\nthe plant in an atmosphere where the carbon atom in the CO2 is 14C. After a time,\na leaf is placed firmly on a photographic plate and the emitted radiation darkens\nthe film most strongly where the isotope is most strongly concentrated (Fig. 31-19a).\nAutoradiography using labeled nucleotides (components of DNA) has revealed\nmuch about the details of DNA replication (Fig. 31-19b). Today gamma cameras\nare used in a similar way-see next page.\n904 CHAPTER 31\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'For medical diagnosis, the radionuclide commonly used today is 999\n43 Tc,\na long-lived excited state of technetium-99 (the "m" in the symbol stands for\n"metastable" state). It is formed when 22Mo decays. The great usefulness of\n45 Tc derives from its convenient half-life of 6 h (short, but not too short) and the\nfact that it can combine with a large variety of compounds. The compound to be\nlabeled with the radionuclide is so chosen because it concentrates in the organ or\nregion of the anatomy to be studied. Detectors outside the body then record, or\nimage, the distribution of the radioactively labeled compound. The detection\ncould be done by a single detector (Fig. 31-20a) which is moved across the body,\nmeasuring the intensity of radioactivity at a large number of points. The image\nrepresents the relative intensity of radioactivity at each point. The relative\nradioactivity is a diagnostic tool. For example, high or low radioactivity may\nrepresent overactivity or underactivity of an organ or part of an organ, or in\nanother case may represent a lesion or tumor. More complex gamma cameras\nmake use of many detectors which simultaneously record the radioactivity at\nmany points. The measured intensities can be displayed on a TV or computer\nmonitor. The image is sometimes called a scintigram (after scintillator),\nFig. 31-20b. Gamma cameras are relatively inexpensive, but their resolution is\nlimited-by non-perfect collimation *.

It is also possible to image the radioactive\nemissions from a single plane or slice through the body using the computed\ntomography techniques discussed in Section 25-12. A gamma camera measures\nthe radioactive intensity from the tracer at many points and angles around the\npatient. The data are processed in much the same way as for X-ray CT scans\n(Section 25-12). This technique is referred to as single photon emission computed\ntomography (SPECT), or simply SPET (single photon emission tomography).\nAnother important technique is positron emission tomography (PET),\nwhich makes use of positron emitters such as 11C, 13N, 150, and 18F whose half-\nlives are short. These isotopes are incorporated into molecules that, when\ninhaled or injected, accumulate in the organ or region of the body to be studied.\n*To "collimate" means to "make parallel," usually by blocking non-parallel rays with a narrow tube\ninside lead, as in Fig. 31-20a.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nMedical imaging\n*\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nEmission tomography\n(SPECT, PET)\n*SECTION 31-8 Emission Tomography: PET and SPECT 905\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 22, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Ring of\ndetectors\n, ==\nY\nFIGURE 31-21 Positron emission\ntomography (PET) system showing\na ring of detectors to detect the two\nannihilation Y rays (e+ + e- - > 2Y)\nemitted at 180° to each other.\nWhen such a nuclide undergoes B+ decays, the emitted positron travels at most\na few millimeters before it collides with a normal electron. In this collision, the\npositron and electron are annihilated, producing two Y rays (e+ + e" -> 27),\neach having an energy of 511 keV (= mec2). The two Y rays fly off in opposite\ndirections (180° + 0.25°) since they must have almost exactly equal and opposite\nmomenta to conserve momentum (the momenta of the initial e+ and e" are essen-\ntially zero compared to the momenta afterward of the Y rays). Because the photons\ntravel along the same line in opposite directions, their detection in coincidence\nby rings of detectors surrounding the patient (Fig. 31-21) readily establishes\nthe line along which the emission took place. If the difference in time of arrival\nof the two photons could be determined accurately, the actual position of the\nemitting nuclide along that line could be calculated. Present-day electronics can\nmeasure times to at best + 300 ps, so at the Y ray\'s speed (c = 3 × 108 m/s),\nthe actual position could be determined to an accuracy on the order of about\nd= vt ~ (3×108 m/s)(300× 10-12 s) ~ 10 cm, which is not very useful. Although\nthere may be future potential for time-of-flight measurements to determine\nposition, today computed tomography techniques are used instead, similar to\nthose for X-ray CT, which can reconstruct PET images with a resolution on the\norder of 2-5 mm. One big advantage of PET is that no collimators are needed\n(as for detection of a single photon-see Fig. 31-20a). Thus, fewer photons are\n"wasted" and lower doses can be administered to the patient with PET.\nBoth PET and SPECT systems can give images that relate to biochemistry,\nmetabolism, and function. This is to be compared to X-ray CT scans, whose images\nreflect shape and structure-that is, the anatomy of the imaged region.\nFigure 31-22 shows PET scans of the same person\'s brain (a) when using a\ncell phone near the ear and (b) with the cell phone off.

It is also an important medical imaging technique.\nWe first briefly discuss the phenomenon, and then look at its applications.\n*\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)\nWe saw in Chapter 28 (Section 28-6) that when atoms are placed in a magnetic\nfield, atomic energy levels split into several closely spaced levels (see Fig. 28-8).\nNuclei, too, exhibit these magnetic properties. We examine only the simplest, the\nhydrogen (H) nucleus, since it is the one most used, even for medical imaging.\n906 CHAPTER 31 Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 23, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The 1H nucleus consists of a single proton. Its spin angular momentum (and its\nmagnetic moment), like that of the electron, can take on only two values when\nplaced in a magnetic field: we call these "spin up" (parallel to the field) and "spin\ndown" (antiparallel to the field), as suggested in Fig. 31-23. When a magnetic\nfield is present, the energy of the nucleus splits into two levels as shown in\nFig. 31-24, with the spin up (parallel to field) having the lower energy. (This is\nlike the Zeeman effect for atomic levels, Fig. 28-8.) The difference in energy AE\nbetween these two levels is proportional to the total magnetic field Br at the\nnucleus:\nAE = kBT,\nwhere k is a proportionality constant that is different for different nuclides.\nIn a standard nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) setup, the sample to be\nexamined is placed in a static magnetic field. A radiofrequency (RF) pulse of\nelectromagnetic radiation (that is, photons) is applied to the sample. If the\nfrequency, f, of this pulse corresponds precisely to the energy difference between\nthe two energy levels (Fig. 31-24), so that\nhf = AE = kBT,\n(31-11)\nthen the photons of the RF beam will be absorbed, exciting many of the nuclei\nfrom the lower state to the upper state. This is a resonance phenomenon because\nthere is significant absorption only if f is very near f = kBT/h. Hence the name\n"nuclear magnetic resonance." For free 1H nuclei, the frequency is 42.58 MHz for\na magnetic field BT = 1.0 T. If the H atoms are bound in a molecule the total\nmagnetic field Br at the H nuclei will be the sum of the external applied field\n(Bext) plus the local magnetic field (Blocal) due to electrons and nuclei of neigh-\nboring atoms. Since f is proportional to Br, the value of f for a given external\nfield will be slightly different for bound H atoms than for free atoms:\nhf = k(Bext + Blocal).\nThis small change in frequency can be measured, and is called the "chemical\nshift." A great deal has been learned about the structure of molecules and bonds\nusing this NMR technique.\n*\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\nFor producing medically useful NMR images-now commonly called MRI, or\nmagnetic resonance imaging-the element most used is hydrogen since it is the\ncommonest element in the human body and gives the strongest NMR signals.\nThe experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 31-25. The large coils set up the\nstatic magnetic field, and the RF coils produce the RF pulse of electromagnetic\nwaves (photons) that cause the nuclei to jump from the lower state to the upper\none (Fig. 31-24). These same coils (or another coil) can detect the absorption of\nenergy or the emitted radiation (also of frequency f = AE/h, Eq. 31-11) when\nthe nuclei jump back down to the lower state.\nMagnetic\nfield coils\nRF coils\n(a)\n(b)\nB\nUp\nDown\nFIGURE 31-23 Schematic picture\nof a proton in a magnetic field B\n(pointing upward) with the two\npossible states of proton spin, up\nand down.\nFIGURE 31-24 Energy Eo in the\nabsence of a magnetic field splits\ninto two levels in the presence of a\nmagnetic field.\nSpin\ndown\n/\nY\nEo\n(B = 0)\nhf = AE\nSpin\nup\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nNMR imaging (MRI)\nFIGURE 31-25 NMR imaging\nsetup: (a) diagram;\n(b) photograph.\nSECTION 31-9 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 907\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 24, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'B low\nB high\nf high\nPatient\nflow\nFIGURE 31-26 A static field that is\nstronger at the bottom than at the\ntop. The frequency of absorbed or\nemitted radiation is proportional to\nB in NMR.\nFIGURE 31-27 False-color NMR\nimage (MRI) through the head\nshowing structures in the brain.\nThe formation of a two-dimensional or three-dimensional image can be done\nusing techniques similar to those for computed tomography (Section 25-12). The\nsimplest thing to measure for creating an image is the intensity of absorbed\nand/or reemitted radiation from many different points of the body, and this\nwould be a measure of the density of H atoms at each point. But how do we\ndetermine from what part of the body a given photon comes? One technique is\nto give the static magnetic field a gradient; that is, instead of applying a uniform\nmagnetic field, BT, the field is made to vary with position across the width of the\nsample (or patient), Fig. 31-26. Because the frequency absorbed by the H nuclei\nis proportional to BT (Eq. 31-11), only one plane within the body will have the\nproper value of Br to absorb photons of a particular frequency f. By varying f,\nabsorption by different planes can be measured. Alternately, if the field\ngradient is applied after the RF pulse, the frequency of the emitted photons\nwill be a measure of where they were emitted. If a magnetic field gradient\nin one direction is applied during excitation (absorption of photons) and photons\nof a single frequency are transmitted, only H nuclei in one thin slice will be\nexcited. By applying a gradient during reemission in a direction perpendicular to\nthe first, the frequency f of the reemitted radiation will represent depth in that\nslice. Other ways of varying the magnetic field throughout the volume of the\nbody can be used in order to correlate NMR frequency with position.\nA reconstructed image based on the density of H atoms (that is, the intensity\nof absorbed or emitted radiation) is not very interesting. More useful are images\nbased on the rate at which the nuclei decay back to the ground state, and such\nimages can produce resolution of 1 mm or better. This NMR technique (some-\ntimes called spin-echo) produces images of great diagnostic value, both in the\ndelineation of structure (anatomy) and in the study of metabolic processes. An\nNMR image is shown in Fig. 31-27.\nNMR imaging is considered to be noninvasive. We can calculate the\nenergy of the photons involved: as mentioned above, in a 1.0-T magnetic\nfield, f = 42.58 MHz for 1H. This corresponds to an energy of hf =\n(6.6 × 10-34 J.s)(43 × 106 Hz) ~ 3 × 10-26 J or about 10-7 eV. Since molecular\nbonds are on the order of 1 eV, the RF photons can cause little cellular disrup-\ntion. This should be compared to X- or Y rays, whose energies are 104 to 106 eV\nand thus can cause significant damage. The static magnetic fields, though often\nlarge (as high as 1.0 to 1.5 T), are believed to be harmless (except for people who\nwear heart pacemakers).\nTABLE 31-2 Medical Imaging Techniques\nTechnique\nWhere Discussed\nin This Book\nOptimal Resolution\nConventional X-ray\nSection 25-12\n¿mm\nCT scan, X-ray\nSection 25-12\n2 mm\nNuclear medicine (tracers)\nSection 31-7\n1 cm\nSPECT (single photon emission)\nSection 31-8\n1 cm\nPET (positron emission)\nSection 31-8\n2-5 mm\nMRI (NMR)\nSection 31-9\n1-1 mm\nUltrasound\nSection 12-9\n0.3-2 mm\nTable 31-2 lists the major techniques we have discussed for imaging the\ninterior of the human body, along with the optimum resolution attainable today.\nResolution is only one factor that must be considered, because the different\nimaging techniques provide different types of information that are useful for\ndifferent types of diagnosis.\n908 CHAPTER 31 Nuclear Energy; Effects and Uses of Radiation\n', 'chapter_title': '31-2 Nuclear Fission; Nuclear Reactors'}, {'page_number': 25, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Summary\nA nuclear reaction occurs when two nuclei collide and two or\nmore other nuclei (or particles) are produced. In this process,\nas in radioactivity, transmutation (change) of elements occurs.\nThe reaction energy or Q-value of a reaction\na + X -> Y + b is\nQ = (Ma + Mx - Mb - My)c2\n(31-2a)\n= KEb + KEY - KEa - KEx.\n(31-2b)\nIn fission, a heavy nucleus such as uranium splits into two\nintermediate-sized nuclei after being struck by a neutron. 235U is\nfissionable by slow neutrons, whereas some fissionable nuclei\nrequire fast neutrons. Much energy is released in fission\n(~ 200 MeV per fission) because the binding energy per\nnucleon is lower for heavy nuclei than it is for intermediate-\nsized nuclei, so the mass of a heavy nucleus is greater than the\ntotal mass of its fission products. The fission process releases\nneutrons, so that a chain reaction is possible. The critical mass\nis the minimum mass of fuel needed so that enough emitted\nneutrons go on to produce more fissions and sustain a chain\nreaction. In a nuclear reactor or nuclear weapon, a moderator\nis used to slow down the released neutrons.\nThe fusion process, in which small nuclei combine to form\nlarger ones, also releases energy. The energy from our Sun origi-\nnates in the fusion reactions known as the proton-proton chain\nin which four protons fuse to form a 2He nucleus producing\n25 MeV of energy. A useful fusion reactor for power generation\nhas not yet proved possible because of the difficulty in containing\nthe fuel (e.g., deuterium) long enough at the extremely high\ntemperature required (~ 108K).

The two main methods are magnetic confinement,\nusing a magnetic field in a device such as the donut-shaped\ntokamak, and inertial confinement in which intense laser beams\ncompress a fuel pellet of deuterium and tritium.\nRadiation can cause damage to materials, including biolog-\nical tissue. Quantifying amounts of radiation is the subject of\ndosimetry. The curie (Ci) and the becquerel (Bq) are units\nthat measure the source activity or rate of decay of a sample:\n1 Ci = 3.70 × 1010 decays per second, whereas 1 Bq = 1 decay/s.\nThe absorbed dose, often specified in rads, measures the amount\nof energy deposited per unit mass of absorbing material: 1 rad\nis the amount of radiation that deposits energy at the rate of\n10-2 J/kg of material. The SI unit of absorbed dose is the gray:\n1 Gy = 1 J/kg = 100 rad. The effective dose is often specified\nby the rem = rad × RBE, where RBE is the "relative bio-\nlogical effectiveness" of a given type of radiation; 1 rem of any\ntype of radiation does approximately the same amount of\nbiological damage. The average dose received per person per\nyear in the United States is about 360 mrem. The SI unit for\neffective dose is the sievert: 1 Sv = 100 rem.\n[*Nuclear radiation is used in medicine for cancer therapy,\nand for imaging of biological structure and processes.\nTomographic imaging of the human body, which can provide\n3-dimensional detail, includes several types: PET, SPET\n(= SPECT), MRI, and CT scans (discussed in Chapter 25).\nMRI makes use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).]\n11.
