A quantity such as velocity, which has\ndirection as well as magnitude, is a vector quantity. Other quantities that are also\nvectors are displacement, force, and momentum. However, many quantities have no\ndirection associated with them, such as mass, time, and temperature. They are speci-\nfied completely by a number and units. Such quantities are called scalar quantities.\nDrawing a diagram of a particular physical situation is always helpful in\nphysics, and this is especially true when dealing with vectors. On a diagram, each\nvector is represented by an arrow. The arrow is always drawn so that it points in\nthe direction of the vector quantity it represents. The length of the arrow is drawn\nproportional to the magnitude of the vector quantity. For example, in Fig. 3-1,\ngreen arrows have been drawn representing the velocity of a car at various places\nas it rounds a curve. The magnitude of the velocity at each point can be read off\nFig. 3-1 by measuring the length of the corresponding arrow and using the scale\nshown (1 cm = 90 km/h).\nWhen we write the symbol for a vector, we will always use boldface type, with a\ntiny arrow over the symbol. Thus for velocity we write v. If we are concerned only\nwith the magnitude of the vector, we will write simply v, in italics, as we do for\nother symbols.\n3-2 Addition of Vectors-Graphical\nMethods\nBecause vectors are quantities that have direction as well as magnitude, they must\nbe added in a special way. In this Chapter, we will deal mainly with displacement\nvectors, for which we now use the symbol D, and velocity vectors, v. But the results\nwill apply for other vectors we encounter later.\nWe use simple arithmetic for adding scalars. Simple arithmetic can also be\nused for adding vectors if they are in the same direction. For example, if a\nperson walks 8 km east one day, and 6 km east the next day, the person will be\n8 km + 6 km = 14 km east of the point of origin. We say that the net or resultant\ndisplacement is 14 km to the east (Fig. 3-2a). If, on the other hand, the person\nwalks 8 km east on the first day, and 6 km west (in the reverse direction) on the\nsecond day, then the person will end up 2 km from the origin (Fig. 3-2b), so the\nresultant displacement is 2 km to the east. In this case, the resultant displacement\nis obtained by subtraction: 8 km - 6 km = 2 km.\nBut simple arithmetic cannot be used if the two vectors are not along the same\nline. For example, suppose a person walks 10.0 km east and then walks 5.0 km\nnorth. These displacements can be represented on a graph in which the positive\ny axis points north and the positive x axis points east, Fig. 3-3. On this graph, we\ndraw an arrow, labeled D1, to represent the 10.0-km displacement to the east.\nThen we draw a second arrow, D2, to represent the 5.0-km displacement to\nthe north. Both vectors are drawn to scale, as in Fig. 3-3.\ny (km)\nNorth\n6 -\nFIGURE 3-3 A person walks 10.0 km east and then 5.0 km\nnorth. These two displacements are represented by the\nvectors D1 and D2, which are shown as arrows. Also shown\nis the resultant displacement vector, DR, which is the\nvector sum of D1 and D2 . Measurement on the graph\nwith ruler and protractor shows that DR has a magnitude\nof 11.2 km and points at an angle 0 = 27° north of east.\nResultant displacement\nDR=D1 + D2\n4\nĎ2\n2\nθ\nĎ1\nWest -+\n0\n- x (km)\nEast\n2\n4\n6 8 10\nSouth\n50 CHAPTER 3 Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': "After taking this walk, the person is now 10.0 km east and 5.0 km north of the\npoint of origin. The resultant displacement is represented by the arrow labeled DR\nin Fig. 3-3. (The subscript R stands for resultant.) Using a ruler and a protractor,\nyou can measure on this diagram that the person is 11.2 km from the origin at an\nangle 0 = 27° north of east. In other words, the resultant displacement vector has\na magnitude of 11.2 km and makes an angle 0 = 27° with the positive x axis. The\nmagnitude (length) of DR can also be obtained using the theorem of Pythagoras\nin this case, because D1, D2, and DR form a right triangle with DR as the\nhypotenuse. Thus\nDR = D + D3 = V (10.0 km)2 + (5.0 km)2\n=\n1125 km2 = 11.2 km.\nYou can use the Pythagorean theorem only when the vectors are perpendicular\nto each other.\nThe resultant displacement vector, DR, is the sum of the vectors D1 and D2 .\nThat is,\nDR = D1 + Ď2.\nThis is a vector equation. An important feature of adding two vectors that are not\nalong the same line is that the magnitude of the resultant vector is not equal to the\nsum of the magnitudes of the two separate vectors, but is smaller than their sum.\nThat is,\nDR S (D1 + D2),\nwhere the equals sign applies only if the two vectors point in the same direction.\nIn our example (Fig. 3-3), DR = 11.2km, whereas D1 + D2 equals 15 km,\nwhich is the total distance traveled. Note also that we cannot set DR equal to\n11.2 km, because we have a vector equation and 11.2 km is only a part of the\nresultant vector, its magnitude. We could write something like this, though:\nDR = D1 + D2 = (11.2 km, 27º N of E).\nFigure 3-3 illustrates the general rules for graphically adding two vectors\ntogether, no matter what angles they make, to get their sum. The rules are as\nfollows:\n1. On a diagram, draw one of the vectors-call it D1-to scale.\n2. Next draw the second vector, D2, to scale, placing its tail at the tip of the\nfirst vector and being sure its direction is correct.\n3. The arrow drawn from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second\nvector represents the sum, or resultant, of the two vectors.\nThe length of the resultant vector represents its magnitude. Note that vectors can\nbe moved parallel to themselves on paper (maintaining the same length and\nangle) to accomplish these manipulations. The length of the resultant can be\nmeasured with a ruler and compared to the scale. Angles can be measured\nwith a protractor. This method is known as the tail-to-tip method of adding\nvectors.\nThe resultant is not affected by the order in which the vectors are added.\nFor example, a displacement of 5.0 km north, to which is added a displacement\nof 10.0 km east, yields a resultant of 11.2 km and angle 0 = 27° (see Fig. 3-4),\nthe same as when they were added in reverse order (Fig. 3-3).

Rather, a minus sign tells us about its direction.\n52 CHAPTER 3 Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'We can now define the subtraction of one vector from another: the difference\nbetween two vectors V2 - V1 is defined as\nV2 - V1 = V2 + (-V1).\nThat is, the difference between two vectors is equal to the sum of the first plus\nthe negative of the second.

If c is a negative scalar (such as -2.0), the magnitude\nof the product cV is changed by the factor |c| (where |c| means the magnitude of c),\nbut the direction is precisely opposite to that of V.

We discuss now a more\npowerful and precise method for adding vectors. But do not forget graphical\nmethods-they are useful for visualizing, for checking your math, and thus for\ngetting the correct result.\nComponents\nConsider first a vector V that lies in a particular plane. It can be expressed as\nthe sum of two other vectors, called the components of the original vector. The\ncomponents are usually chosen to be along two perpendicular directions, such as\nthe x and y axes. The process of finding the components is known as resolving the\nvector into its components. An example is shown in Fig. 3-10; the vector V could\nbe a displacement vector that points at an angle 0 = 30° north of east, where we\nhave chosen the positive x axis to be to the east and the positive y axis north.\nThis vector V is resolved into its x and y components by drawing dashed lines\n(AB and AC) out from the tip (A) of the vector, making them perpendicular to\nthe x and y axes. Then the lines OB and OC represent the x and y components\nof V, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3-10b. These vector components are written\nV and Vy. In this book we usually show vector components as arrows, like vectors,\nbut dashed. The scalar components, Vx and Vy, are the magnitudes of the vector\ncomponents, with units, accompanied by a positive or negative sign depending on\nwhether they point along the positive or negative x or y axis. As can be seen in\nFig. 3-10, Vx + Vy = V by the parallelogram method of adding vectors.\nSpace is made up of three dimensions, and sometimes it is necessary to\nresolve a vector into components along three mutually perpendicular directions.\nIn rectangular coordinates the components are Vx, Vy, and Vz·\ny\nNorth\ny\nNorth\nC\nB\nV\nA\nB\nV\ny\nB\nI\n1\n0 (= 30°)\n0\n1\nX\nB\nEast\n0 (= 30°)\nFIGURE 3-8 Subtracting two\nvectors: V2 - V1 -\nFIGURE 3-9 Multiplying a vector V\nby a scalar c gives a vector whose\nmagnitude is c times greater and in\nthe same direction as V (or opposite\ndirection if c is negative).\nV2 = 1.5 V\nB\nV\nV3 =- 2.0 V\nFIGURE 3-10 Resolving a vector V into its\ncomponents along a chosen set of x and y axes.\nThe components, once found, themselves\nrepresent the vector.

So, the resultant displacement is 30.0 km directed at 38.5°\nin a southeasterly direction.\nNOTE Always be attentive about the quadrant in which the resultant vector\nlies. An electronic calculator does not fully give this information, but a good\ndiagram does.\nAs we saw in Example 3-2, any component that points along the negative x or\ny axis gets a minus sign. The signs of trigonometric functions depend on which\n"quadrant" the angle falls in: for example, the tangent is positive in the first and\nthird quadrants (from 0° to 90°, and 180° to 270°), but negative in the second\nand fourth quadrants; see Appendix A, Fig. A-7.

Now we examine the more general\ntranslational motion of objects moving through the air in two dimensions near the\nEarth\'s surface, such as a golf ball, a thrown or batted baseball, kicked footballs,\nand speeding bullets. These are all examples of projectile motion (see Fig. 3-17),\nwhich we can describe as taking place in two dimensions if there is no wind.\nAlthough air resistance is often important, in many cases its effect can be\nignored, and we will ignore it in the following analysis. We will not be concerned\nnow with the process by which the object is thrown or projected. We consider only\nits motion after it has been projected, and before it lands or is caught-that is,\nwe analyze our projected object only when it is moving freely through the air under\nthe action of gravity alone. Then the acceleration of the object is that due to gravity,\nwhich acts downward with magnitude g = 9.80 m/s2, and we assume it is constant.+\n(a)\nGalileo was the first to describe projectile motion accurately. He showed that\nit could be understood by analyzing the horizontal and vertical components of\nthe motion separately. For convenience, we assume that the motion begins at\ntime t = 0 at the origin of an xy coordinate system (so x0 = y0 = 0 ).\n(b)\nFIGURE 3-17 Photographs of\n(a) a bouncing ball and (b) a thrown\nbasketball, each showing the\ncharacteristic "parabolic" path of\nprojectile motion.\nLet us look at a (tiny) ball rolling off the end of a horizontal table with an\ninitial velocity in the horizontal (x) direction, Vro. See Fig. 3-18, where an object\nfalling vertically is also shown for comparison. The velocity vector v at each instant\npoints in the direction of the ball\'s motion at that instant and is thus always tangent\nto the path. Following Galileo\'s ideas, we treat the horizontal and vertical compo-\nnents of velocity and acceleration separately, and we can apply the kinematic\nequations (Eqs. 2-11a through 2-11c) to the x and y components of the motion.\nFirst we examine the vertical (y) component of the motion. At the instant\nthe ball leaves the table\'s top (t = 0), it has only an x component of velocity.\nOnce the ball leaves the table (at t = 0), it experiences a vertically downward\nacceleration g, the acceleration due to gravity. Thus vy is initially zero (vyo = 0)\nbut increases continually in the downward direction (until the ball hits the\nground). Let us take y to be positive upward. Then the acceleration due to gravity\nis in the -y direction, so dy = - g. From Eq. 2-11a (using y in place of x) we\ncan write Vy = Vyo + ayt = - gt since we set Vyo = 0. The vertical displacement\nis given by Eq. 2-11b written in terms of y: y = yo + Vyo + 2 ay t2.\nGiven yo = 0, Vyo = 0, and dy = - g, then y = - 2gt2.\n*This restricts us to objects whose distance traveled and maximum height above the Earth are small\ncompared to the Earth\'s radius (6400 km).\ny\nv.\nx0\nx\na = g\nFIGURE 3-18 Projectile motion of a small\nball projected horizontally with initial\nvelocity v = Vxo .

Thus, to a person on the ground, the apple will follow the path of\na projectile as shown in Fig. 3-21b. The apple experiences no horizontal accel-\neration, so xo will stay constant and equal to the speed of the wagon. As the\napple follows its arc, the wagon will be directly under the apple at all times\nbecause they have the same horizontal velocity. When the apple comes down, it\nwill drop right into the outstretched hand of the child. The answer is (b).\nEXERCISE E Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 49, and answer it again\nnow.

These equations are shown separately for\nthe x and y components of the motion in Table 3-1, for the general case of two-\ndimensional motion at constant acceleration.

We do not consider\nthe throwing (or projecting) process, nor the time after the object lands or is caught,\nbecause then other influences act on the object, and we can no longer set ã = g.\nROBLEM\nProjectile Motion\nOur approach to solving Problems in Section 2-6 also\napplies here. Solving Problems involving projectile\nmotion can require creativity, and cannot be done just\nby following some rules. Certainly you must avoid just\nplugging numbers into equations that seem to "work."\n1. As always, read carefully; choose the object (or\nobjects) you are going to analyze.\n2. Draw a careful diagram showing what is happening\nto the object.\n3. Choose an origin and an xy coordinate system.\n4. Decide on the time interval, which for projectile\nmotion can only include motion under the effect of\ngravity alone, not throwing or landing. The time inter-\nval must be the same for the x and y analyses. The x\nand y motions are connected by the common time, t.\n5. Examine the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) motions\nseparately. If you are given the initial velocity, you\nmay want to resolve it into its x and y components.\n6. List the known and unknown quantities, choosing\nax = 0 and dy = - g or +g, where g = 9.80 m/s2,\nand using the - or + sign, depending on whether\nyou choose y positive up or down. Remember that\nVx never changes throughout the trajectory, and that\nVy = 0 at the highest point of any trajectory that\nreturns downward. The velocity just before landing is\ngenerally not zero.\n7. Think for a minute before jumping into the equations.\nA little planning goes a long way. Apply the relevant\nequations (Table 3-2), combining equations if neces-\nsary. You may need to combine components of a\nvector to get magnitude and direction (Eqs. 3-4).\n60 CHAPTER 3 Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 3-5\nDriving off a cliff.

Our object is the motor-\ncycle and driver, taken as a single unit. The diagram is shown in Fig. 3-22.\n3. Choose a coordinate system.

Choose a time interval. We choose our time interval to begin (t = 0) just as\nthe motorcycle leaves the cliff top at position x0 = 0, y0 = 0. Our time\ninterval ends just before the motorcycle touches the ground below.\n5. Examine x and y motions. In the horizontal (x) direction, the acceleration\nax = 0, so the velocity is constant. The value of x when the motorcycle\nreaches the ground is x = +90.0 m. In the vertical direction, the accelera-\ntion is the acceleration due to gravity, dy = - g = - 9.80 m/s2. The value of\ny when the motorcycle reaches the ground is y = - 50.0 m. The initial veloc-\nity is horizontal and is our unknown, Vxo; the initial vertical velocity is zero,\nVyo = 0.\n6.

So we first find the time using the y motion, and then\nuse this time value in the x equations.

Calculate\n(a) the maximum height, (b) the time of travel before the football hits the ground,\nand (c) how far away it hits the ground. Assume the ball leaves the foot at ground\nlevel, and ignore air resistance and rotation of the ball.\nAPPROACH This may seem difficult at first because there are so many questions.\nBut we can deal with them one at a time. We take the y direction as positive\nupward, and treat the x and y motions separately. The total time in the air is again\ndetermined by the y motion. The x motion occurs at constant velocity. The y com-\nponent of velocity varies, being positive (upward) initially, decreasing to zero at\nthe highest point, and then becoming negative as the football falls.\nSOLUTION We resolve the initial velocity into its components (Fig. 3-23):\nVxo = Vo cos 37.0° = (20.0m/s)(0.799) = 16.0 m/s\nVyo = Vo sin 37.0° = (20.0m/s)(0.602) = 12.0 m/s.\n(a) To find the maximum height, we consider a time interval that begins just after\nthe football loses contact with the foot until the ball reaches its maximum height.\nDuring this time interval, the acceleration is g downward. At the maximum\nheight, the velocity is horizontal (Fig. 3-23), so Vy = 0. This occurs at a time given\nby Vy = Vyo - gt with Vy = 0 (see Eq. 2-11a in Table 3-2), so Vyo = gt and\n(12.0m/s)\n= 1.224 s ~ 1.22 s.\nt = g = (9.80 m/s2)\nFrom Eq. 2-11b, with yo = 0, we can solve for y at this time (t = Vyo/g):\ny = Vyot - ¿ gt2 =\n0'0\n1 Vyo\n-\n=\n0'yo\ng\n2 g\n2g\n2(9.80 m/s2)\n= 7.35 m.\nThe maximum height is 7.35 m.

That is, the time to go up\nequals the time to come back down to the same level (ignoring air resistance).\n62 CHAPTER 3 Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors\n", 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': "-\nEXERCISE F In Example 3-6, what is (a) the velocity vector at the maximum height, and\n(b) the acceleration vector at maximum height?\nIn Example 3-6, we treated the football as if it were a particle, ignoring its\nrotation.

Suppose the football in Example 3-6 was punted,\nand left the punter's foot at a height of 1.00 m above the ground. How far did\nthe football travel before hitting the ground? Set x0 = 0, y0 = 0.\nAPPROACH The only difference here from Example 3-6 is that the football hits\nthe ground below its starting point of y0 = 0. That is, the ball hits the ground at\ny = - 1.00 m. See Fig. 3-26. Thus we cannot use the range formula which is valid\nonly if y (final) = yo . As in Example 3-6, 00 = 20.0 m/s, 00 = 37.0°.\nSOLUTION With y = - 1.00 m and Vyo = 12.0m/s (see Example 3-6), we use\nthe y version of Eq. 2-11b with dy = - g,\ny = yo + Uyot - 2gt2,\nand obtain\n-1.00m = 0 + (12.0m/s)t - (4.90 m/s2)t2.\nWe rearrange this equation into standard form (ax2 + bx + c = 0) so we can\nuse the quadratic formula:\n(4.90 m/s2) +2 - (12.0 m/s)t - (1.00 m) = 0.\nThe quadratic formula (Appendix A-4) gives\nt\n=\n2.53 s or -0.081 s.\n2(4.90 m/s2)\n12.0 m/s + V (-12.0 m/s)2 - 4(4.90 m/s2)(-1.00 m)\n=\nThe second solution would correspond to a time prior to the kick, so it doesn't\napply. With t = 2.53 s for the time at which the ball touches the ground, the\nhorizontal distance the ball traveled is (using Vx0 = 16.0 m/s from Example 3-6):\nX= Vxot = (16.0m/s)(2.53 s) = 40.5 m.\nOur assumption in Example 3-6 that the ball leaves the foot at ground level\nwould result in an underestimate of about 1.3 m in the distance our punt traveled.\nFIGURE 3-27 Examples of\nprojectile motion: a boy jumping,\nand glowing lava from the volcano\nStromboli.\n*3-7 Projectile Motion Is Parabolic\nWe now show that the path followed by any projectile is a parabola, if we can\nignore air resistance and can assume that g is constant. To do so, we need to find\ny as a function of x by eliminating t between the two equations for horizontal and\nvertical motion (Eq. 2-11b in Table 3-2), and for simplicity we set x0 = yo = 0:\nX = Vrot\ny = Vyot - ¿ gt2.\nFrom the first equation, we have t = x/Uxo, and we substitute this into the second\none to obtain\ny = (2010)x - (8)2.\n2020\n(3-6)\nWe see that y as a function of x has the form\ny = Ax - Bx2,\nwhere A and B are constants for any specific projectile motion. This is the standard\nequation for a parabola. See Figs. 3-17 and 3-27.\nThe idea that projectile motion is parabolic was, in Galileo's day, at the fore-\nfront of physics research. Today we discuss it in Chapter 3 of introductory physics!\n*Some Sections of this book, such as this one, may be considered optional at the discretion of the\ninstructor. See the Preface for more details.\n64 CHAPTER 3\n", 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': '3-8 Relative Velocity\nWe now consider how observations made in different frames of reference are\nrelated to each other. For example, consider two trains approaching one another,\neach with a speed of 80 km/h with respect to the Earth. Observers on the Earth\nbeside the train tracks will measure 80 km/h for the speed of each of the trains.\nObservers on either one of the trains (a different frame of reference) will mea-\nsure a speed of 160 km/h for the train approaching them.\nSimilarly, when one car traveling 90 km/h passes a second car traveling in\nthe same direction at 75 km/h, the first car has a speed relative to the second car\nof 90 km/h - 75 km/h = 15 km/h.\nWhen the velocities are along the same line, simple addition or subtraction is\nsufficient to obtain the relative velocity. But if they are not along the same line, we\nmust make use of vector addition. We emphasize, as mentioned in Section 2-1, that\nwhen specifying a velocity, it is important to specify what the reference frame is.\nWhen determining relative velocity, it is easy to make a mistake by adding\nor subtracting the wrong velocities. It is important, therefore, to draw a diagram\nand use a careful labeling process. Each velocity is labeled by two subscripts:\nthe first refers to the object, the second to the reference frame in which it has this\nvelocity. For example, suppose a boat heads directly across a river, as shown\nin Fig. 3-28. We let VBw be the velocity of the Boat with respect to the Water.\n(This is also what the boat\'s velocity would be relative to the shore if the\nwater were still.) Similarly, VBS is the velocity of the Boat with respect to the Shore,\nand vws is the velocity of the Water with respect to the Shore (this is the river\ncurrent). Note that VBw is what the boat\'s motor produces (against the water),\nwhereas VBS is equal to VBw plus the effect of the current, vws . Therefore, the\nvelocity of the boat relative to the shore is (see vector diagram, Fig. 3-28)\nVBS = VBW + Vws ·\n(3-7)\nBy writing the subscripts using this convention, we see that the inner subscripts\n(the two W\'s) on the right-hand side of Eq. 3-7 are the same; also, the outer\nsubscripts on the right of Eq. 3-7 (the B and the S) are the same as the two\nsubscripts for the sum vector on the left, VBS . By following this convention (first\nsubscript for the object, second for the reference frame), you can write down the\ncorrect equation relating velocities in different reference frames."\nEquation 3-7 is valid in general and can be extended to three or more\nvelocities. For example, if a fisherman on the boat walks with a velocity VFB rela-\ntive to the boat, his velocity relative to the shore is VFS = VFB + VBW + Vws . The\nequations involving relative velocity will be correct when adjacent inner subscripts\nare identical and when the outermost ones correspond exactly to the two on the\nvelocity on the left of the equation. But this works only with plus signs (on the\nright), not minus signs.\nIt is often useful to remember that for any two objects or reference frames,\nA and B, the velocity of A relative to B has the same magnitude, but opposite\ndirection, as the velocity of B relative to A:\nVBA =\n-VAB ·\n(3-8)\nFor example, if a train is traveling 100 km/h relative to the Earth in a certain\ndirection, objects on the Earth (such as trees) appear to an observer on the train\nto be traveling 100 km/h in the opposite direction.\n+We thus can see, for example, that the equation VBW = VBS + Vws is wrong: the inner subscripts are\nnot the same, and the outer ones on the right do not correspond to the subscripts on the left.\nRiver current\nvws\nN\n4\nW+++E\nS\nVBS\nVBW\nθ\nFIGURE 3-28 A boat heads north\ndirectly across a river which flows\nwest. Velocity vectors are shown as\ngreen arrows:\nVBS = velocity of Boat with\nrespect to the Shore,\nVBW = velocity of Boat with\nrespect to the Water,\nVws = velocity of Water with\nrespect to the Shore\n(river current).\nAs it crosses the river, the boat is\ndragged downstream by the current.\nSECTION 3-8 Relative Velocity 65\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'River current\nN\nW++E\nS\nVws\nVBS\nθ\nVRW\nFIGURE 3-29 Example 3-10.\nFIGURE 3-30 Example 3-11.\nA boat heading directly across a\nriver whose current moves at\n1.20 m/s.\nRiver current\nvws\nVBS\nB\nVBW\nθ\nSummary\nEXAMPLE 3-10\nHeading upstream. A boat\'s speed in still water is VBw =\n1.85 m/s. If the boat is to travel north directly across a river whose westward current has\nspeed vws = 1.20 m/s, at what upstream angle must the boat head? (See Fig. 3-29.)\nAPPROACH If the boat heads straight across the river, the current will drag\nthe boat downstream (westward). To overcome the river\'s current, the boat\nmust have an upstream (eastward) component of velocity as well as a cross-stream\n(northward) component. Figure 3-29 has been drawn with VBS, the velocity of\nthe Boat relative to the Shore, pointing directly across the river because this is\nwhere the boat is supposed to go. (Note that VBS = VBW + Vws ·)\nSOLUTION Vector VBw points upstream at angle 0 as shown. From the diagram,\nsin 0 = "NS =\nVBW\n1.85 m/s\n1.20 m/s\n= 0.6486.\nThus 0 = 40.4°, so the boat must head upstream at a 40.4° angle.\nEXAMPLE 3-11\nHeading across the river. The same boat (VBw = 1.85 m/s)\nnow heads directly across the river whose current is still 1.20 m/s. (a) What is the velocity\n(magnitude and direction) of the boat relative to the shore? (b) If the river is 110 m\nwide, how long will it take to cross and how far downstream will the boat be then?\nAPPROACH The boat now heads directly across the river and is pulled down-\nstream by the current, as shown in Fig. 3-30. The boat\'s velocity with respect to\nthe shore, VBS, is the sum of its velocity with respect to the water, VBw, plus the\nvelocity of the water with respect to the shore, vws : just as before,\nVBS = VBW + Vws ·\nSOLUTION (a) Since VBw is perpendicular to wws, we can get Ups using the\ntheorem of Pythagoras:\nUBS =\nVOBW + UWS = V (1.85 m/s)2 + (1.20 m/s)2 = 2.21 m/s.\nWe can obtain the angle (note how 0 is defined in Fig. 3-30) from:\ntan 0 = Vws/VBw= (1.20 m/s)/(1.85 m/s) = 0.6486.\nA calculator with a key INV TAN Or ARC TAN Or TAN 1 gives 0 = tan-1(0.6486)\n= 33.0°. Note that this angle is not equal to the angle calculated in Example 3-10.\n(b) The travel time for the boat is determined by the time it takes to cross the\nriver. Given the river\'s width D = 110 m, we can use the velocity component in the\ndirection of D, VBW = D/t. Solving for t, we get t = 110 m/1.85 m/s = 59.5 s.\nThe boat will have been carried downstream, in this time, a distance\nd = Vwst = (1.20 m/s)(59.5 s) = 71.4m ~ 71 m.\nNOTE There is no acceleration in this Example, so the motion involves only\nconstant velocities (of the boat or of the river).\nA quantity such as velocity, that has both a magnitude and a\ndirection, is called a vector. A quantity such as mass, that has\nonly a magnitude, is called a scalar. On diagrams, vectors are\nrepresented by arrows.\nAddition of vectors can be done graphically by placing the\ntail of each successive arrow at the tip of the previous one. The\nsum, or resultant vector, is the arrow drawn from the tail of the\nfirst vector to the tip of the last vector. Two vectors can also be\nadded using the parallelogram method.\nVectors can be added more accurately by adding their\ncomponents along chosen axes with the aid of trigonometric\nfunctions. A vector of magnitude V making an angle 0 with the\n+x axis has components\nVx = V cos 0,\nVy = V sin 0.\n(3-3)\nGiven the components, we can find a vector\'s magnitude and\ndirection from\nVy\nV = Vv? + Vý,\ntan 0 =\nVx\n(3-4)\n.\nProjectile motion is the motion of an object in the air near the\nEarth\'s surface under the effect of gravity alone. It can be analyzed\nas two separate motions if air resistance can be ignored. The hori-\nzontal component of motion is at constant velocity, whereas the\nvertical component is at constant acceleration, g, just as for an\nobject falling vertically under the action of gravity.\nThe velocity of an object relative to one frame of refer-\nence can be found by vector addition if its velocity relative to a\nsecond frame of reference, and the relative velocity of the two\nreference frames, are known.\n66 CHAPTER 3 Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Questions\n1.

Now we deal with the question of why objects move as\nthey do: What makes an object at rest begin to move? What causes\nan object to accelerate or decelerate? What is involved when an object moves\nin a curved path? We can answer in each case that a force is required. In this\nChapter*, we will investigate the connection between force and motion, which is\nthe subject called dynamics.\n4-1 Force\nFIGURE 4-1 A force exerted on a\ngrocery cart-in this case exerted by\na person.\nIntuitively, we experience force as any kind of a push or a pull on an object. When\nyou push a stalled car or a grocery cart (Fig. 4-1), you are exerting a force on it.\nWhen a motor lifts an elevator, or a hammer hits a nail, or the wind blows the\nleaves of a tree, a force is being exerted. We often call these contact forces because\nthe force is exerted when one object comes in contact with another object. On\nthe other hand, we say that an object falls because of the force of gravity (which is\nnot a contact force).\nIf an object is at rest, to start it moving requires force-that is, a force is\nneeded to accelerate an object from zero velocity to a nonzero velocity. For an\nobject already moving, if you want to change its velocity-either in direction or in\nmagnitude-a force is required. In other words, to accelerate an object, a force\nis always required. In Section 4-4 we discuss the precise relation between accel-\neration and net force, which is Newton's second law.\nOne way to measure the magnitude (or strength) of a force is to use a spring\nscale (Fig. 4-2). Normally, such a spring scale is used to find the weight of an\nobject; by weight we mean the force of gravity acting on the object (Section 4-6).\nThe spring scale, once calibrated, can be used to measure other kinds of forces\nas well, such as the pulling force shown in Fig. 4-2.\nA force exerted in a different direction has a different effect. Force has direc-\ntion as well as magnitude, and is indeed a vector that follows the rules of vector\naddition discussed in Chapter 3. We can represent any force on a diagram by an\narrow, just as we did with velocity. The direction of the arrow is the direction of the\npush or pull, and its length is drawn proportional to the magnitude of the force.\nOlive\noil\nFIGURE 4-2 A spring scale\nused to measure a force.\nOlive\noil\nOlive\nLOW\n0 1 2 34567 8910\n4-2 Newton's First Law of Motion\nWhat is the relationship between force and motion? Aristotle (384-322 B.C.)\nbelieved that a force was required to keep an object moving along a horizontal\nplane. To Aristotle, the natural state of an object was at rest, and a force was\nbelieved necessary to keep an object in motion. Furthermore, Aristotle argued,\nthe greater the force on the object, the greater its speed.\nSome 2000 years later, Galileo disagreed: he maintained that it is just as natural\nfor an object to be in motion with a constant velocity as it is for it to be at rest.\n*We treat everyday objects in motion here. When velocities are extremely high, close to the speed of\nlight (3.0 × 108 m/s), we use the theory of relativity (Chapter 26), and in the submicroscopic world\nof atoms and molecules we use quantum theory (Chapter 27 ff).\n76 CHAPTER 4 Dynamics: Newton's Laws of Motion\n", 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 29, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'To understand Galileo\'s idea, consider the following observations involving\nmotion along a horizontal plane. To push an object with a rough surface along a\ntabletop at constant speed requires a certain amount of force. To push an equally\nheavy object with a very smooth surface across the table at the same speed will\nrequire less force. If a layer of oil or other lubricant is placed between the surface\nof the object and the table, then almost no force is required to keep the object\nmoving. Notice that in each successive step, less force is required. As the next\nstep, we imagine there is no friction at all, that the object does not rub against the\ntable-or there is a perfect lubricant between the object and the table-and\ntheorize that once started, the object would move across the table at constant\nspeed with no force applied. A steel ball bearing rolling on a hard horizontal\nsurface approaches this situation. So does a puck on an air table, in which a thin\nlayer of air reduces friction almost to zero.\nIt was Galileo\'s genius to imagine such an idealized world-in this case, one\nwhere there is no friction-and to see that it could lead to a more accurate and\nricher understanding of the real world. This idealization led him to his remark-\nable conclusion that if no force is applied to a moving object, it will continue to\nmove with constant speed in a straight line. An object slows down only if a force\nis exerted on it. Galileo thus interpreted friction as a force akin to ordinary pushes\nand pulls.\nB\nPHYSICS\nTo push an object across a table at constant speed requires a force from your\nhand that can balance the force of friction (Fig. 4-3). When the object moves at\nconstant speed, your pushing force is equal in magnitude to the friction force; but\nthese two forces are in opposite directions, so the net force on the object (the vector\nsum of the two forces) is zero. This is consistent with Galileo\'s viewpoint, for the\nobject moves with constant velocity when no net force is exerted on it.\nUpon this foundation laid by Galileo, Isaac Newton (Fig. 4-4) built his great\ntheory of motion. Newton\'s analysis of motion is summarized in his famous\n"three laws of motion." In his great work, the Principia (published in 1687),\nNewton readily acknowledged his debt to Galileo. In fact, Newton\'s first law\nof motion is close to Galileo\'s conclusions. It states that\nEvery object continues in its state of rest, or of uniform velocity in a straight\nline, as long as no net force acts on it.\nThe tendency of an object to maintain its state of rest or of uniform velocity in a\nstraight line is called inertia. As a result, Newton\'s first law is often called the\nlaw of inertia.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 4-1\nNewton\'s first law. A school bus comes\nto a sudden stop, and all of the backpacks on the floor start to slide forward.\nWhat force causes them to do that?\nRESPONSE It isn\'t "force" that does it. By Newton\'s first law, the backpacks\ncontinue their state of motion, maintaining their velocity. The backpacks slow\ndown if a force is applied, such as friction with the floor.\nGIANCOI\nDOUGLAS C.\nFfr\nFIGURE 4-3 F represents the force\napplied by the person and Ffr\nrepresents the force of friction.\nNEWTON\'S FIRST LAW\nOF MOTION\nFIGURE 4-4\nIsaac Newton (1642-1727). Besides\ndeveloping mechanics, including his\nthree great laws of motion and the law\nof universal gravitation, he also tried\nto understand the nature of light.\nInertial Reference Frames\nNewton\'s first law does not hold in every reference frame. For example, if your\nreference frame is an accelerating car, an object such as a cup resting on the\ndashboard may begin to move toward you (it stayed at rest as long as the car\'s\nvelocity remained constant). The cup accelerated toward you, but neither you nor\nanything else exerted a force on it in that direction. Similarly, in the reference frame\nof the decelerating bus in Example 4-1, there was no force pushing the backpacks\nforward. In accelerating reference frames, Newton\'s first law does not hold. Physics\nis easier in reference frames in which Newton\'s first law does hold, and they\nare called inertial reference frames (the law of inertia is valid in them). For most\npurposes, we usually make the approximation that a reference frame fixed on the\nEarth is an inertial frame. This is not precisely true, due to the Earth\'s rotation,\nbut usually it is close enough.\nSECTION 4-2 Newton\'s First Law of Motion\n77\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 30, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CAUTION\nDistinguish mass from weight\nFIGURE 4-5 The bobsled\naccelerates because the team exerts\na force.\nAny reference frame that moves with constant velocity (say, a car or an air-\nplane) relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial reference frame. Reference\nframes where the law of inertia does not hold, such as the accelerating reference\nframes discussed above, are called noninertial reference frames. How can we be\nsure a reference frame is inertial or not? By checking to see if Newton\'s first law\nholds. Thus Newton\'s first law serves as the definition of inertial reference frames.\n4-3 Mass\nNewton\'s second law, which we come to in the next Section, makes use of the\nconcept of mass. Newton used the term mass as a synonym for "quantity of matter."\nThis intuitive notion of the mass of an object is not very precise because the\nconcept "quantity of matter" is not very well defined. More precisely, we can say\nthat mass is a measure of the inertia of an object. The more mass an object has,\nthe greater the force needed to give it a particular acceleration. It is harder to start\nit moving from rest, or to stop it when it is moving, or to change its velocity sideways\nout of a straight-line path. A truck has much more inertia than a baseball moving\nat the same speed, and a much greater force is needed to change the truck\'s\nvelocity at the same rate as the ball\'s. The truck therefore has much more mass.\nTo quantify the concept of mass, we must define a standard. In SI units, the\nunit of mass is the kilogram (kg) as we discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1-5.\nThe terms mass and weight are often confused with one another, but it is\nimportant to distinguish between them. Mass is a property of an object itself\n(a measure of an object\'s inertia, or its "quantity of matter"). Weight, on the other\nhand, is a force, the pull of gravity acting on an object. To see the difference,\nsuppose we take an object to the Moon. The object will weigh only about one-sixth\nas much as it did on Earth, since the force of gravity is weaker. But its mass will\nbe the same. It will have the same amount of matter as on Earth, and will have\njust as much inertia-in the absence of friction, it will be just as hard to start it\nmoving on the Moon as on Earth, or to stop it once it is moving. (More on weight\nin Section 4-6.)\n4-4 Newton\'s Second Law of Motion\nNewton\'s first law states that if no net force is acting on an object at rest, the\nobject remains at rest; or if the object is moving, it continues moving with constant\nspeed in a straight line. But what happens if a net force is exerted on an object?\nNewton perceived that the object\'s velocity will change (Fig. 4-5). A net force\nexerted on an object may make its velocity increase. Or, if the net force is in a\ndirection opposite to the motion, that force will reduce the object\'s velocity. If the\nnet force acts sideways on a moving object, the direction of the object\'s velocity\nchanges. That change in the direction of the velocity is also an acceleration. So a\nsideways net force on an object also causes acceleration. In general, we can say\nthat a net force causes acceleration.\nWhat precisely is the relationship between acceleration and force? Everyday\nexperience can suggest an answer. Consider the force required to push a cart\nwhen friction is small enough to ignore. (If there is friction, consider the net\nforce, which is the force you exert minus the force of friction.) If you push the\ncart horizontally with a gentle but constant force for a certain period of time,\nyou will make the cart accelerate from rest up to some speed, say 3 km/h. If you\npush with twice the force, the cart will reach 3 km/h in half the time. The accel-\neration will be twice as great. If you triple the force, the acceleration is tripled,\nand so on. Thus, the acceleration of an object is directly proportionalt to the net\napplied force. But the acceleration depends on the mass of the object as well.\nIf you push an empty grocery cart with the same force as you push one that\nis filled with groceries, you will find that the full cart accelerates more slowly.\n+A review of proportionality is given in Appendix A.\n78 CHAPTER 4 Dynamics: Newton\'s Laws of Motion\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 31, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The greater the mass, the less the acceleration for the same net force. The mathe-\nmatical relation, as Newton argued, is that the acceleration of an object is inversely\nproportional to its mass. These relationships are found to hold in general and can\nbe summarized as follows:\nThe acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting\non it, and is inversely proportional to the object\'s mass. The direction of the\nacceleration is in the direction of the net force acting on the object.\nThis is Newton\'s second law of motion.\nNewton\'s second law can be written as an equation:\nã = =\nm\nwhere a stands for acceleration, m for the mass, and EF for the net force on the\nobject. The symbol 2 (Greek "sigma") stands for "sum of"; F stands for force,\nso EF means the vector sum of all forces acting on the object, which we define as\nthe net force.\nΣΕ\n,\nWe rearrange this equation to obtain the familiar statement of Newton\'s\nsecond law:\n¿F = ma.\n(4-1)\nNewton\'s second law relates the description of motion to the cause of motion,\nforce. It is one of the most fundamental relationships in physics. From Newton\'s\nsecond law we can make a more precise definition of force as an action capable\nof accelerating an object.\nEvery force F is a vector, with magnitude and direction. Equation 4-1 is\na vector equation valid in any inertial reference frame. It can be written in\ncomponent form in rectangular coordinates as\nΣFx = max,\n≥Fy = may,\n≥Fz = maz.\nIf the motion is all along a line (one-dimensional), we can leave out the sub-\nscripts and simply write >F = ma. Again, a is the acceleration of an object of\nmass m, and EF includes all the forces acting on that object, and only forces\nacting on that object. (Sometimes the net force EF is written as Fnet , SO Fnet = ma.)\nIn SI units, with the mass in kilograms, the unit of force is called the newton (N).\nOne newton is the force required to impart an acceleration of 1 m/s2 to a\nmass of 1 kg. Thus 1 N = 1 kg .m/s2.\nIn cgs units, the unit of mass is the gram+ (g). The unit of force is the dyne, which\nis defined as the net force needed to impart an acceleration of 1 cm/s2 to a mass\nof 1 g. Thus 1 dyne = 1 g .cm/s2. Because 1 g = 10-3 kg and 1 cm = 10-2m, then\n1 dyne = 10-5 N.\nIn the British system, which we rarely use, the unit of force is the pound\n(abbreviated lb), where 1 lb = 4.44822 N ~ 4.45 N. The unit of mass is the slug,\nwhich is defined as that mass which will undergo an acceleration of 1 ft/s2 when\na force of 1 lb is applied to it. Thus 1 lb = 1 slug . ft/s2. Table 4-1 summarizes the\nunits in the different systems.\nIt is very important that only one set of units be used in a given calculation\nor Problem, with the SI being what we almost always use. If the force is given in,\nsay, newtons, and the mass in grams, then before attempting to solve for the\nacceleration in SI units, we must change the mass to kilograms. For example, if the\nforce is given as 2.0 N along the x axis and the mass is 500 g, we change the latter\nto 0.50 kg, and the acceleration will then automatically come out in m/s2 when\nNewton\'s second law is used:\nΣΕx\n2.0N\n2.0 kg · m/s2\n= 4.0 m/s2,\nax = = =\n0.50 kg\n0.50 kg\nwhere we set 1 N = 1 kg ·m/s2.\n*Be careful not to confuse g for gram with g for the acceleration due to gravity.

From your inertial frame, Newton\'s laws are valid. What force pushes\nthe cup off the dashboard?\n80 CHAPTER 4 Dynamics: Newton\'s Laws of Motion\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 33, 'type': 'text', 'content': '4-5 Newton\'s Third Law of Motion\nNewton\'s second law of motion describes quantitatively how forces affect motion.\nBut where, we may ask, do forces come from? Observations suggest that a force\nexerted on any object is always exerted by another object. A horse pulls a wagon,\na person pushes a grocery cart, a hammer pushes on a nail, a magnet attracts a\npaper clip. In each of these examples, a force is exerted on one object, and that\nforce is exerted by another object. For example, the force exerted on the nail is\nexerted by the hammer.\nBut Newton realized that things are not so one-sided. True, the hammer exerts\na force on the nail (Fig. 4-7). But the nail evidently exerts a force back on the\nhammer as well, for the hammer\'s speed is rapidly reduced to zero upon contact.\nOnly a strong force could cause such a rapid deceleration of the hammer. Thus,\nsaid Newton, the two objects must be treated on an equal basis. The hammer\nexerts a force on the nail, and the nail exerts a force back on the hammer. This\nis the essence of Newton\'s third law of motion:\nWhenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object\nexerts an equal force in the opposite direction on the first.\nThis law is sometimes paraphrased as "to every action there is an equal and oppo-\nsite reaction." This is perfectly valid. But to avoid confusion, it is very important\nto remember that the "action" force and the "reaction" force are acting on different\nobjects.\nAs evidence for the validity of Newton\'s third law, look at your hand when\nyou push against the edge of a desk, Fig. 4-8. Your hand\'s shape is distorted, clear\nevidence that a force is being exerted on it. You can see the edge of the desk press-\ning into your hand. You can even feel the desk exerting a force on your hand;\nit hurts! The harder you push against the desk, the harder the desk pushes back\non your hand. (You only feel forces exerted on you; when you exert a force on\nanother object, what you feel is that object pushing back on you.)\nForce exerted\non hand\nby desk\nFIGURE 4-8 If your hand pushes\nagainst the edge of a desk (the force\nvector is shown in red), the desk\npushes back against your hand (this\nforce vector is shown in a different\ncolor, violet, to remind us that this\nforce acts on a different object).\nForce exerted\non desk by hand\nThe force the desk exerts on your hand has the same magnitude as the force\nyour hand exerts on the desk. This is true not only if the desk is at rest but is true\neven if the desk is accelerating due to the force your hand exerts.\nAs another demonstration of Newton\'s third law, consider the ice skater in\nFig. 4-9. There is very little friction between her skates and the ice, so she will\nmove freely if a force is exerted on her. She pushes against the wall; and then she\nstarts moving backward. The force she exerts on the wall cannot make her start\nmoving, because that force acts on the wall. Something had to exert a force on her\nto start her moving, and that force could only have been exerted by the wall.\nThe force with which the wall pushes on her is, by Newton\'s third law, equal and\nopposite to the force she exerts on the wall.\nWhen a person throws a package out of a small boat (initially at rest), the\nboat starts moving in the opposite direction. The person exerts a force on the\npackage. The package exerts an equal and opposite force back on the person,\nand this force propels the person (and the boat) backward slightly.\nFIGURE 4-7 A hammer striking a\nnail. The hammer exerts a force on the\nnail and the nail exerts a force back on\nthe hammer. The latter force decelerates\nthe hammer and brings it to rest.\nNEWTON\'S THIRD LAW\nOF MOTION\nCAUTION\nAction and reaction forces act\non different objects\nFIGURE 4-9 An example of\nNewton\'s third law: when an ice\nskater pushes against the wall, the\nwall pushes back and this force\ncauses her to accelerate away.\nForce Force\non\non\nskater\nwall\nSECTION 4-5 Newton\'s Third Law of Motion 81\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 34, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Rocket propulsion also is explained using Newton's third law (Fig. 4-10).\nA common misconception is that rockets accelerate because the gases rushing\nout the back of the engine push against the ground or the atmosphere. Not true.\nWhat happens, instead, is that a rocket exerts a strong force on the gases, expel-\nling them; and the gases exert an equal and opposite force on the rocket. It is this\nlatter force that propels the rocket forward-the force exerted on the rocket by the\ngases (see Chapter-Opening Photo, page 75). Thus, a space vehicle is maneuvered\nin empty space by firing its rockets in the direction opposite to that in which it\nneeds to accelerate. When the rocket pushes on the gases in one direction, the\ngases push back on the rocket in the opposite direction. Jet aircraft too accelerate\nbecause the gases they thrust out backwards exert a forward force on the engines\n(Newton's third law).\n1\nFIGURE 4-10 Another example of\nNewton's third law: the launch of a\nrocket. The rocket engine pushes the\ngases downward, and the gases exert\nan equal and opposite force upward\non the rocket, accelerating it upward.\n(A rocket does not accelerate as a\nresult of its expelled gases pushing\nagainst the ground.)\nFIGURE 4-11 We can walk forward\nbecause, when one foot pushes\nbackward against the ground, the\nground pushes forward on that foot\n(Newton's third law). The two forces\nshown act on different objects.\nPHYSICS\nHorizontal\nforce exerted\non the ground\nby person's\nfoot\nHorizontal\nforce exerted\non the\nperson's foot\nby the ground\nConsider how we walk. A person begins walking by pushing with the foot\nbackward against the ground. The ground then exerts an equal and opposite\nforce forward on the person (Fig. 4-11), and it is this force, on the person, that\nmoves the person forward. (If you doubt this, try walking normally where there\nis no friction, such as on very smooth slippery ice.) In a similar way, a bird flies\nforward by exerting a backward force on the air, but it is the air pushing\nforward (Newton's third law) on the bird's wings that propels the bird forward.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 4-4\nWhat makes a car go forward?\nWhat exerts the force to move a car?\nRESPONSE A common answer is that the engine makes the car move for-\nward. But it is not so simple. The engine makes the wheels go around. But if the\ntires are on slick ice or wet mud, they just spin. Friction is needed. On firm\nground, the tires push backward against the ground because of friction. By\nNewton's third law, the ground pushes on the tires in the opposite direction,\naccelerating the car forward.\nWe tend to associate forces with active objects such as humans, animals,\nengines, or a moving object like a hammer. It is often difficult to see how an\ninanimate object at rest, such as a wall or a desk, or the wall of an ice rink\n(Fig. 4-9), can exert a force. The explanation is that every material, no matter\nhow hard, is elastic (springy) at least to some degree. A stretched rubber band\ncan exert a force on a wad of paper and accelerate it to fly across the room.\nOther materials may not stretch as readily as rubber, but they do stretch or\ncompress when a force is applied to them. And just as a stretched rubber band\nexerts a force, so does a stretched (or compressed) wall, desk, or car fender.\nFrom the examples discussed above, we can see how important it is to\nremember on what object a given force is exerted and by what object that force\nis exerted. A force influences the motion of an object only when it is applied on\nthat object. A force exerted by an object does not influence that same object; it\nonly influences the other object on which it is exerted. Thus, to avoid confusion,\nthe two prepositions on and by must always be used-and used with care.\nFGP\nFPG\nNEWTON'S THIRD LAW\nOF MOTION\nOne way to keep clear which force acts on which object is to use double sub-\nscripts. For example, the force exerted on the Person by the Ground as the person\nwalks in Fig. 4-11 can be labeled FpG. And the force exerted on the ground by\nthe person is FGp . By Newton's third law\nFGP = - FPG·\n(4-2)\nFGp and FpG have the same magnitude (Newton's third law), and the minus sign\nreminds us that these two forces are in opposite directions.\nNote carefully that the two forces shown in Fig. 4-11 act on different\nobjects-to emphasize this we used slightly different colors for the vector arrows\nrepresenting these forces. These two forces would never appear together in a\nsum of forces in Newton's second law, EF = ma. Why not? Because they act on\ndifferent objects: a is the acceleration of one particular object, and EF must\ninclude only the forces on that one object.\n82 CHAPTER 4 Dynamics: Newton's Laws of Motion\n", 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 35, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Force on sled\nexerted by\nexerted\nby sled\nassistant\nForce on\nassistant\nESA\n(= - FAS)\nB\n"AS\nFSG\nFGS (= - FSG)\nF GA\nFAG\nFriction\nForce on\nForce on\nForce on\nforce on\nground\nground\nassistant\nsled exerted\nexerted\nexerted\nexerted\nby ground\nby sled\nby assistant\nby ground\n(= - FAG)\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 4-5\nThird law clarification. Michelangelo\'s\nassistant has been assigned the task of moving a block of marble using a sled\n(Fig. 4-12).

No matter how hard I pull, the backward reaction force always equals\nmy forward force, so the net force must be zero. I\'ll never be able to move this\nload." Is he correct?\nRESPONSE No. Although it is true that the action and reaction forces are equal\nin magnitude, the assistant has forgotten that they are exerted on different\nobjects. The forward ("action") force is exerted by the assistant on the sled\n(Fig. 4-12), whereas the backward "reaction" force is exerted by the sled on the\nassistant. To determine if the assistant moves or not, we must consider only\nthe forces on the assistant and then apply EF = ma, where EF is the net force\non the assistant, a is the acceleration of the assistant, and m is the assistant\'s mass.\nThere are two forces on the assistant that affect his forward motion; they are\nshown as bright red (magenta) arrows in Figs. 4-12 and 4-13: they are (1) the hori-\nzontal force FAG exerted on the assistant by the ground (the harder he pushes\nbackward against the ground, the harder the ground pushes forward on him-\nNewton\'s third law), and (2) the force FAS exerted on the assistant by the sled,\npulling backward on him; see Fig. 4-13. If he pushes hard enough on the ground,\nthe force on him exerted by the ground, FAG, will be larger than the sled pulling\nback, FAS, and the assistant accelerates forward (Newton\'s second law). The sled,\non the other hand, accelerates forward when the force on it exerted by the assis-\ntant is greater than the frictional force exerted backward on it by the ground (that\nis, when FSA has greater magnitude than FsG in Fig. 4-12).\nUsing double subscripts to clarify Newton\'s third law can become cumbersome,\nand we won\'t usually use them in this way. We will usually use a single subscript\nreferring to what exerts the force on the object being discussed. Nevertheless,\nif there is any confusion in your mind about a given force, go ahead and use two\nsubscripts to identify on what object and by what object the force is exerted.\nEXERCISE B Return to the first Chapter-Opening Question, page 75, and answer it\nagain now.

Therefore the\ndownward force of gravity (FG) on\nan object at rest must be balanced\nby an upward force (the normal\nforce FN) exerted by the table in this\ncase. (b) FN is the force exerted on\nthe table by the statue and is the\nreaction force to FN by Newton\'s\nthird law. (FN is shown in a different\ncolor to remind us it acts on a\ndifferent object.) The reaction force\nto FG is not shown.\nCAUTION\nWeight and normal force are not\naction-reaction pairs\n4-6 Weight-the Force of Gravity;\nand the Normal Force\nAs we saw in Chapter 2, Galileo claimed that all objects dropped near the surface\nof the Earth would fall with the same acceleration, g, if air resistance was negligible.\nThe force that causes this acceleration is called the force of gravity or gravitational\nforce. What exerts the gravitational force on an object? It is the Earth, as we will\ndiscuss in Chapter 5, and the force acts vertically* downward, toward the center of\nthe Earth. Let us apply Newton\'s second law to an object of mass m falling freely\ndue to gravity. For the acceleration, a, we use the downward acceleration due to\ngravity, g. Thus, the gravitational force on an object, FG, can be written as\nFG = mg.\n(4-3)\nThe direction of this force is down toward the center of the Earth. The magnitude\nof the force of gravity on an object, mg, is commonly called the object\'s weight.\nIn SI units, g = 9.80 m/s2 = 9.80 N/kg, so the weight of a 1.00-kg mass on\nEarth is 1.00 kg × 9.80 m/s2 = 9.80 N. We will mainly be concerned with the\nweight of objects on Earth, but we note that on the Moon, on other planets, or in\nspace, the weight of a given mass will be different than it is on Earth. For exam-\nple, on the Moon the acceleration due to gravity is about one-sixth what it is on\nEarth, and a 1.0-kg mass weighs only 1.6 N. Although we will not use British\nunits, we note that for practical purposes on the Earth, a mass of 1.0 kg weighs\nabout 2.2 lb. (On the Moon, 1 kg weighs only about 0.4 lb.)\nThe force of gravity acts on an object when it is falling. When an object is at\nrest on the Earth, the gravitational force on it does not disappear, as we know if\nwe weigh it on a spring scale. The same force, given by Eq. 4-3, continues to act.\nWhy, then, doesn\'t the object move? From Newton\'s second law, the net force\non an object that remains at rest is zero. There must be another force on the\nobject to balance the gravitational force. For an object resting on a table, the table\nexerts this upward force; see Fig. 4-14a. The table is compressed slightly beneath\nthe object, and due to its elasticity, it pushes up on the object as shown. The force\nexerted by the table is often called a contact force, since it occurs when two objects\nare in contact. (The force of your hand pushing on a cart is also a contact force.)\nWhen a contact force acts perpendicular to the common surface of contact, it\nis referred to as the normal force ("normal" means perpendicular); hence it is\nlabeled FN in Fig. 4-14a.\nThe two forces shown in Fig. 4-14a are both acting on the statue, which\nremains at rest, so the vector sum of these two forces must be zero (Newton\'s second\nlaw). Hence FG and FN must be of equal magnitude and in opposite directions.\nBut they are not the equal and opposite forces spoken of in Newton\'s third law. The\naction and reaction forces of Newton\'s third law act on different objects, whereas the\ntwo forces shown in Fig. 4-14a act on the same object. For each of the forces shown\nin Fig. 4-14a, we can ask, "What is the reaction force?" The upward force FN\non the statue is exerted by the table. The reaction to this force is a force exerted by\nthe statue downward on the table. It is shown in Fig. 4-14b, where it is labeled Fy .\nThis force, Fy, exerted on the table by the statue, is the reaction force to Fy in\naccord with Newton\'s third law. What about the other force on the statue, the force\nof gravity FG exerted by the Earth? Can you guess what the reaction is to this\nforce? We will see in Chapter 5 that the reaction force is also a gravitational force,\nexerted on the Earth by the statue.\nEXERCISE E Return to the second Chapter-Opening Question, page 75, and answer it\nagain now. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\n*The concept of "vertical" is tied to gravity. The best definition of vertical is that it is the direction in\nwhich objects fall. A surface that is "horizontal," on the other hand, is a surface on which a round\nobject won\'t start rolling: gravity has no effect. Horizontal is perpendicular to vertical.\n*Since 1N = 1 kg ·m/s2 (Section 4-4), then 1 m/s2 = 1 N/kg.\n84 CHAPTER 4 Dynamics: Newton\'s Laws of Motion\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 37, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 4-6\nWeight, normal force, and a box. A friend has given you\na special gift, a box of mass 10.0 kg with a mystery surprise inside. The box is\nresting on the smooth (frictionless) horizontal surface of a table (Fig. 4-15a).\n(a) Determine the weight of the box and the normal force exerted on it by\nthe table. (b) Now your friend pushes down on the box with a force of 40.0 N,\nas in Fig. 4-15b. Again determine the normal force exerted on the box by\nthe table. (c) If your friend pulls upward on the box with a force of 40.0 N\n(Fig. 4-15c), what now is the normal force exerted on the box by the table?\nAPPROACH The box is at rest on the table, so the net force on the box in each\ncase is zero (Newton's first or second law). The weight of the box has magni-\ntude mg in all three cases.\nSOLUTION (a) The weight of the box is mg = (10.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 98.0 N,\nand this force acts downward. The only other force on the box is the normal\nforce exerted upward on it by the table, as shown in Fig. 4-15a. We chose the\nupward direction as the positive y direction; then the net force 2Fy on the box\nis >Fy = FN - mg; the minus sign means mg acts in the negative y direction\n(m and g are magnitudes). The box is at rest, so the net force on it must be\nzero (Newton's second law, EFy = may, and ay = 0). Thus\n≥Fy = may\nFN - mg = 0,\nso we have\nFN = mg.\nThe normal force on the box, exerted by the table, is 98.0 N upward, and has\nmagnitude equal to the box's weight.\n(b) Your friend is pushing down on the box with a force of 40.0 N. So instead\nof only two forces acting on the box, now there are three forces acting on the\nbox, as shown in Fig. 4-15b. The weight of the box is still mg = 98.0 N. The net\nforce is ≥Fy = FN - mg - 40.0 N, and is equal to zero because the box remains\nat rest (a = 0). Newton's second law gives\n≥Fy = FN - mg - 40.0N = 0.\nWe solve this equation for the normal force:\nFN= mg + 40.0N = 98.0N + 40.0N = 138.0N,\nwhich is greater than in (a). The table pushes back with more force when a person\npushes down on the box. The normal force is not always equal to the weight!\n(c) The box's weight is still 98.0 N and acts downward. The force exerted by\nyour friend and the normal force both act upward (positive direction), as shown\nin Fig. 4-15c. The box doesn't move since your friend's upward force is less\nthan the weight. The net force, again set to zero in Newton's second law because\na = 0, is\n≥Fy = FN - mg + 40.0N = 0,\nSO\nFN = mg - 40.0N = 98.0N - 40.0N = 58.0N.\nThe table does not push against the full weight of the box because of the upward\nforce exerted by your friend.\nNOTE The weight of the box (= mg) does not change as a result of your friend's\npush or pull. Only the normal force is affected.\nRecall that the normal force is elastic in origin (the table in Fig. 4-15 sags\nslightly under the weight of the box). The normal force in Example 4-6 is verti-\ncal, perpendicular to the horizontal table. The normal force is not always vertical,\nhowever. When you push against a wall, for example, the normal force with\nwhich the wall pushes back on you is horizontal (Fig. 4-9). For an object on a\nplane inclined at an angle to the horizontal, such as a skier or car on a hill, the\nnormal force acts perpendicular to the plane and so is not vertical.\nEN\ny\nB\n(a) ≥Fy = FN - mg = 0\nÉN\ny\n40.0 N\nmỹ\n(b) ≥Fy = FN - mg - 40.0N=0\n40.0N\ny\nEN\nmg\n(c) ≥Fy= FN-mg +40.0N=0\nFIGURE 4-15 Example 4-6.\n(a) A 10-kg gift box is at rest on a\ntable.

What happens when a person pulls\nupward on the box in Example 4-6c with a force equal to, or greater than,\nthe box\'s weight? For example, let Fp = 100.0 N (Fig. 4-16) rather than the\n40.0 N shown in Fig. 4-15c.\nAPPROACH We can start just as in Example 4-6, but be ready for a surprise.\nSOLUTION The net force on the box is\nB\na\n≥Fy = FN - mg + Fp\n= FN - 98.0N + 100.0 N,\nmg (98.0 N)\nFIGURE 4-16 Example 4-7. The\nbox accelerates upward because\nFp > mg.\nand if we set this equal to zero (thinking the acceleration might be zero), we\nwould get FN = - 2.0N. This is nonsense, since the negative sign implies FN\npoints downward, and the table surely cannot pull down on the box (unless\nthere\'s glue on the table). The least FN can be is zero, which it will be in this case.\nWhat really happens here is that the box accelerates upward (a ¥ 0) because\nthe net force is not zero. The net force (setting the normal force FN = 0) is\n≥Fy = Fp - mg = 100.0N - 98.0N\n= 2.0N\nupward. See Fig. 4-16.

The direction of the acceleration is downward, so\nwe choose the positive direction as down (this is the opposite choice from\nExamples 4-6 and 4-7).\nSOLUTION (a) From Newton\'s second law,\nΣF = ma\nmg - FN = m(0.20g).\nB\nmg\nWe solve for FN :\nEN\nFN = mg - 0.20mg\n= 0.80mg,\nand it acts upward. The normal force FN is the force the scale exerts on the\nperson, and is equal and opposite to the force she exerts on the scale:\nFN = 0.80mg downward. Her weight (force of gravity on her) is still\nmg = (65 kg)(9.8m/s2) = 640 N. But the scale, needing to exert a force of\nonly 0.80mg, will give a reading of 0.80m = 52kg.\n(b) Now there is no acceleration, a = 0, so by Newton\'s second law,\nmg - FN = 0 and FN = mg. The scale reads her true mass of 65 kg.\nNOTE The scale in (a) gives a reading of 52 kg (as an "apparent mass"), but\nher mass doesn\'t change as a result of the acceleration: it stays at 65 kg.\n86 CHAPTER 4 Dynamics: Newton\'s Laws of Motion\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 39, 'type': 'text', 'content': "4-7 Solving Problems with Newton's Laws:\nFree-Body Diagrams\nNewton's second law tells us that the acceleration of an object is proportional to\nthe net force acting on the object. The net force, as mentioned earlier, is the\nvector sum of all forces acting on the object. Indeed, extensive experiments have\nshown that forces do add together as vectors precisely according to the rules\nwe developed in Chapter 3. For example, in Fig. 4-18, two forces of equal magni-\ntude (100 N each) are shown acting on an object at right angles to each other.\nIntuitively, we can see that the object will start moving at a 45° angle and thus\nthe net force acts at a 45° angle. This is just what the rules of vector addition\ngive. From the theorem of Pythagoras, the magnitude of the resultant force is\nFR = V (100 N)2 + (100 N)2 = 141 N.\nEXAMPLE 4-9\nAdding force vectors. Calculate the sum of the two forces\nexerted on the boat by workers A and B in Fig. 4-19a.\nAPPROACH We add force vectors like any other vectors as described in\nChapter 3. The first step is to choose an xy coordinate system (see Fig. 4-19a),\nand then resolve vectors into their components.\nSOLUTION The two force vectors are shown resolved into components in\nFig. 4-19b. We add the forces using the method of components. The compo-\nnents of FA are\nFAX = FA COS 45.0° = (40.0 N)(0.707) = 28.3 N,\nFAy = FA sin 45.0° = (40.0N)(0.707) = 28.3 N.\nThe components of FB are\nFBx= +FB cos 37.0° = +(30.0N)(0.799) = +24.0 N,\nFBy = - FB sin 37.0° = - (30.0N)(0.602) = - 18.1 N.\nFBy is negative because it points along the negative y axis. The components of\nthe resultant force are (see Fig. 4-19c)\nFRx = FAX + FBx = 28.3 N + 24.0N = 52.3 N,\nFRy = FAy + FBy = 28.3 N - 18.1N = 10.2 N.\nTo find the magnitude of the resultant force, we use the Pythagorean theorem,\nFR= VFRx + FRy = \\(52.3)2 + (10.2)2 N = 53.3 N.\nThe only remaining question is the angle 0 that the net force FR makes with the\nx axis. We use:\nFRY\ntan 0 =\nFRX\n52.3 N\n= 0.195,\n=\n10.2 N\nand tan-1(0.195) = 11.0°. The net force on the boat has magnitude 53.3 N and\nacts at an 11.0° angle to the x axis.\nWhen solving problems involving Newton's laws and force, it is very important\nto draw a diagram showing all the forces acting on each object involved. Such a dia-\ngram is called a free-body diagram, or force diagram: choose one object, and draw\nan arrow to represent each force acting on it. Include every force acting on that\nobject. Do not show forces that the chosen object exerts on other objects. To help\nyou identify each and every force that is exerted on your chosen object, ask yourself\nwhat other objects could exert a force on it. If your problem involves more than one\nobject, a separate free-body diagram is needed for each object. For now, the likely\nforces that could be acting are gravity and contact forces (one object pushing or\npulling another, normal force, friction).

Remember\nthat another object must exert any force-and there simply isn't any possibility\nhere. Therefore, (a) is wrong. Besides, the force F in Fig. 4-20a would give rise to\nan acceleration by Newton's second law. It is (b) that is correct. No net force\nacts on the puck, and the puck slides at constant velocity across the ice.\nIn the real world, where even smooth ice exerts at least a tiny friction force,\nthen (c) is the correct answer.

Draw a sketch: The situation is shown in Fig. 4-21a; it shows the box and the\nforce applied by the person, Fp .\n2. Free-body diagram: Figure 4-21b shows the free-body diagram of the box. To\ndraw it correctly, we show all the forces acting on the box and only the forces\nacting on the box. They are: the force of gravity mg; the normal force exerted by\nthe table FN; and the force exerted by the person Fp. We are interested only in\ntranslational motion, so we can show the three forces acting at a point, Fig. 4-21c.\n3.

Find (a) the acceleration of\neach box, and (b) the tension in the cord connecting the boxes.\nx\nAPPROACH We streamline our approach by not listing each step. We have two\nboxes so we draw a free-body diagram for each. To draw them correctly, we\nmust consider the forces on each box by itself, so that Newton\'s second law\ncan be applied to each. The person exerts a force Fp on box A. Box A exerts a\nforce Fr on the connecting cord, and the cord exerts an opposite but equal\nmagnitude force Fr back on box A (Newton\'s third law). The two horizontal\nforces on box A are shown in Fig. 4-22b, along with the force of gravity mg\ndownward and the normal force FAN exerted upward by the table. The cord is\nlight, so we neglect its mass. The tension at each end of the cord is thus the same.\nHence the cord exerts a force Fr on the second box. Figure 4-22c shows the\nforces on box B, which are FT, mpg, and the normal force FBN . There will be\nonly horizontal motion. We take the positive x axis to the right.\nSOLUTION (a) We apply EFx = max to box A:\n¿Fx = Fp - FT = mAaA.\n[box A]\nCAUTION\nFor any object, use only\nthe forces on that object in\ncalculating EF = ma\nFor box B, the only horizontal force is FT, SO\n≥Fx = FT = mBaB.\n[box B]\nThe boxes are connected, and if the cord remains taut and doesn\'t stretch, then\nthe two boxes will have the same acceleration a. Thus aA = aB = a. We are\ngiven mA = 10.0 kg and mB = 12.0 kg. We can add the two equations above\nto eliminate an unknown (Fr) and obtain\nor\n(mA + mB)a = Fp - FT + FT = Fp\n40.0N\na =\nFP\n=\nMA + MB\n22.0kg\n= 1.82 m/s2.\nThis is what we sought.\n(b) From the equation for box B above (Fr = mBaB), the tension in the cord is\nFT = ma = (12.0 kg)(1.82 m/s2) = 21.8 N.\nThus, Fr < Fp (= 40.0N), as we expect, since Fr acts to accelerate only mB .\nAlternate Solution to (a) We would have obtained the same result had we consid-\nered a single system, of mass mA + mB, acted on by a net horizontal force equal\nto Fp. (The tension forces Fr would then be considered internal to the system as\na whole, and summed together would make zero contribution to the net force\non the whole system.)\nNOTE It might be tempting to say that the force the person exerts, Fp, acts not\nonly on box A but also on box B. It doesn\'t. Fp acts only on box A. It affects\nbox B via the tension in the cord, Fr, which acts on box B and accelerates it.\n(You could look at it this way: Fr < Fp because Fp accelerates both boxes\nwhereas Fr only accelerates box B.)\n90 CHAPTER 4 Dynamics: Newton\'s Laws of Motion\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 43, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 4-13\nElevator and counterweight (Atwood machine). A system\nof two objects suspended over a pulley by a flexible cable, as shown in Fig. 4-23a,\nis sometimes referred to as an Atwood machine. Consider the real-life appli-\ncation of an elevator (ME) and its counterweight (mc). To minimize the work\ndone by the motor to raise and lower the elevator safely, mE and mc are made\nsimilar in mass. We leave the motor out of the system for this calculation, and\nassume that the cable's mass is negligible and that the mass of the pulley, as well\nas any friction, is small and ignorable. These assumptions ensure that the\ntension Fr in the cable has the same magnitude on both sides of the pulley. Let the\nmass of the counterweight be mc = 1000 kg. Assume the mass of the empty\nelevator is 850 kg, and its mass when carrying four passengers is mE = 1150 kg.\nFor the latter case (mE = 1150 kg), calculate (a) the acceleration of the\nelevator and (b) the tension in the cable.\nAPPROACH Again we have two objects, and we will need to apply Newton's\nsecond law to each of them separately. Each mass has two forces acting on it:\ngravity downward and the cable tension pulling upward, FT. Figures 4-23b\nand c show the free-body diagrams for the elevator (mE) and for the counter-\nweight (mc). The elevator, being the heavier, will accelerate downward,\nwhereas the counterweight will accelerate upward. The magnitudes of their\naccelerations will be equal (we assume the cable is massless and doesn't stretch).\nFor the counterweight, mcg = (1000 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 9800 N, so Fr must be\ngreater than 9800 N (in order that mc will accelerate upward). For the elevator,\nMEg = (1150 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 11,300 N, which must have greater magnitude\nthan Fr so that mE accelerates downward. Thus our calculation must give Fr\nbetween 9800 N and 11,300 N.\nSOLUTION (a) To find Fr as well as the acceleration a, we apply Newton's\nsecond law, ¿F = ma, to each object.

Friction exists between two solid surfaces because even the\nsmoothest looking surface is quite rough on a microscopic scale, Fig. 4-26. When\nwe try to slide an object across a surface, these microscopic bumps impede the\nmotion. Exactly what is happening at the microscopic level is not yet fully under-\nstood. It is thought that the atoms on a bump of one surface may come so close to\nthe atoms of the other surface that attractive electric forces between the atoms\ncould "bond" as a tiny weld between the two surfaces. Sliding an object across a\nsurface is often jerky, perhaps due to the making and breaking of these bonds.\nEven when a round object rolls across a surface, there is still some friction, called\nrolling friction, although it is generally much less than when an object slides across\na surface. We focus now on sliding friction, which is usually called kinetic friction\n(kinetic is from the Greek for "moving").\nWhen an object slides along a rough surface, the force of kinetic friction acts\nopposite to the direction of the object\'s velocity. The magnitude of the force of\nkinetic friction depends on the nature of the two sliding surfaces. For given\nsurfaces, experiment shows that the friction force is approximately proportional\nto the normal force between the two surfaces, which is the force that either\nobject exerts on the other and is perpendicular to their common surface of contact\n(see Fig. 4-27). The force of friction between hard surfaces in many cases depends\nvery little on the total surface area of contact; that is, the friction force on this book\nis roughly the same whether it is being slid across a table on its wide face or on its\nspine, assuming the surfaces have the same smoothness. We consider a simple model\nof friction in which we make this assumption that the friction force is indepen-\ndent of area. Then we write the proportionality between the magnitudes of the\nfriction force Ffr and the normal force FN as an equation by inserting a constant of\nproportionality, pk :\nFIGURE 4-26 An object moving to\nthe right on a table. The two surfaces\nin contact are assumed smooth, but\nare rough on a microscopic scale.\nFIGURE 4-27 When an object is\npulled along a surface by an applied\nforce (FA), the force of friction Ffr\nopposes the motion. The magnitude\nof Ffr is proportional to the\nmagnitude of the normal force (FN).\nFN\nFA\nB\nF\nFfr = Pk FN .\n[kinetic friction]\nThis relation is not a fundamental law; it is an experimental relation between\nthe magnitude of the friction force Ffr , which acts parallel to the two surfaces, and\nthe magnitude of the normal force FN, which acts perpendicular to the surfaces.\nIt is not a vector equation since the two forces have different directions, perpendicular\nto one another. The term uk is called the coefficient of kinetic friction, and its value\ndepends on the nature of the two surfaces. Measured values for a variety of sur-\nfaces are given in Table 4-2. These are only approximate, however, since u depends\non whether the surfaces are wet or dry, on how much they have been sanded or\nrubbed, if any burrs remain, and other such factors. But uk (which has no units) is\nroughly independent of the sliding speed, as well as the area in contact.\nmỹ\nV\nCAUTION\nB\nB\nF\nN\nTABLE 4-2 Coefficients of Friction+\nSurfaces\nCoefficient of\nStatic Friction, us\nCoefficient of\nKinetic Friction, pk\nWood on wood\n0.4\n0.2\nIce on ice\n0.1\n0.03\nMetal on metal (lubricated)\n0.15\n0.07\nSteel on steel (unlubricated)\n0.7\n0.6\nRubber on dry concrete\n1.0\n0.8\nRubber on wet concrete\n0.7\n0.5\nRubber on other solid surfaces\n1-4\n1\nTeflon® on Teflon in air\n0.04\n0.04\nTeflon on steel in air\n0.04\n0.04\nLubricated ball bearings\n<0.01\n<0.01\nSynovial joints (in human limbs)\n0.01\n0.01\n+ Values are approximate and intended only as a guide.\nSECTION 4-8 93\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 46, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FN\nFA\nB\nF\nmỹ\nFIGURE 4-27 Repeated for\nExample 4-16.\nFIGURE 4-28 Example 4-16.\nMagnitude of the force of friction as\na function of the external force\napplied to an object initially at rest.\nAs the applied force is increased in\nmagnitude, the force of static friction\nincreases in proportion until the\napplied force equals us FN .

There is also static friction, which refers to a force parallel to\nthe two surfaces that can arise even when they are not sliding. Suppose an object\nsuch as a desk is resting on a horizontal floor. If no horizontal force is exerted on\nthe desk, there also is no friction force. But now suppose you try to push the\ndesk, and it doesn\'t move. You are exerting a horizontal force, but the desk isn\'t\nmoving, so there must be another force on the desk keeping it from moving (the\nnet force is zero on an object at rest). This is the force of static friction exerted\nby the floor on the desk. If you push with a greater force without moving the desk,\nthe force of static friction also has increased. If you push hard enough, the desk will\neventually start to move, and kinetic friction takes over. At this point, you have\nexceeded the maximum force of static friction, which is given by (Ffr)max = As FN ,\nwhere us is the coefficient of static friction (Table 4-2). Because the force of static\nfriction can vary from zero to this maximum value, we write\nFir S μs FN.\n[static friction]\nYou may have noticed that it is often easier to keep a heavy object sliding\nthan it is to start it sliding in the first place. This is consistent with us generally\nbeing greater than uk (see Table 4-2).\nEXAMPLE 4-16\nFriction: static and kinetic. Our 10.0-kg mystery box rests\non a horizontal floor. The coefficient of static friction is us = 0.40 and the\ncoefficient of kinetic friction is uk = 0.30. Determine the force of friction, Ffr ,\nacting on the box if a horizontal applied force FA is exerted on it of magnitude:\n(a) 0, (b) 10 N, (c) 20 N, (d) 38 N, and (e) 40 N.\nAPPROACH We don\'t know, right off, if we are dealing with static friction or\nkinetic friction, nor if the box remains at rest or accelerates. We need to draw a\nfree-body diagram, and then determine in each case whether or not the box will\nmove: the box starts moving if FA is greater than the maximum static friction\nforce (Newton\'s second law). The forces on the box are gravity mg, the normal\nforce exerted by the floor FN, the horizontal applied force FA, and the fric-\ntion force Ffr, as shown in Fig. 4-27.\nSOLUTION The free-body diagram of the box is shown in Fig. 4-27. In the vertical\ndirection there is no motion, so Newton\'s second law in the vertical direction\ngives ≥Fy = may = 0, which tells us FN - mg = 0. Hence the normal force is\nFN = mg = (10.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 98.0 N.\n(a) Because FA = 0 in this first case, the box doesn\'t move, and Ffr = 0.\n(b) The force of static friction will oppose any applied force up to a maximum of\nPSFN= (0.40)(98.0N) = 39 N.\nWhen the applied force is FA = 10 N, the box will not move. Newton\'s second\nlaw gives ≥Fx = FA - Ffr = 0, so Ffr = 10 N.\n(c) An applied force of 20 N is also not sufficient to move the box. Thus\nFfr = 20 N to balance the applied force.\n(d) The applied force of 38 N is still not quite large enough to move the box;\nso the friction force has now increased to 38 N to keep the box at rest.\n(e) A force of 40 N will start the box moving since it exceeds the maximum force\nof static friction, As FN = (0.40)(98 N) = 39 N. Instead of static friction, we now\nhave kinetic friction, and its magnitude is\nFfr = UkFN= (0.30)(98.0N) = 29 N.\nThere is now a net (horizontal) force on the box of magnitude\nF = 40N - 29N = 11 N, so the box will accelerate at a rate\nΣΕ\nax = == =\n11 N\n10.0 kg\n1.1 m/s2\nas long as the applied force is 40 N. Figure 4-28 shows a graph that summarizes\nthis Example.\n94 CHAPTER 4 Dynamics: Newton\'s Laws of Motion\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 47, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Friction can be a hindrance. It slows down moving objects and causes heating\nand binding of moving parts in machinery. Friction can be reduced by using lubri-\ncants such as oil. More effective in reducing friction between two surfaces is to\nmaintain a layer of air or other gas between them. Devices using this concept,\nwhich is not practical for most situations, include air tracks and air tables in which\nthe layer of air is maintained by forcing air through many tiny holes. Another\ntechnique to maintain the air layer is to suspend objects in air using magnetic\nfields ("magnetic levitation").\nOn the other hand, friction can be helpful. Our ability to walk depends on\nfriction between the soles of our shoes (or feet) and the ground. (Walking involves\nstatic friction, not kinetic friction. Why?) The movement of a car, and also its\nstability, depend on friction. When friction is low, such as on ice, safe walking or\ndriving becomes difficult.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 4-17\nA box against a wall. You can hold a box\nagainst a rough wall (Fig. 4-29) and prevent it from slipping down by pressing\nhard horizontally. How does the application of a horizontal force keep an\nobject from moving vertically?\nRESPONSE This won\'t work well if the wall is slippery. You need friction.\nEven then, if you don\'t press hard enough, the box will slip. The horizontal\nforce you apply produces a normal force on the box exerted by the wall (the\nnet force horizontally is zero since the box doesn\'t move horizontally). The force\nof gravity mg, acting downward on the box, can now be balanced by an upward\nstatic friction force whose maximum magnitude is proportional to the normal\nforce.

They show, for the two cases, the forces exerted\nby you, F (an unknown), by the snow, FN and Ffr, and gravity mg. (a) If you\npush her, and 0 > 0, there is a vertically downward component to your force.\nHence the normal force upward exerted by the ground (Fig. 4-31c) will be\nlarger than mg (where m is the mass of sister plus sled). (b) If you pull her, your\nforce has a vertically upward component, so the normal force FN will be less\nthan mg, Fig. 4-31d. Because the friction force is proportional to the normal\nforce, Ffr will be less if you pull her. So you exert less force if you pull her.\nEXAMPLE 4-20\nTwo boxes and a pulley. In Fig. 4-32a, two boxes are\nconnected by a cord running over a pulley. The coefficient of kinetic friction\nbetween box A and the table is 0.20. We ignore the mass of the cord and pulley\nand any friction in the pulley, which means we can assume that a force applied\nto one end of the cord will have the same magnitude at the other end. We wish\nto find the acceleration, a, of the system, which will have the same magnitude\nfor both boxes assuming the cord doesn\'t stretch. As box B moves down, box A\nmoves to the right.\nAPPROACH The free-body diagrams for each box are shown in Figs. 4-32b and c.\nThe forces on box A are the pulling force of the cord Fr, gravity mA g, the nor-\nmal force exerted by the table FN, and a friction force exerted by the table Ffr ;\nthe forces on box B are gravity mp g, and the cord pulling up, Fr .\nSOLUTION Box A does not move vertically, so Newton\'s second law tells us\nthe normal force just balances the weight,\nFN = mAg = (5.0 kg)(9.8 m/s2) = 49 N.\nIn the horizontal direction, there are two forces on box A (Fig. 4-32b): FT, the\ntension in the cord (whose value we don\'t know), and the force of friction\nFfr = "kFN= (0.20)(49N) = 9.8 N.\nThe horizontal acceleration (box A) is what we wish to find; we use Newton\'s\nsecond law in the x direction, EFAx = MA ax, which becomes (taking the positive\ndirection to the right and setting @Ax = a):\nEFAx = FT - Ffr = MA a.\n[box A]\nNext consider box B. The force of gravity mpg = (2.0 kg)(9.8 m/s2) = 19.6N\npulls downward; and the cord pulls upward with a force Fr. So we can write\nNewton\'s second law for box B (taking the downward direction as positive):\nEFBy = mpg - FT = mBa.\n[box B]\n[Notice that if a # 0, then FT is not equal to mp g.]\nWe have two unknowns, a and Fr, and we also have two equations. We solve\nthe box A equation for FT:\nFT = Ffr + mAa,\nand substitute this into the box B equation:\nmBg - Ffr - MA a = mBa.\nNow we solve for a and put in numerical values:\nmBg - Ffr\n=\n19.6 N - 9.8N\n=\n1.4 m/s2,\na\n=\nMA + MB\n5.0 kg + 2.0 kg\nwhich is the acceleration of box A to the right, and of box B down.\nIf we wish, we can calculate Fr using the third equation up from here:\nFT = Ffr + mAa = 9.8N + (5.0 kg)(1.4 m/s2) = 17 N.\nNOTE Box B is not in free fall. It does not fall at a = g because an additional\nforce, FT, is acting upward on it.\n96 CHAPTER 4\n', 'chapter_title': 'Kinematics in Two Dimensions; Vectors'}, {'page_number': 49, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Inclines\nNow we consider what happens when an object slides down an incline, such as\na hill or ramp. Such problems are interesting because gravity is the accelerating\nforce, yet the acceleration is not vertical. Solving problems is usually easier if we\nchoose the xy coordinate system so the x axis points along the incline (the direction\nof motion) and the y axis is perpendicular to the incline, as shown in Fig. 4-33.\nNote also that the normal force is not vertical, but is perpendicular to the sloping\nsurface of the plane, along the y axis in Fig. 4-33.\nEXERCISE H Is the normal force always perpendicular to an inclined plane? Is it always\nvertical?\nEXAMPLE 4-21\nThe skier. The skier in Fig. 4-34a has begun descending the\n30° slope. If the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.10, what is her acceleration?\nAPPROACH We choose the x axis along the slope, positive downslope in the\ndirection of the skier\'s motion. The y axis is perpendicular to the surface. The\nforces acting on the skier are gravity, FG = mg, which points vertically down-\nward (not perpendicular to the slope), and the two forces exerted on her skis by\nthe snow-the normal force perpendicular to the snowy slope (not vertical), and\nthe friction force parallel to the surface. These three forces are shown acting\nat one point in Fig. 4-34b, which is our free-body diagram for the skier.\nSOLUTION We have to resolve only one vector into components, the weight FG,\nand its components are shown as dashed lines in Fig. 4-34c. To be general, we\nuse 0 rather than 30° for now. We use the definitions of sine ("side opposite")\nand cosine ("side adjacent") to obtain the components:\nFGx = mg sin 0,\nFGy = - mg cos 0\nwhere FGy is in the negative y direction. To calculate the skier\'s acceleration down\nthe hill, ax , we apply Newton\'s second law to the x direction:\n¿Fx = max\nmg sin 0 - 1k FN = max\nwhere the two forces are the x component of the gravity force (+x direction)\nand the friction force (-x direction). We want to find the value of ax, but we\ndon\'t yet know FN in the last equation. Let\'s see if we can get FN from the\ny component of Newton\'s second law:\n≥Fy = may\nFN - mg cos 0 = may = 0\nwhere we set ay = 0 because there is no motion in the y direction (perpendic-\nular to the slope). Thus we can solve for FN :\nFN = mg cos 0\nand we can substitute this into our equation above for max :\nmg sin 0 - uk(mg cos 0) = max .\nThere is an m in each term which can be canceled out. Thus (setting 0 = 30° and\nMk = 0.10):\nax = g sin 30° - pk g cos 30°\n= 0.50g - (0.10)(0.866)g = 0.41g.\nThe skier\'s acceleration is 0.41 times the acceleration of gravity, which in numbers+\nis a = (0.41)(9.8 m/s2) = 4.0 m/s2.\nNOTE The mass canceled out, so we have the useful conclusion that the accelera-\ntion doesn\'t depend on the mass. That such a cancellation sometimes occurs, and\nthus may give a useful conclusion as well as saving calculation, is a big advantage\nof working with the algebraic equations and putting in the numbers only at the end.\n*We used values rounded off to 2 significant figures to obtain a = 4.0 m/s2. If we kept all the extra\ndigits in our calculator, we would find a = 0.4134g ~ 4.1 m/s2.

Mass is a measure of the inertia of an object.\nQuestions\n1. Why does a child in a wagon seem to fall backward when\nyou give the wagon a sharp pull forward?\n2. A box rests on the (frictionless) bed of a truck. The truck\ndriver starts the truck and accelerates forward. The box\nimmediately starts to slide toward the rear of the truck bed.\nDiscuss the motion of the box, in terms of Newton\'s laws, as\nseen (a) by Mary standing on the ground beside the truck,\nand (b) by Chris who is riding on the truck (Fig. 4-35).\nFIGURE 4-35\nQuestion 2.\nB\nBox\n3. If an object is moving, is it possible for the net force acting\non it to be zero? Explain.\n4. If the acceleration of an object is zero, are no forces acting\non it? Explain.\n5. Only one force acts on an object. Can the object have zero\nacceleration? Can it have zero velocity? Explain.\n6. When a golf ball is dropped to the pavement, it bounces\nback up. (a) Is a force needed to make it bounce back up?\n(b) If so, what exerts the force?\nWeight refers to the gravitational force on an object, and is\nequal to the product of the object\'s mass m and the acceleration\nof gravity g:\nFG = mg.\n(4-3)\nForce, which is a vector, can be considered as a push or pull;\nor, from Newton\'s second law, force can be defined as an action\ncapable of giving rise to acceleration. The net force on an object\nis the vector sum of all forces acting on that object.\nWhen two objects slide over one another, the force of\nfriction that each object exerts on the other can be written\napproximately as Ffr = uk FN, where FN is the normal force\n(the force each object exerts on the other perpendicular to their\ncontact surfaces), and uk is the coefficient of kinetic friction. If\nthe objects are at rest relative to each other, then Ffr is just\nlarge enough to hold them at rest and satisfies the inequality\nFfr < Us FN, where us is the coefficient of static friction.\nFor solving problems involving the forces on one or more\nobjects, it is essential to draw a free-body diagram for each\nobject, showing all the forces acting on only that object.\nNewton\'s second law can be applied to the vector components\nfor each object.\n7. If you walk along a log floating on a lake, why does the log\nmove in the opposite direction?\n8.

(a) You pull a box with a constant force across a frictionless\ntable using an attached rope held horizontally.

Explain. (b) What if there is friction?\n12. When an object falls freely under the influence of gravity\nthere is a net force mg exerted on it by the Earth.
