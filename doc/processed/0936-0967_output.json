The basic constitu-\nents of the universe were no longer considered to be atoms (as they had been\nfor 2000 years) but rather the proton, neutron, and electron. Besides these three\n"elementary particles," several others were also known: the positron (a positive\nelectron), the neutrino, and the Y particle (or photon), for a total of six elementary\nparticles.\nBy the 1950s and 1960s many new types of particles similar to the neutron\nand proton were discovered, as well as many "midsized" particles called mesons\nwhose masses were mostly less than nucleon masses but more than the electron\nmass. (Other mesons, found later, have masses greater than nucleons.) Physicists\nfelt that these particles could not all be fundamental, and must be made up of\neven smaller constituents (later confirmed by experiment), which were given the\nname quarks.\nBy the term fundamental particle, we mean a particle that is so simple, so\nbasic, that it has no internal structure* (is not made up of smaller subunits)-see\nChapter-Opening Question 1.\nToday, the fundamental constituents of matter are considered to be quarks (they\nmake up protons and neutrons as well as mesons) and leptons (a class that includes\nelectrons, positrons, and neutrinos). There are also the "carriers of force" known\nas gauge bosons, including the photon, gluons, and W and Z bosons. In addition\nthere is the elusive Higgs boson, predicted in the 1960s but whose first suggestions\nof experimental detection came only in 2011-2013. The theory that describes\nour present view is called the Standard Model. How we came to our present\nunderstanding of elementary particles is the subject of this Chapter.\nOne of the exciting developments of the last few years is an emerging synthesis\nbetween the study of elementary particles and astrophysics (Chapter 33). In fact,\nrecent observations in astrophysics have led to the conclusion that the greater\npart of the mass-energy content of the universe is not ordinary matter but two\nmysterious and invisible forms known as "dark matter" and "dark energy" which\ncannot be explained by the Standard Model in its present form.\nIndeed, we are now aware that the Standard Model is not sufficient. There\nare problems and important questions still unanswered, and we will mention\nsome of them in this Chapter and how we hope to answer them.\n32-1 High-Energy Particles and\nAccelerators\nIn the late 1940s, after World War II, it was found that if the incoming particle in\na nuclear reaction (Section 31-1) has sufficient energy, new types of particles can\nbe produced. The earliest experiments used cosmic rays-particles that impinge\non the Earth from space. In the laboratory, various types of particle accelerators\nhave been constructed to accelerate protons or electrons to high energies so they\ncan collide with other particles-often protons (the hydrogen nucleus). Heavy ions,\nup to lead (Pb), have also been accelerated. These high-energy accelerators have\nbeen used to probe more deeply into matter, to produce and study new particles,\nand to give us information about the basic forces and constituents of nature. The\nparticles produced in high-energy collisions can be detected by a variety of spe-\ncial detectors, discussed in Section 30-13, including scintillation counters, bubble\nchambers, multiwire chambers, and semiconductors. The rate of production of\n+Recall from Section 13-1 that the word "atom" comes from the Greek meaning "indivisible." Atoms\nhave a substructure (protons, neutrons) so are not fundamental. Yet an atom is still the smallest\n"piece" of an element that has the characteristics of that material.\n916 CHAPTER 32 Elementary Particles\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'any group of particles is quantified using the concept of cross section, Section 31-1.\nBecause the projectile particles are at high energy, this field is sometimes called\nhigh-energy physics.\nWavelength and Resolution\nParticles accelerated to high energy can probe the interior of nuclei and nucleons\nor other particles they strike. An important factor is that faster-moving projectiles\ncan reveal more detail. The wavelength of projectile particles is given by\nde Broglie\'s wavelength formula (Eq. 27-8),\n1 = 1 ,\np\n(32-1)\nshowing that the greater the momentum p of the bombarding particle, the shorter\nits wavelength. As discussed in Chapter 25 on optical instruments, resolution of\ndetails in images is limited by the wavelength: the shorter the wavelength, the\nfiner the detail that can be obtained. This is one reason why particle accelerators\nof higher and higher energy have been built in recent years: to probe ever deeper\ninto the structure of matter, to smaller and smaller size.\nEXAMPLE 32-1\nHigh resolution with electrons. What is the wavelength,\nand hence the expected resolution, for 1.3-GeV electrons?\nAPPROACH Because 1.3 GeV is much larger than the electron mass, we must\nbe dealing with relativistic speeds. The momentum of the electrons is found from\nEq. 26-9, and the wavelength is À = h/ p.\nSOLUTION Each electron has KE = 1.3 GeV = 1300 MeV, which is about\n2500 times the rest energy of the electron (mc2 = 0.51 MeV). Thus we can\nignore the term (mc2)2 in Eq. 26-9, E2 = p2c2 + m2c4, and we solve for p:\np =\nV\nE2 - m2c4\nV\nE2\n=\nE\n.\nL\nC2\nc\nTherefore the de Broglie wavelength is\nA = P = hE.\nwhere E = 1.3 GeV.

This resolution of about 1 fm is on the order of the size of nuclei (see\nEq. 30-1).\nNOTE The maximum possible resolution of this beam of electrons is far greater\nthan for a light beam in a light microscope (\\ ~ 500 nm).\n| EXERCISE A What is the wavelength of a proton with KE = 1.00 TeV?\nA major reason today for building high-energy accelerators is that new par-\nticles of greater mass can be produced at higher collision energies, transforming\nthe kinetic energy of the colliding particles into massive particles by E = mc2, as\nwe will discuss shortly. Now we look at particle accelerators.\nFIGURE 32-1 Ernest O. Lawrence,\nleft, with Donald Cooksey and the\n"dees" of an early cyclotron.\nCyclotron\nThe cyclotron was developed in 1930 by E. O. Lawrence (1901-1958; Fig. 32-1)\nat the University of California, Berkeley. It uses a magnetic field to maintain\ncharged ions-usually protons-in nearly circular paths. Although particle physi-\ncists no longer use simple cyclotrons, they are used in medicine for treating cancer,\nand their operating principles are useful for understanding modern accelerators.\nSECTION 32-1 High-Energy Particles and Accelerators 917\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': '∼\nB.\n+\n\'in\nDee\nGap\n-\n-E\n-· A\nExternal beam\nPath\nDee\n8\n8\nFIGURE 32-2 Diagram of a\ncyclotron.

The red\nelectric field lines shown are for the\nalternating electric field in the gap at\na certain moment.\nThe protons move in a vacuum inside two D-shaped cavities, as shown in Fig. 32-2.\nEach time they pass into the gap between the "dees," a voltage accelerates them\n(the electric force), increasing their speed and increasing the radius of curvature\nof their path in the magnetic field. After many revolutions, the protons acquire\nhigh kinetic energy and reach the outer edge of the cyclotron where they strike\na target. The protons speed up only when they are in the gap between the dees,\nand the voltage must be alternating. When protons are moving to the right across\nthe gap in Fig. 32-2, the right dee must be electrically negative and the left one\npositive. A half-cycle later, the protons are moving to the left, so the left dee must\nbe negative in order to accelerate them.\nThe frequency, f, of the applied voltage must be equal to the frequency of the\ncirculating protons. When ions of charge q are circulating within the hollow dees,\nthe net force F on each ion is due to the magnetic field B, so F = quB, where v is\nthe speed of the ion at a given moment (Eq. 20-4). The magnetic force is perpen-\ndicular to both v and B, and does not speed up the ions but causes them to move\nin circles; the acceleration within the dees is centripetal and equals v2/r, where r\nis the radius of the ion\'s path at a given moment.

But the higher this\nvoltage, the fewer the revolutions required to bring the protons to full energy.\n918 CHAPTER 32\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'An important aspect of the cyclotron is that the frequency of the applied\nvoltage, as given by Eq. 32-2, does not depend on the radius r of the particle\'s\npath. Thus the frequency does not have to be changed as the protons or ions start\nfrom the source and are accelerated to paths of larger and larger radii. But this is\nonly true at nonrelativistic energies. At higher speeds, the momentum (Eq. 26-4)\nis p = Ymv = mv/V1 - v2/c2, som in Eq. 32-2 has to be replaced by Ym and\nthe cyclotron frequency f (Eq. 32-2) depends on speed v because Y does. To keep\nthe particles in sync, machines called synchrocyclotrons reduce the frequency in\ntime to correspond to the increase of Ym (in Eq. 32-2) as a packet of charged\nparticles increases in speed more slowly at larger orbits.\nSynchrotron\nAnother way to accelerate relativistic particles is to increase the magnetic field B\nin time so as to keep f (Eq. 32-2) constant as the particles speed up. Such devices\nare called synchrotrons; the particles move in a circle of fixed radius, which can\nbe very large. The larger the radius, the greater the KE of the particles can be for\na given magnetic field strength (see argument on previous page). The biggest\nsynchrotron of all is at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in\nGeneva, Switzerland, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is 4.3 km in radius,\nand 27 km in circumference, and accelerates protons to 4 TeV (soon to be\n7 Te V).\nThe Tevatron accelerator at Fermilab (Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,\nnear Chicago, Illinois, has a radius of 1.0 km.+ The Tevatron accelerated protons\nto about 1000 GeV = 1 TeV (hence its name, 1 TeV = 1012 eV). It was shut down\nin 2011.\nThese large synchrotrons use a narrow ring of magnets (see Fig. 32-3) with\neach magnet placed at the same radius from the center of the circle. The magnets\nare interrupted by gaps where high voltage accelerates the particles to higher\nspeeds. Another way to describe the acceleration is to say the particles "surf" on\na traveling electromagnetic wave within radiofrequency (RF) cavities. (The par-\nticles are first given considerable energy in smaller accelerators, "injectors,"\nbefore being injected into the large ring of the large synchrotron.)\nOne problem of any accelerator is that accelerating electric charges radiate\nelectromagnetic energy (see Chapter 22). Since ions or electrons are accelerated\nin an accelerator, we can expect considerable energy to be lost by radiation.\nThe effect increases with energy and is especially important in circular machines\nwhere centripetal acceleration is present, such as synchrotrons, and hence is called\nsynchrotron radiation. Synchrotron radiation can be useful, however. Intense\nbeams of photons (Y rays) are sometimes needed, and they are often obtained\nfrom an electron synchrotron. Strong sources of such photons are referred to as\nlight sources.\nFIGURE 32-3 The interior of the\ntunnel of the main accelerator at\nFermilab, showing (red) the ring of\nsuperconducting magnets used to\nkeep particles moving in a circular\npath at the 1-TeV Tevatron.\n+Robert Wilson, who helped design the Tevatron, and founded the field of proton therapy\n(Section 31-6), expressed his views on accelerators and national security in this exchange with Senator\nJohn Pastore during testimony before a Congressional Committee in 1969:\nPastore: "Is there anything connected with the hopes of this accelerator [the Tevatron] that in\nany way involves the security of the country?"\nRobert Wilson: "No sir, I don\'t believe so."\nPastore: "Nothing at all?"\nWilson: "Nothing at all. ...

Voltage applied\nto the tubes is alternating so that when electrons (say) reach a gap, the tube in\nfront of them is positive and the one they just left is negative. At low speeds, the\nparticles cover less distance in the same amount of time, so the tubes are shorter at\nfirst. Electrons, with their small mass, get close to the speed of light quickly, v ~ c,\nand the tubes are nearly equal in length. Linear accelerators are particularly impor-\ntant for accelerating electrons to avoid loss of energy due to synchrotron radiation.\nThe largest electron linear accelerator has been at Stanford University (Stanford\nLinear Accelerator Center, or SLAC), about 3 km (2 mi) long, accelerating\nelectrons to 50 GeV.

But to obtain the maximum possible\ncollision energy from a given accelerator, two beams of particles are now acceler-\nated to very high energy and are steered so that they collide head-on. One way to\naccomplish such colliding beams with a single accelerator is through the use of\nstorage rings, in which oppositely circulating beams can be repeatedly brought\ninto collision with one another at particular points. For example, in the\nexperiments that provided strong evidence for the top quark (Section 32-9 and\nFig. 32-15), the Fermilab Tevatron accelerated protons and antiprotons each to\n900 GeV, so that the combined energy of head-on collisions was 1.8 Te V.\nThe largest collider is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, with a\ncircumference of 26.7 km (Fig. 32-5).

To understand our present-day\nview of elementary particles, it is necessary to understand the ideas leading up to\nits formulation.\nElementary particle physics might be said to have begun in 1935 when the\nJapanese physicist Hideki Yukawa (1907-1981) predicted the existence of a new\nparticle that would in some way mediate the strong nuclear force. To understand\nYukawa's idea, we first consider the electromagnetic force. When we first dis-\ncussed electricity, we saw that the electric force acts over a distance, without\ncontact. To better perceive how a force can act over a distance, we used the idea\nof a field. The force that one charged particle exerts on a second can be said to be\ndue to the electric field set up by the first. Similarly, the magnetic field can be\nsaid to carry the magnetic force. Later (Chapter 22), we saw that electromagnetic\n(EM) fields can travel through space as waves. Finally, in Chapter 27, we saw that\nelectromagnetic radiation (light) can be considered as either a wave or as a\ncollection of particles called photons. Because of this wave-particle duality, it is\npossible to imagine that the electromagnetic force between charged particles is\ndue to\n(1) the EM field set up by one charged particle and felt by the other, or\n(2) an exchange of photons (Y particles) between them.\nIt is (2) that we want to concentrate on here, and a crude analogy for how an\nexchange of particles could give rise to a force is suggested in Fig. 32-7. In part (a),\ntwo children start throwing heavy pillows at each other; each throw and each\ncatch results in the child being pushed backward by the impulse. This is the equiv-\nalent of a repulsive force. On the other hand, if the two children exchange pillows\nby grabbing them out of the other person's hand, they will be pulled toward\neach other, as when an attractive force acts.\nFor the electromagnetic force, it is photons exchanged between two charged\nparticles that give rise to the force between them. A simple diagram describ-\ning this photon exchange is shown in Fig. 32-8. Such a diagram, called a\nFeynman diagram after its inventor, the American physicist Richard Feynman\n(1918-1988), is based on the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED).\nFIGURE 32-8 Feynman diagram showing a photon\nacting as the carrier of the electromagnetic force\nbetween two electrons. This is sort of an x vs. t graph,\nwith t increasing upward. Starting at the bottom, two\nelectrons approach each other. As they get close,\nmomentum and energy get transferred from one to\nthe other, carried by a photon (or more than one),\nand the two electrons bounce apart.\ne\nTime\ne\ne\nPhoton\ne\nPosition\nFigure 32-8 represents the simplest case in QED, in which a single photon is\nexchanged. One of the charged particles emits the photon and recoils somewhat\nas a result; and the second particle absorbs the photon. In such a collision or\ninteraction, energy and momentum are transferred from one charged particle to\nthe other, carried by the photon. The photon is absorbed by the second particle\nafter it is emitted by the first particle and is not observable. Hence the photon is\nreferred to as a virtual photon, in contrast to one that is free and can be detected\nby instruments. The photon is said to mediate, or carry, the electromagnetic\nforce.\n922 CHAPTER 32 Elementary Particles\n", 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'By analogy with photon exchange that mediates the electromagnetic force,\nYukawa argued that there ought to be a particle that mediates the strong nuclear\nforce-the force that holds nucleons together in the nucleus. Yukawa called this\npredicted particle a meson (meaning "medium mass"). Figure 32-9 is a Feynman\ndiagram showing the original model of meson exchange: a meson carrying the\nstrong force between a neutron and a proton.\nA rough estimate of the mass of the meson can be made as follows. Suppose\nthe proton on the left in Fig. 32-9 is at rest. For it to emit a meson would require\nenergy (to make the meson\'s mass) which, coming from nowhere, would violate\nconservation of energy.

Conservation of energy is violated only as long as the\nmeson exists, which is the time At required for the meson to pass from one\nnucleon to the other, where it is absorbed and disappears. If we assume the\nmeson travels at relativistic speed, close to the speed of light c, then At need be\nat most about At = d/c, where d is the maximum distance that can separate the\ninteracting nucleons.

Then from Eq. 32-3,\nhc=\n(6.6×10-34 J·s)(3.0×108m/s)\n~ 2.1×10-11 J = 130 MeV.\nmc2 ~\n2Trd\n(6.28)(1.5 × 10-15 m)\nThe mass of the predicted meson, roughly 130 MeV/c2, is about 250 times the\nelectron mass of 0.51 MeV/c2.\nEXERCISE B What effect does an increase in the mass of the virtual exchange particle\nhave on the range of the force it mediates? (a) Decreases it; (b) increases it; (c) has no\nappreciable effect; (d) decreases the range for charged particles and increases the range\nfor neutral particles.\nNote that since the electromagnetic force has infinite range, Eq. 32-3 with\nd = oo tells us that the exchanged particle for the electromagnetic force, the\nphoton, will have zero mass, which it does.\nThe particle predicted by Yukawa was discovered in cosmic rays by C. F.\nPowell and G. Occhialini in 1947, and is called the "T" or pi meson, or simply the\npion. It comes in three charge states: +e, -e, or 0, where e = 1.6 × 10-19 C.\nThe Tr+ and T have mass of 139.6 MeV/c2 and the Trº a mass of 135.0 MeV/c2, all\nclose to Yukawa\'s prediction. All three interact strongly with matter.

The\nelectromagnetic force is carried by the photon, the strong force by gluons. What\nabout the other two: the weak force and gravity? These too are believed to be\nmediated by particles. The particles that transmit the weak force are referred to\nas the W+, W", and Zº, and were detected in 1983 (Fig. 32-10). The quantum\n(or carrier) of the gravitational force has been named the graviton, but its\nexistence has not been detected and it may not be detectable.\nA comparison of the four forces is given in Table 32-1, where they are listed\naccording to their (approximate) relative strengths. Although gravity may be the\nmost obvious force in daily life (because of the huge mass of the Earth), on a\nnuclear scale gravity is by far the weakest of the four forces and its effect at the\nparticle level can nearly always be ignored.\nTABLE 32-1 The Four Forces in Nature\nType\nRelative Strength (approx.,\nfor 2 protons in nucleus)\nField Particle\nStrong\n1\nGluons (= g)\nElectromagnetic\n10-2\nPhoton (= Y)\nWeak\n10-6\nW+ and Zº\nGravitational\n10-38\nGraviton (?)\n32-3 Particles and Antiparticles\nThe positron, as we discussed in Sections 27-6 (pair production) and 30-5\n(B+ decay), is basically a positive electron. That is, many of its properties are the\nsame as for the electron, such as mass, but it has the opposite electric charge\n(+e). Other quantum numbers that we will discuss shortly are also reversed. The\npositron is said to be the antiparticle to the electron.\nThe positron was first detected as a curved path in a cloud chamber in a\nmagnetic field by Carl Anderson in 1932. It was predicted that other particles\nalso would have antiparticles. It was decades before another type was found.\n924 CHAPTER 32 Elementary Particles\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'TT\nIA\n(not\nseen)\np\nTT\n1\np\np\nFIGURE 32-11 Liquid-hydrogen bubble-\nchamber photograph of an antiproton (p)\ncolliding with a proton at rest, producing a\nXi-anti-Xi pair (p + p → = + =+) that\nsubsequently decay into other particles.

A bar, such as over the p, is used to indicate the antiparticle (p).\nSoon after, the antineutron (n) was found. All particles have antiparticles. But a\nfew, like the photon, the Trº, and the Higgs, do not have distinct antiparticles-we\nsay that they are their own antiparticles.\nAntiparticles are produced in nuclear reactions when there is sufficient\nenergy available to produce the required mass, and they do not live very long in\nthe presence of matter. For example, a positron is stable when by itself but rarely\nsurvives for long; as soon as it encounters an electron, the two annihilate each\nother. The energy of their vanished mass, plus any kinetic energy they possessed,\nis usually converted into the energy of two Y rays. Annihilation also occurs for\nall other particle-antiparticle pairs.\nAntimatter is a term referring to material that would be made up of\n"antiatoms" in which antiprotons and antineutrons would form the nucleus\naround which positrons (antielectrons) would move. The term is also used for\nantiparticles in general. If there were pockets of antimatter in the universe,\na huge explosion would occur if it should encounter normal matter. It is believed\nthat antimatter was prevalent in the very early universe (Section 33-7).\nFIGURE 32-12 Emilio Segrè: he\nworked with Fermi in the 1930s, later\ndiscovered the first "man-made"\nelement, technetium, and other\nelements, and then the antiproton.\nThe inscription below the photo is\nfrom a book by Segrè given to this\nbook\'s author.\n*\nNegative Sea of Electrons; Vacuum State\nThe original idea for antiparticles came from a relativistic wave equation devel-\noped in 1928 by the Englishman P. A. M. Dirac (1902-1984). Recall that, as we\nsaw in Chapter 26, the total energy E of a particle with mass m and momentum p\nand zero potential energy is given by Eq. 26-9, E2 = p2c2 + m2c4. Thus\nEmilio Segués.\nFeber 20 1985\nTo enlist the help of the subjects of this\nlook for the next edition of giancoli\'s\ntexts\nE = +Vp2c2 + m2c4.\nDirac applied his new equation and found that it included solutions with both\n+ and - signs. He could not ignore the solution with the negative sign, which we\nmight have thought unphysical. If those negative energy states are real, then we\nwould expect normal free electrons to drop down into those states, emitting\nSECTION 32-3 Particles and Antiparticles 925\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 32-13 (a) Possible energy states\nfor an electron.

To deal with this difficulty, Dirac postu-\nlated that all those negative energy states are normally occupied. That is, what we\nthought was the vacuum is instead a vast sea of electrons in negative energy\nstates (Fig. 32-13a). These electrons are not normally observable. But if a photon\nstrikes one of these negative energy electrons, that electron can be knocked up to\na normal (E > mc2) energy state as shown in Fig. 32-13b. Note in Fig. 32-13\nthat there are no energy states between E = - mc2 and E = +mc2 (because\np2 cannot be negative in the equation E = + Vp2c2 + m2c4). The photon that\nknocks an e" from the negative sea up to a normal state (Fig. 32-13b) must have\nan energy greater than 2mc2. What is left behind is a hole (as in semiconductors,\nSections 29-7 and 29-8) with positive charge. We call that "hole" a positron, and\nit can move around as a free particle with positive energy. Thus Fig. 32-13b\nrepresents (Section 27-6) pair production: > > e et.\nThe vast sea of electrons with negative energy in Fig. 32-13 is the vacuum (or\nvacuum state). According to quantum mechanics, the vacuum is not empty, but\ncontains electrons and other particles as well. The uncertainty principle allows\na particle to jump briefly up to a normal energy, thus creating a particle-antiparticle\npair. It is possible that they could be the source of the recently discovered dark\nenergy that fills the universe (Chapter 33). We still have a lot to learn.\n32-4 Particle Interactions and\nConservation Laws\nOne of the important uses of high-energy accelerators and colliders is to study\nthe interactions of elementary particles with each other. As a means of ordering\nthis subnuclear world, the conservation laws are indispensable. The laws of\nconservation of energy, of momentum, of angular momentum, and of electric\ncharge are found to hold precisely in all particle interactions.\nA study of particle interactions has revealed a number of new conservation\nlaws which (just like the old ones) are ordering principles: they help to explain\nwhy some reactions occur and others do not. For example, the following reaction\nhas never been observed:\np+n=p+p+p\neven though charge, energy, and so on, are conserved (> means the reaction\ndoes not occur). To understand why such a reaction does not occur, physicists\nhypothesized a new conservation law, the conservation of baryon number.\n(Baryon number is a generalization of nucleon number, which we saw earlier is\nconserved in nuclear reactions and decays.) All nucleons are defined to have\nbaryon number B = +1, and all antinucleons (antiprotons, antineutrons) have\nB = - 1. All other types of particles, such as photons, mesons, and electrons and\n926 CHAPTER 32 Elementary Particles\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'other leptons, have B = 0. The reaction shown at the start of this paragraph does\nnot conserve baryon number since the left side has B = (+1) + (+1) = +2,\nand the right has B = (+1) + (+1) + (-1)= +1. On the other hand, the\nfollowing reaction does conserve B and does occur if the incoming proton has\nsufficient energy:\np + p -> p + p +p+p,\nB= +1+1 = +1+1-1 + 1.\nAs indicated, B = +2 on both sides of this equation. From these and other\nreactions, the conservation of baryon number has been established as a basic\nprinciple of physics.\nAlso useful are conservation laws for the three lepton numbers, associated\nwith weak interactions including decays. In ordinary ß decay, an electron or posi-\ntron is emitted along with a neutrino or antineutrino. In another type of decay,\na particle known as a "u" or muon, can be emitted instead of an electron.\nThe muon (discovered in 1937) seems to be much like an electron, except its\nmass is 207 times larger (106 MeV/c2). The neutrino (ve) that accompanies an\nemitted electron is found to be different from the neutrino (vu) that accompanies\nan emitted muon. Each of these neutrinos has an antiparticle: ve and vu . In\nordinary ß decay we have, for example,\nn -> p + e + ve\nbut not n => p + e + vu. To explain why these do not occur, the concept of\nelectron lepton number, Le, was invented. If the electron (e ) and the electron\nneutrino (ve) are assigned Le = +1, and e+ and ve are assigned Le = - 1,\nwhereas all other particles have Le = 0, then all observed decays conserve Le .\nFor example, in n -> p + e" + ve, initially Le = 0, and afterward\nLe=0+ (+1) + (-1) = 0. Decays that do not conserve Le , even though they\nwould obey the other conservation laws, are not observed to occur.\nIn a decay involving muons, such as\nIT+ > p+ + vu,\na second quantum number, muon lepton number (Lu), is conserved. The u" and vu\nare assigned Lu = +1, and their antiparticles u+ and vu have Lu = - 1, whereas\nall other particles have Lu = 0. Lu too is conserved in interactions and decays.\nSimilar assignments can be made for the tau lepton number, L,, associated with\nthe T lepton (discovered in 1976 with mass more than 3000 times the electron\nmass) and its neutrino, v7 .\nAntiparticles have not only opposite electric charge from their particles, but\nalso opposite B, Le, Lu, and L .. For example, a neutron has B = +1, an\nantineutron has B = - 1 (and all the L\'s are zero).\n!\nCAUTION\nThe different types of neutrinos\nare not identical\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 32-4\nLepton number in muon decay.

This is the initial state for all\ndecays given, and the final state must also have Lu = +1, Le = 0.

The final state of\n(b) has Lu = 0 + 0 + 1 = +1 and Le = +1 -1 + 0 = 0, so both Lu and\nLe are conserved. This is in fact the most common decay mode of the u". Lastly,\n(c) does not occur because Le (= +2 in the final state) is not conserved, nor\nis Lu-\nSECTION 32-4 Particle Interactions and Conservation Laws 927\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 32-5\nEnergy and momentum are conserved. In addition to the\n"number" conservation laws which help explain the decay schemes of particles,\nwe can also apply the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.

Then KEp = 116 MeV - 97 MeV = 19 MeV.\n32-5 Neutrinos\nWe first met neutrinos with regard to ß decay in Section 30-5. The study of\nneutrinos is a "hot" subject today. Experiments are being carried out in deep\nunderground laboratories, sometimes in deep mine shafts. The thick layer of\nearth above is meant to filter out all other "background" particles, leaving mainly\nthe very weakly interacting neutrinos to arrive at the detectors.\nSome very important results have come to the fore in recent years. First there\nwas the solar neutrino problem. The energy output of the Sun is believed to be\ndue to the nuclear fusion reactions discussed in Chapter 31, Eqs. 31-6 and 31-7.\nThe neutrinos emitted in these reactions are all ve (accompanied by e+). But\nthe rate at which ve arrive at Earth was measured starting in the late 1960s to be\nmuch less than expected based on the power output of the Sun. It was then pro-\nposed that, on the long trip between Sun and Earth, ve might turn into vu or vr .\nSubsequent experiments, definitive only in 2001, confirmed this hypothesis. Thus\nthe three neutrinos, Ve, Vu, VT, can change into one another in certain cir-\ncumstances, a phenomenon called neutrino flavor oscillationt. (Each of the three\nneutrino types is called, whimsically, a different "flavor.") This result suggests\nthat the lepton numbers Le , Lu, and L, are not perfectly conserved. But the sum,\nLe + Lu + L,, is believed to be always conserved.\n*Neutrino oscillations had first been proposed in 1957 by Bruno Pontecorvo. He also proposed that\nthe electron and muon neutrinos are different species; and he also suggested a way to confirm the\nexistence of neutrinos by detecting ve emitted in huge numbers by a nuclear reactor, an experiment\ncarried out by Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan in the 1950s. The experimentalists who confirmed\nthese two predictions were awarded the Nobel Prize, but not the theorist who proposed them.\n928 CHAPTER 32\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The second exceptional result has long been speculated on: are neutrinos\nmassless as originally thought, or do they have a nonzero mass? Rough upper\nlimits on the masses have been made. Today astrophysical experiments show that\nthe sum of all three neutrino masses combined is less than about 0.14 eV/c2. But\ncan all the masses be zero? Not if there are the flavor oscillations discussed above.\nIt seems that at most, one type could have zero mass, and it is likely that at least\none neutrino type has a mass of at least 0.04 eV/c2.\nAs a result of neutrino oscillations, the three types of neutrino may not be\nexactly what we thought they were (e, u, T). If not, the three basic neutrinos,\ncalled 1, 2, and 3, are combinations of ve , Vu , and v7 .\nAnother outstanding question is whether or not neutrinos are in the category\ncalled Majorana particles,+ meaning they would be their own antiparticles, like\nY, TTº, and Higgs. If so, a lot of other questions (and answers) would appear.\nNeutrino Mass Estimate from a Supernova\n*\nThe explosion of a supernova in the outer parts of our Galaxy in 1987\n(Section 33-2) released lots of neutrinos and offered an opportunity to estimate\nelectron neutrino mass. If neutrinos do have mass, then their speed would be less\nthan c, and neutrinos of different energy would take different times to travel the\n170,000 light-years from the supernova to Earth. To get an idea of how such a\nmeasurement could be done, suppose two neutrinos from "SN1987A" were\nemitted at the same time and were actually detected on Earth (via the reaction\nve + p -> n + e+) 10 seconds apart, with measured kinetic energies of about\n20 Me V and 10 MeV. From other laboratory measurements we expect the neutrino\nmass to be less than 100 eV; and since our neutrinos have kinetic energy of 20 MeV\nand 10 MeV, we can make the approximation my c2 << E, so that E (the total\nenergy) is essentially equal to the kinetic energy. We use Eq. 26-6b, which tells us\nE =\nmyc2\n.\n11 - v2/c2\nWe solve this for v, the velocity of a neutrino with energy E:\nm2 c4\n(1 - 2p +)\nv\n( 1 - mps)?\n=\n=\nm2c4) 2\nwhere we have used the binomial expansion (1 - x)= = 1 - 2x + ..; and we\nignore higher-order terms since m2c4 << E2.

The\ndifference in arrival times for our two neutrinos of energies E1 = 20 MeV and\nE2 = 10 MeV is\nd m2 c4\nc 2 (\n1\nE2\nt2 - 41 =\n-1).\nE2)\nWe solve this for mục2 and set t2 - t1 = 10 s:\nL\n2c(t2 - 41) EZE2\n2\n= 22 × 10-6 MeV = 22 eV.\nmyc2 =\nd\nE2 - E2\n1\nThis calculation, with its optimistic assumptions, estimates the mass of the neu-\ntrino to be 22 eV/c2. But there would be experimental uncertainties, and even\nworse there is the unwarranted assumption that the two neutrinos were emitted\nat the same time.\n*The brilliant young physicist Ettore Majorana (1906-1938) disappeared from a ship under\nmysterious circumstances in 1938 at the age of 31.\nSECTION 32-5 Neutrinos 929\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Theoretical models of supernova explosions suggest that the neutrinos are\nemitted in a burst that lasts from a second or two up to perhaps 10 s. If we assume\nthe neutrinos are not emitted simultaneously but rather at any time over a 10-s\ninterval, then that 10-s difference in arrival times could be due to a 10-s differ-\nence in their emission time. In this case the data would be consistent with zero\nneutrino mass, and it put an approximate upper limit of 22 eV/c2.\nThe actual detection of these neutrinos was brilliant-it was a rare event that\nallowed us to detect something other than EM radiation from beyond the solar\nsystem, and was an exceptional confirmation of theory. In the experiments, the\nmost sensitive detector consisted of several thousand tons of water in an under-\nground chamber. It detected 11 events in 12 seconds, probably via the reaction\nVe + p -> n + e+. There was not a clear correlation between energy and time of\narrival. Nonetheless, a careful analysis of that experiment set a rough upper limit\non the electron antineutrino mass of about 4 eV/c2. The more recent results\nmentioned above are much more definitive-they provide evidence that mass is\nmuch smaller, and that it is not zero-but precise neutrino masses still elude us.\n32-6 Particle Classification\nIn the decades after the discovery of the Tr meson in the late 1940s, hundreds of\nother subnuclear particles were discovered. One way to categorize the particles\nis according to their interactions, since not all particles interact via all four of the\nforces known in nature (though all interact via gravity). Table 32-2 (next page) lists\nsome of the more common particles classified in this way along with many of their\nproperties. At the top of Table 32-2 are the so-called "fundamental" particles which\nwe believe have no internal structure. Below them are some of the "composite"\nparticles which are made up of quarks, according to the Standard Model.\nThe fundamental particles include the gauge bosons (so-named after the\ntheory that describes them, gauge theory), which include the gluons, the photon,\nand the W and Z particles; these are the particles that mediate (or "carry") the\nstrong, electromagnetic, and weak interactions, respectively.\nAlso fundamental are the leptons, which are particles that do not interact via\nthe strong force but do interact via the weak nuclear force. Leptons that carry\nelectric charge also interact via the electromagnetic force. The leptons include\nthe electron, the muon, and the tau, and three types of neutrino: the electron neu-\ntrino (ve), the muon neutrino (vu), and the tau neutrino (vr). Each lepton has an\nantiparticle. Finally, the recently detected Higgs boson is also considered to be\nfundamental, with no internal structure.\nThe second category of particle in Table 32-2 is the hadrons, which are\ncomposite particles (made up of quarks as we will discuss shortly). Hadrons are\nparticles that interact via the strong nuclear force and are said to be strongly interacting\nparticles. They also interact via the other forces, but the strong force predominates\nat short distances. The hadrons include the proton, neutron, pion, and many\nother particles. They are divided into two subgroups: baryons, which are particles\nthat have baryon number +1 (or -1 in the case of their antiparticles) and, as we\nshall see, are each made up of three quarks; and mesons, which have baryon\nnumber = 0, and are made up of a quark and an antiquark.\nOnly a few of the hundreds of hadrons (a veritable "zoo") are included in\nTable 32-2. Notice that the baryons A, E, E, and 22 all decay to lighter-mass\nbaryons, and eventually to a proton or neutron. All these processes conserve\nbaryon number. Since there is no particle lighter than the proton with B = +1,\nif baryon number is strictly conserved, the proton itself cannot decay and is\nstable. (But see Section 32-11.) Note that Table 32-2 gives the mean life (T) of\neach particle (as is done in particle physics), not the half-life (T}). Recall that\nthey differ by a factor 0.693: T = T}/In 2 = T1/0.693, Eq. 30-7. The term\nlifetime in particle physics means the mean life T (= mean lifetime).\nThe baryon and lepton numbers (B, Le, Lu, L.), as well as strangeness S\n(Section 32-8), as given in Table 32-2 are for particles; their antiparticles have\nopposite sign for these numbers.\n930 CHAPTER 32 Elementary Particles\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'TABLE 32-2 Particles (selected)+\nCategory\nForces\ninvolved\nParticle\nname\nSymbol\nAnti-\nparticle Spin\nMass\nMean life\n(s)\nPrincipal Decay Modes\nFundamental\nGauge bosons str\n(force\nGluons\ng\nSelf\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nStable\ncarriers)\nem\nPhoton\ng\nSelf\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nStable\nw, em\nW\nW+\nW-\n1\n80.385 × 103\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3 ×10-25\neve, μνμ, TV,, hadrons\nw\nZ\nZo\nSelf\n1\n91.19 × 103\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3 ×10-25\nete , utp, ++, hadrons\nHiggs boson\nw, str\nHiggs\nH0\nSelf\n0\n125 × 103\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1.6 × 10-22\nbb, ZºZº, w+W", gg, TT, YY\nLeptons\nw, em#\nElectron\n–\ne+\n1\n2\n0.511\n0\n+1\n0\n0\n0\nStable\nNeutrino (e)\nVe\n–\nVe\n1\n2\n0 (<0.14 eV/c2)*\n0\n+1\n0\n0\n0\nStable\nMuon\nm\n±\nm\n1\n2\n105.7\n0\n0\n+1\n0\n0\n2.20 × 10-6\ne velu\nNeutrino (u)\nVu\n1\n2\n0 (<0.14 eV/c2)*\n0\n0\n+1\n0\n0\nStable\nTau\nt\n2\n1\n1777\n0\n0\n0\n+1\n0\n2.91 × 10-13\nM vuVT, e veV, hadrons +v,\nNeutrino (T)\nv.\n-IN\n0 (<0.14 eV/c2)* 0\n0\n0 +1\n0\nStable\nQuarks\nw, em, str\n(see Table 32-3)\nHadrons (composite), selected\nMesons\nstr, em, w Pion\nTT+\nTT\n0\n139.6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2.60 × 10-8\nμ΄νμ\n(quark-\nantiquark)\nSelf\n0\n135.0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.85 × 10-16\n2Y\nKaon\nK+\nK-\n0\n493.7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n+1\n1.24 × 10-8\nM+ Vu, IT+TTO\nKS\nK9\n0\n497.6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n+1\n0.895 × 10-10\nTT+ TT , 2770\nKL\nKL\n0\n497.6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n+1\n5.12 × 10-8\nIT+ eF Ve, I+ M+ Vu, 3TT\nEta\nnº\nSelf\n0\n547.9\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n5.1 × 10-19\n2Y, 3TT0, TT TT TTº\nRho\npo\nSelf\n1\n775\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4.4 × 10-24\nTT+T , 2770\np+\np\n1\n775\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4.4× 10-24\nTT +TO\nand others\nBaryons\n(3 quarks)\nstr, em, w\nProton\np\no\n1\n2\n938.3\n+1\n0\n0\n0\n0\nStable\nNeutron\nn\nn\n1\n2\n939.6\n+1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n882\npe ve\nLambda\n10\n0\n¶\n1\n2\n1115.7\n+1\n0\n0\n0\n-1\n2.63 × 10-10\nPT , nTTº\nSigma\nE+\nΣ-\n1\n2\n1189.4\n+1\n0\n0\n0\n-1\n0.80 × 10-10\nPTTº, nT+\n20\n1\n2\n1192.6\n+1\n0\n0\n0\n-1\n7.4 × 10-20\nA0y\nΣ\'\n±\n©\n1\n2\n1197.4\n+1\n0\n0\n0\n-1\n1.48 × 10-10\nwow, AK,=πo\nXi\n0\n–\n0\n2\n1314.9\n+1\n0\n0\n0\n-2\n2.90 × 10-10\n1ºTTO\n–\n±\n1\n2\n1321.7\n+1\n0\n0\n0\n-2\n1.64 × 10-10\n–\np\nOmega\nQ+\n3\n2\n1672.5\n+1\n0\n0\n0\n-3\n0.82 × 10-10\nand others\nB Le Lu L, S\n(MeV/c2) [antiparticles have opposite sign]\n*See also Table 32-4 for particles with charm and bottom.

The lifetime of an unstable par-\nticle depends on which force is most active in causing the decay. When a stronger\nforce influences a decay, that decay occurs more quickly. Decays caused by the\nweak force typically have lifetimes of 10-13 s or longer (W and Z decay directly\nand more quickly). Decays via the electromagnetic force have much shorter\nlifetimes, typically about 10-16 to 10-19 s, and normally involve a Y (photon).\nMost of the unstable particles included in Table 32-2 decay either via the weak or\nthe electromagnetic interaction.\nMany particles have been found that decay via the strong interaction, with\nvery short lifetimes, typically about 10-23 s. Their lifetimes are so short they do\nnot travel far enough to be detected before decaying. The existence of such\nshort-lived particles is inferred from their decay products. Consider the first such\nparticle discovered (by Fermi), using a beam of T+ particles with varying\namounts of energy directed through a hydrogen target (protons). The number of\ninteractions (TT+ scattered) plotted versus the pion\'s kinetic energy is shown in\nFig. 32-14. The large number of interactions around 200 MeV led Fermi to\nconclude that the Tr+ and proton combined momentarily to form a short-lived\nparticle before coming apart again, or at least that they resonated together for a\nshort time. Indeed, the large peak in Fig. 32-14 resembles a resonance curve (see\nFigs. 11-18 and 21-46), and this new "particle"-now called the A-is referred\nto as a resonance. Hundreds of other resonances have been found, and are\nregarded as excited states of lighter mass particles such as a nucleon.\n4\nFIGURE 32-14 Number of Tr + particles\nscattered elastically by a proton target\nas a function of the incident Tr+\nkinetic energy.

Charm?\nTowards a New Model\nIn the early 1950s, the newly found particles K, A, and 2 were found to behave\nrather strangely in two ways. First, they were always produced in pairs. For\nexample, the reaction\nTT + p -> K0 + Aº\noccurred with high probability, but the similar reaction " + p >> K0 + n was\nnever observed to occur even though it did not violate any known conservation law.\nThe second feature of these strange particles, as they came to be called, was that\nthey were produced via the strong interaction (that is, at a high interaction rate),\n932 CHAPTER 32\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'but did not decay at a fast rate characteristic of the strong interaction (even\nthough they decayed into strongly interacting particles).\nTo explain these observations, a new quantum number, strangeness, and a\nnew conservation law, conservation of strangeness, were introduced. By assigning\nthe strangeness numbers (S) indicated in Table 32-2, the production of strange\nparticles in pairs was explained. Antiparticles were assigned opposite strange-\nness from their particles. For example, in the reaction TT" + p -> Kº + Aº,\nthe initial state has strangeness S = 0 + 0 = 0, and the final state has\nS = +1 - 1 = 0, so strangeness is conserved. But for T + p >> K0 + n, the\ninitial state has S = 0 and the final state has S = +1 + 0 = +1, so strangeness\nwould not be conserved; and this reaction is not observed.\nTo explain the decay of strange particles, it is assumed that strangeness is\nconserved in the strong interaction but is not conserved in the weak interaction.\nThus, strange particles were forbidden by strangeness conservation to decay to\nnonstrange particles of lower mass via the strong interaction, but could decay by\nmeans of the weak interaction at the observed longer lifetimes of 10-10 to 10-8 s.\nThe conservation of strangeness was the first example of a partially conserved\nquantity. In this case, the quantity strangeness is conserved by strong interactions\nbut not by weak.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 32-7\nGuess the missing particle. Using the\nconservation laws for particle interactions, determine the possibilities for the\nmissing particle in the reaction\nTT + p -> Kº + ?\nin addition to Kº + Aº mentioned above.\nRESPONSE We write equations for the conserved numbers in this reaction,\nwith B, Le, S, and Q as unknowns whose determination will reveal what the\npossible particle might be:\nBaryon number:\n0+1 =0+ B\nLepton number:\n0 + 0 = 0 + Le\nCharge:\n-1 + 1 = 0 + Q\nStrangeness:\n0 + 0 = 1 + S.\nThe unknown product particle would have to have these characteristics:\nB = +1\nLe = 0 Q = 0 S = - 1.\nIn addition to Aº, a neutral sigma particle, 2º, is also consistent with these\nnumbers.\nCAUTION\nPartially conserved quantities\nIn the next Section we will discuss another partially conserved quantity\nwhich was given the name charm. The discovery in 1974 of a particle with charm\nhelped solidify a new theory involving quarks, which we now discuss.\n32-9 Quarks\nOne difference between leptons and hadrons is that the hadrons interact via the\nstrong interaction, whereas the leptons do not. There is an even more fundamen-\ntal difference. The six leptons (e, M, T, Ve, Vu, V) are considered to be truly\nfundamental particles because they do not show any internal structure, and have\nno measurable size. (Attempts to determine the size of leptons have put an upper\nlimit of about 10-18 m.) On the other hand, there are hundreds of hadrons, and\nexperiments indicate they do have an internal structure. When an electron\ncollides with another electron, it scatters off as per Coulomb\'s law. But electrons\nscattering off a proton reveal a more complex pattern, implying internal parts\nwithin the proton (= quarks).\nSECTION 32-9 Quarks 933\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 32-15 This computer-generated reconstruction of a\nproton-antiproton collision at Fermilab occurred at an energy\nof nearly 2 TeV.

The three quarks originally\nproposed were named up, down, and strange, with abbreviations u, d, s. The\ntheory today has six quarks, just as there are six leptons-based on a presumed\nsymmetry in nature. The other three quarks are called charm, bottom, and top (c, b, t).\nThe names apply also to new properties of each quark (quantum numbers c, b, t) that\ndistinguish these new quarks from the 3 original quarks (see Table 32-3). These\nproperties (like strangeness) are conserved in strong, but not weak, interactions.\nFigure 32-15 shows one of the events that provided evidence for the top quark.\nAll quarks have spin 2 and an electric charge of either + 3e or - ge (that is,\na fraction of the previously thought smallest charge e).

Mesons consist of a quark-antiquark pair. For\nexample, a Tr+ meson is a ud combination: note that for the ud pair (Table 32-3),\nQ= 3e + je = +1e, B = } - } = 0, S = 0 + 0 = 0, as they must for a T+;\nand a K+ = us, with Q = +1, B = 0, S = +1. A TTº can be made of uu or dd.\nBaryons, on the other hand, consist of three quarks. For example, a neutron\nis n = ddu, whereas an antiproton is p = uud. See Fig. 32-16. Strange parti-\ncles all contain an s or\'s quark, whereas charm particles contain a c or c quark.\nA few of these hadrons are listed in Table 32-4.\nCurrent models suggest that quarks may be so tightly bound together that\nthey may not ever exist singly in the free state. But quarks can be detected\nindirectly when they turn into narrow jets of other particles, as in Fig. 32-15.\nAlso, observations of very high energy electrons scattered off protons suggest\nthat protons are indeed made up of constituents.\nToday, the truly fundamental particles are considered to be the six quarks,\nthe six leptons, the gauge bosons that carry the fundamental forces, and the\nHiggs (page 939). See Table 32-5, where the quarks and leptons are arranged in\nthree "families" or "generations." Ordinary matter-atoms made of protons,\nneutrons, and electrons-is contained in the "first generation." The others are\nthought to have existed in the very early universe, but are seen by us today only\nat powerful colliders or in cosmic rays.

The distinction between the six types of quark (u, d, s, c, b, t) was\nreferred to as flavor. According to theory, each flavor of quark can have one of\nthree colors, usually designated red, green, and blue. (These are the three primary\ncolors which, when added together in appropriate amounts, as on a TV screen,\nproduce white.) Note that the names "color" and "flavor" have nothing to do with\nour senses, but are purely whimsical-as are other names, such as charm, in this\nnew field. (We did, however, "color" the quarks in Fig. 32-16.) The antiquarks are\ncolored antired, antigreen, and antiblue. Baryons are made up of three quarks,\none of each color. Mesons consist of a quark-antiquark pair of a particular color\nand its anticolor. Both baryons and mesons are thus colorless or white.\nOriginally, the idea of quark color was proposed to preserve the Pauli exclu-\nsion principle (Section 28-7). Not all particles obey the exclusion principle.\nThose that do, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, are called fermions.\nThose that don\'t are called bosons. These two categories are distinguished also\nin their spin: bosons have integer spin (0, 1, 2, etc.) whereas fermions have\nhalf-integer spin, usually 2 as for electrons and nucleons, but other fermions\nhave spin 2, 2, etc. Matter is made up mainly of fermions, but the carriers of\nthe forces (Y, W, Z, and gluons) are all bosons. Quarks are fermions (they have\nspin 2) and therefore should obey the exclusion principle. Yet for three particular\nbaryons (uuu, ddd, and sss), all three quarks would have the same quantum\nnumbers, and at least two quarks have their spin in the same direction (since\nthere are only two choices, spin up [ms = +2] or spin down [ms = - 2]). This\nwould seem to violate the exclusion principle; but if quarks have that additional\nquantum number color, which is different for each quark, it would serve to\ndistinguish them and allow the exclusion principle to hold. Although quark color,\n936 CHAPTER 32 Elementary Particles\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 23, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'and the resulting threefold increase in the number of quarks, was originally an\nad hoc idea, it also served to bring the theory into better agreement with experiment,\nsuch as predicting the correct lifetime of the TTº meson, and the measured rate of\nhadron production in observed ete" collisions at accelerators. The idea of color\nsoon became a central feature of the theory as determining the force binding\nquarks together in a hadron.\nEach quark is assumed to carry a color charge, analogous to electric charge,\nand the strong force between quarks is referred to as the color force. This theory\nof the strong force is called quantum chromodynamics (chroma = color in Greek),\nor QCD, to indicate that the force acts between color charges (and not between,\nsay, electric charges). The strong force between two hadrons is considered to\nbe a force between the quarks that make them up, as suggested in Fig. 32-17.\np\nn\nu\nd \\u\nd/\nd\nu (blue)\nd (red)\np\nn\nGluon\n80\nu/d\nd\nu ud\nu (red)\nn\np\nn\np\n(a)\nd (blue)\n(b)\n(c)\nFIGURE 32-17 (a) The force between two quarks holding them together as part of a proton, for\nexample, is carried by a gluon, which in this case involves a change in color.

(c) Quark representation of the same interaction\nn + p -> n + p. The blue coiled lines between quarks represent gluon exchanges holding the\nhadrons together. (The exchanged meson may be regarded as ud emitted by the n and absorbed by\nthe p, or as ud emitted by p and absorbed by n, because a u (or d) quark going to the left in the\ndiagram is equivalent to a u (or d) going to the right.)\nThe particles that transmit the color force (analogous to photons for the EM force)\nare called gluons (a play on "glue"). They are included in Tables 32-2 and 32-5.\nThere are eight gluons, according to the theory, all massless and all have color\ncharge.+\nYou might ask what would happen if we try to see a single quark with color\nby reaching deep inside a hadron and extracting a single quark. Quarks are so\ntightly bound to other quarks that extracting one would require a tremendous\namount of energy, so much that it would be sufficient to create more quarks\n(E = mc2). Indeed, such experiments are done at modern particle colliders and\nall we get is more hadrons (quark-antiquark pairs, or triplets, which we observe\nas mesons or baryons), never an isolated quark. This property of quarks, that\nthey are always bound in groups that are colorless, is called confinement.\nThe color force has the interesting property that, as two quarks approach\neach other very closely (equivalently, have high energy), the force between them\nbecomes small. This aspect is referred to as asymptotic freedom.\nThe weak force, as we have seen, is thought to be mediated by the W+, W",\nand Zº particles. It acts between the "weak charges" that each particle has. Each\nfundamental particle can thus have electric charge, weak charge, color charge, and\ngravitational mass, although one or more of these could be zero. For example, all\nleptons have color charge of zero, so they do not interact via the strong force.\n*Compare to the EM interaction, where the photon has no electric charge. Because gluons have color\ncharge, they could attract each other and form composite particles (photons cannot). Such "glueballs"\nare being searched for.\nSECTION 32-10 The Standard Model: QCD and Electroweak Theory 937\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 24, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'p\nudu\ne-\n12º\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 32-9\nBeta decay.

What happens, in part, is that a neutron (udd quarks)\ndecays into a proton (uud). Apparently a d quark (charge - ge) has turned\ninto a u quark (charge + 3e). Charge conservation means that a negatively\ncharged particle, namely a W", was emitted by the d quark. Since an electron\nand an antineutrino appear in the final state, they must have come from the\ndecay of the virtual W", as shown in Fig. 32-18.\nFIGURE 32-18 Quark representation\nof the Feynman diagram for ß decay of\na neutron into a proton. Example 32-9.\nTo summarize, the Standard Model says that the truly fundamental particles\n(Table 32-5) are the leptons, the quarks, the gauge bosons (photon, W and Z, and\nthe gluons), and the Higgs boson. The photon, leptons, W+, W", and Zº have all\nbeen observed in experiments. But only combinations of quarks (baryons and\nmesons) have been observed in the free state, and it seems likely that free quarks\nand gluons cannot be observed in isolation.\nOne important aspect of theoretical work is the attempt to find a unified\nbasis for the different forces in nature. This was a long-held hope of Einstein,\nwhich he was never able to fulfill. A so-called gauge theory that unifies the weak\nand electromagnetic interactions was put forward in the 1960s by S. Weinberg,\nS. Glashow, and A. Salam. In this electroweak theory, the weak and electro-\nmagnetic forces are seen as two different manifestations of a single, more\nfundamental, electroweak interaction. The electroweak theory has had many\nsuccesses, including the prediction of the W+ particles as carriers of the weak\nforce, with masses of 80.38 + 0.02 GeV/c2 in excellent agreement with the\nmeasured values of 80.385 + 0.015 GeV/c2 (and similar accuracy for the Zº).\nThe combination of electroweak theory plus QCD for the strong interaction\nis referred to today as the Standard Model (SM) of fundamental particles.\nEXAMPLE 32-10\nESTIMATE\nRange of weak force. The weak nuclear force\nis of very short range, meaning it acts over only a very short distance. Estimate\nits range using the masses (Table 32-2) of the W+ and Z: m ~ 80 or\n90 GeV/c2 ~ 102 GeV/c2.\nAPPROACH We assume the W+ or Zº exchange particles can exist for a\ntime At given by the uncertainty principle (Section 28-3), At ~ h/AE, where\nAE ~ mc2 is the energy needed to create the virtual particle (W+, Z) that\ncarries the weak force.\nSOLUTION Let Ax be the distance the virtual W or Z can move before it must\nbe reabsorbed within the time At ~ h/AE. To find an upper limit on Ax, and\nhence the maximum range of the weak force, we let the W or Z travel close to\nthe speed of light, so Ax ≤ c At. Recalling that 1 GeV = 1.6 × 10-10 J, then\n22\n(3 × 108 m/s)(10-34 J ·s)\n~ 10-18 m.\n22\n(102 GeV)(1.6 × 10-10 J/GeV)\nThis is indeed a very small range.\nNOTE Compare this to the range of the electromagnetic force whose range is\ninfinite (1/r2 never becomes zero for any finite r), which makes sense because\nthe mass of its virtual exchange particle, the photon, is zero (in the denominator\nof the above equation).\n[We did a similar calculation for the strong force in Section 32-2, estimating\nthe mass of the TT meson as exchange particle. In our deeper view of the strong\nforce, namely the color force between quarks within a nucleon, the gluons have\nzero mass, which implies infinite range (see formula in Example 32-10). We\nmight have expected a range of about 10-15 m (nuclear size). But according to the\nStandard Model, the color force is weak at very close distances and increases\ngreatly with distance (causing quark confinement). Thus its range could be infinite.]\n938 CHAPTER 32 Elementary Particles\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 25, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Theoreticians have wondered why the W and Z have large masses rather\nthan being massless like the photon. Peter Higgs and others in 1964 used elec-\ntroweak theory to suggest an explanation by means of a Higgs field and its\nparticle, the Higgs boson, which interact with the W and Z to "slow them down."\nIn being forced to go slower than the speed of light, they would have to have\nmass (m = 0 only if v = c). Indeed, the Higgs field is thought to permeate the\nvacuum ("empty space") and to perhaps confer mass on particles that now have\nmass by slowing them down. In 2012 strong evidence was announced at CERN\'s\nLarge Hadron Collider (Section 32-1) for a particle of mass 125 GeV/c2 that is\nthought to be the long-sought Higgs boson of the Standard Model. But intense\nresearch continues, not only to better understand this particle, but to search for\nadditional Higgs-like particles suggested by theories that go beyond the Standard\nModel such as supersymmetry (Section 32-12).\n1500 -\nHiggs\nNumber of interactions (arbitrary units)\n1000 +\n· Data\n- Fit\n--\n- Background\nFIGURE 32-19 Evidence for the\nHiggs boson.\n500 +\n0\n110\n120\n130\n140\n150\nMass (energy) in GeV/c2\nFigure 32-19 shows the "resonance" bump (Section 32-7) that represents the\nHiggs boson as detected by the CMS team at the LHC.

As can be seen in\nFig. 32-19, there are many more background events around 125 GeV than there\nare in the resonance bump representing the Higgs boson.\nFIGURE 32-20 Fabiola Gianotti,\nleader of the ATLAS team\n(3000 physicists), at the LHC with\ntheorist Peter Higgs, July 4, 2012,\nwhen the long hoped-for boson was\nannounced.\n32-11 Grand Unified Theories\nThe Standard Model, for all its success, cannot explain some important issues-\nsuch as why the charge on the electron has exactly the same magnitude as the\ncharge on the proton. This is crucial, because if the charge magnitudes were even\na little different, atoms would not be neutral and the resulting large electric\nforces would surely have made life impossible. Indeed, the Standard Model is\nnow considered to be a low-energy approximation to a more complete theory.\nWith the success of unified electroweak theory, theorists are trying to\nincorporate it and QCD for the strong (color) force into a so-called grand unified\ntheory (GUT).\nOne type of such a grand unified theory of the electromagnetic, weak, and\nstrong forces has been proposed in which there is only one class of particle-\nleptons and quarks belong to the same family and are able to change freely from\none type to the other-and the three forces are different aspects of a single\nunderlying force. The unity is predicted to occur, however, only on a scale of less\nthan about 10-31 m, corresponding to a typical particle energy of about 1016 GeV.\nSECTION 32-11 Grand Unified Theories 939\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 26, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 32-21 Symmetry around\na table. Example 32-11.\nIf two elementary particles (leptons or quarks) approach each other to within\nthis unification scale, the apparently fundamental distinction between them would\nnot exist at this level, and a quark could readily change to a lepton, or vice versa.\nBaryon and lepton numbers would not be conserved. The weak, electromagnetic,\nand strong (color) force would blend to a force of a single strength.\nWhat happens between the unification distance of 10-31 m and more normal\n(larger) distances is referred to as symmetry breaking. As an analogy, consider an\natom in a crystal. Deep within the atom, there is much symmetry-in the\ninnermost regions the electron cloud is spherically symmetric (Chapter 28).\nFarther out, this symmetry breaks down-the electron clouds are distributed\npreferentially along the lines (bonds) joining the atoms in the crystal. In a similar\nway, at 10-31 m the force between elementary particles is theorized to be a single\nforce-it is symmetrical and does not single out one type of "charge" over\nanother. But at larger distances, that symmetry is broken and we see three dis-\ntinct forces. (In the "Standard Model" of electroweak interactions, Section 32-10,\nthe symmetry breaking between the electromagnetic and the weak interactions\noccurs at about 10-18 m.)\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 32-11\nSymmetry. The table in Fig. 32-21 has\nfour identical place settings. Four people sit down to eat. Describe the symmetry\nof this table and what happens to it when someone starts the meal.\nRESPONSE The table has several kinds of symmetry. It is symmetric to\nrotations of 90°: that is, the table will look the same if everyone moved one\nchair to the left or to the right. It is also north-south symmetric and east-west\nsymmetric, so that swaps across the table don\'t affect the way the table looks. It\nalso doesn\'t matter whether any person picks up the fork to the left of the plate\nor the fork to the right. But once that first person picks up either fork, the\nchoice is set for all the rest at the table as well. The symmetry has been broken.\nThe underlying symmetry is still there-the blue glasses could still be chosen\neither way-but some choice must get made and at that moment the symmetry\nof the diners is broken.\nAnother example of symmetry breaking is a pencil standing on its point\nbefore falling. Standing, it looks the same from any horizontal direction. From\nabove, it is a tiny circle. But when it falls to the table, it points in one particular\ndirection-the symmetry is broken.\nProton Decay\nSince unification is thought to occur at such tiny distances and huge energies, the\ntheory is difficult to test experimentally. But it is not completely impossible. One\ntestable prediction is the idea that the proton might decay (via, for example,\np -> TTº + e+) and violate conservation of baryon number. This could happen if\ntwo quarks within a proton approached to within 10-31 m of each other. But it is\nvery unlikely at normal temperature and energy, so the decay of a proton can\nonly be an unlikely process. In the simplest form of GUT, the theoretical esti-\nmate of the proton mean life for the decay mode p -> Tr0 + e+ is about 1031 yr,\nand this is now within the realm of testability.+ Proton decays have still not been\nseen, and experiments put the lower limit on the proton mean life for the above\nmode to be about 1033 yr, somewhat greater than this prediction. This may seem\na disappointment, but on the other hand, it presents a challenge. Indeed more\ncomplex GUTs may resolve this conflict.\n*This is much larger than the age of the universe (~ 14 × 109 yr). But we don\'t have to wait 1031 yr to\nsee. Instead we can wait for one decay among 1031 protons over a year (see Eqs. 30-3a and 30-7,\nAN = AN At = N At/T, and Example 32-12).\n940 CHAPTER 32 Elementary Particles\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 27, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 32-12 |ESTIMATE\nProton decay.

If the experi-\nment is run for 4 years without detecting a decay, estimate the lower limit on the\nproton mean life.\nAPPROACH As with radioactive decay, the number of decays is proportional\nto the number of parent species (N), the time interval (At), and the decay\nconstant (A) which is related to the mean life 7 by (see Eqs. 30-3 and 30-7):\nAN = - AN At\n- N At.\nN At\nSOLUTION Dealing only with magnitudes, we solve for T:\nT = NAT.\nThus for AN < 1 (we don\'t see even one decay) over the four-year trial,\nT > N (4 yr),\nwhere N is the number of protons in 3300 tons of water. To determine N, we note\nthat each molecule of H2O contains 2 + 8 = 10 protons. So one mole of water\n(18 g, 6 × 1023 molecules) contains 10 × 6 × 1023 = 6×1024 protons in 18 g of\nwater (= 18 g/1000 g = 1/56 of a kg), or about 3 × 1026 protons per kilogram. One\nton is 103 kg, so the 3300 tons contains (3.3 × 106 kg)(3 × 1026 protons/kg) ~\n1 × 1033 protons. Then our very rough estimate for a lower limit on the proton\nmean life is T > (1033)(4 yr) ~ 4 × 1033 yr.\n* GUT and Cosmology\nAn interesting prediction of unified theories relates to cosmology (Chapter 33).\nIt was thought by many theorists that during the first 10-35 s after the theorized\nBig Bang that created the universe, the temperature was so extremely high that\nparticles had energies corresponding to the unification scale. Baryon number\nwould not have been conserved then, perhaps allowing an imbalance that might\naccount for the observed predominance of matter (B > 0) over antimatter\n(B < 0) in the universe. The fact that we are surrounded by matter, with no sig-\nnificant antimatter in sight, is considered a problem in search of an explanation\n(not given by the Standard Model). We call this the matter-antimatter problem.\nTo understand it may require still undiscovered phenomena-perhaps related to\nquarks or neutrinos, or the Higgs boson or supersymmetry (next Section).\nMany theorists no longer think the Big Bang was sufficiently hot to create\nunification. Nonetheless we see that there is a deep connection between\ninvestigations at either end of the size scale: theories about the tiniest objects\n(elementary particles) have a strong bearing on the understanding of the\nuniverse on a large scale. We look at this more in the next Chapter.\nFigure 32-22 is a rough diagram indicating how the four fundamental forces\nin nature might have "condensed out" (a symmetry was broken) as time went on\nafter the Big Bang (Chapter 33), and as the mean temperature of the universe\nand the typical particle energy decreased.\nGrand\nUnification\nGUT\nPlanck\nFIGURE 32-22 Time and energy\nplot of the four fundamental forces,\nperhaps unified at the "Planck time"\n(10-43 s after the birth of the universe),\nWeak\nand how each condensed out,\nassuming a very hot Big Bang.

(Such\ntheories are sometimes referred to misleadingly as theories of everything.) A major\nattempt to unify all four forces is called string theory, introduced by Gabriele\nVeneziano in 1968: Each fundamental particle (Table 32-5) is imagined not as a\npoint but as a one-dimensional string, perhaps 10-35 m long, which vibrates in a\nparticular standing wave pattern. (You might say each particle is a different note\non a tiny stretched string.) More sophisticated theories propose the fundamental\nentities as being multidimensional branes (after 2-D membranes).\nA related idea that also goes way beyond the Standard Model is supersymmetry,\nwhich applied to strings is known as superstring theory. Supersymmetry,\ndeveloped by Bruno Zumino (1923-) and Julius Wess (1934-2007), predicts that\ninteractions exist that would change fermions into bosons and vice versa, and\nthat each known fermion would have a supersymmetric boson partner. Thus, for\neach quark (a fermion), there would be a squark (a boson) or "supersymmetric"\nquark. For every lepton there would be a slepton. Likewise, for every known\nboson (photons and gluons, for example), there would be a supersymmetric\nfermion (photinos and gluinos). Supersymmetry predicts also that a graviton,\nwhich transmits the gravity force, has a partner, the gravitino. Supersymmetry\n(often abbreviated SUSY) offers solutions to a number of important theoretical\nproblems. Supersymmetric particles are a candidate for the "dark matter" of the\nuniverse (discussed in Chapter 33). But why hasn\'t this "missing part" of the\nuniverse ever been detected? The best guess is that supersymmetric particles\nmight be heavier than their conventional counterparts, perhaps too heavy to have\nbeen produced in today\'s accelerators. A search for supersymmetric particles\nis already being done at CERN\'s new Large Hadron Collider.\nVersions of these theories predict other interesting properties, such as that\nspace has 11 dimensions, but 7 of them are "coiled up" so we normally only notice\nthe 4-D of space-time. We would like to know if and how many extra dimensions\nthere are, and how and why they are hidden. We hope to have some answers from\nthe new LHC (Section 32-1).\nSome theorists think SUSY and other theories are approximations to a more\nfundamental, still undiscovered, M-theory. Edward Witten coined the term\nwhen proposing an 11 dimensional approximation, but never said what "M"\nstands for.\nThe world of elementary particles is opening new vistas. What happens in the\nfuture is bound to be exciting.\nSummary\nParticle accelerators are used to accelerate charged particles,\nsuch as electrons and protons, so they can have very high\nenergy collisions with other particles. High-energy particles\nhave short wavelength and so can be used to probe the structure\nof matter in great detail (very small distances). High kinetic\nenergy also allows the creation of new particles through colli-\nsions (via E = mc2).\nCyclotrons and synchrotrons use a magnetic field to keep\nthe particles in a circular path and accelerate them at intervals\nby high voltage. Linear accelerators accelerate particles along\na line. Colliding beams allow higher interaction energy.\nAn antiparticle has the same mass as a particle but opposite\ncharge. Certain other properties may also be opposite: for\nexample, the antiproton has baryon number (nucleon number)\nopposite (B = - 1) to that for the proton (B = +1).\nIn all nuclear and particle reactions, the following conser-\nvation laws hold: momentum, angular momentum, mass-energy,\nelectric charge, baryon number, and lepton numbers.\nCertain particles have a property called strangeness,\nwhich is conserved by the strong force but not by the weak\nforce. The properties charm, bottom, and top also are con-\nserved by the strong force but not by the weak force.\n942 CHAPTER 32 Elementary Particles\n', 'chapter_title': '32-2 Beginnings of Elementary Particle Physics-Particle Exchange'}, {'page_number': 29, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Just as the electromagnetic force can be said to be due to\nan exchange of photons, the strong nuclear force is carried by\nmassless gluons.
