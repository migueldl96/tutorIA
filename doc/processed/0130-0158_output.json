We also discuss how Newton conceived of another great law\nby applying the concepts of circular motion to the motion of the Moon and the\nplanets. This is the law of universal gravitation, which was the capstone of Newton\'s\nanalysis of the physical world.\nv\n1\n1\n5-1 Kinematics of\nUniform Circular Motion\nV2\nFIGURE 5-1 A small object\nmoving in a circle, showing how\nthe velocity changes. At each point,\nthe instantaneous velocity is in a\ndirection tangent to the circular\npath.\nFIGURE 5-2 Determining the\nchange in velocity, Av, for a particle\nmoving in a circle. The length Al is\nthe distance along the arc, from\nA to B.\nB\nv\n1\nA\nB\nB\nv\n2\nr\nr\nC\nV1\nAn object that moves in a circle at constant speed v is said to experience\nuniform circular motion. The magnitude of the velocity remains constant in this\ncase, but the direction of the velocity continuously changes as the object moves\naround the circle (Fig. 5-1). Because acceleration is defined as the rate of change\nof velocity, a change in direction of velocity is an acceleration, just as a change in\nits magnitude is. Thus, an object revolving in a circle is continuously accelerating,\neven when the speed remains constant (v1 = 22 = v in Fig. 5-1). We now investi-\ngate this acceleration quantitatively.\nAcceleration is defined as\nB\nB\nB\nv\n=\nAt\n153\n=\n1\n,\nwhere Av is the change in velocity during the short time interval At. We will\neventually consider the situation in which At approaches zero and thus obtain\nthe instantaneous acceleration. But for purposes of making a clear drawing,\nFig. 5-2, we consider a nonzero time interval. During the time interval At, the\nparticle in Fig. 5-2a moves from point A to point B, covering a distance Al\nalong the arc which subtends an angle 40. The change in the velocity vector is\nV2 - V1 = Av, and is shown in Fig. 5-2b (note that V2 = V1 + Av).\nNow we let At be very small, approaching zero. Then Al and 40 are also\nvery small, and v2 will be almost parallel to v1, Fig. 5-2c; Av will be essentially\nperpendicular to them. Thus Av points toward the center of the circle. Since ã,\nby definition, is in the same direction as Av (equation above), it too must point\ntoward the center of the circle. Therefore, this acceleration is called centripetal\nacceleration ("center-pointing" acceleration) or radial acceleration (since it is\ndirected along the radius, toward the center of the circle), and we denote it by äR .\n(a)\nNow that we have determined the direction, next we find the magnitude of the\nradial (centripetal) acceleration, aR . Because the line CA in Fig. 5-2a is perpen-\ndicular to v1, and line CB is perpendicular to v2, then the angle 40 between CA and\nCB is also the angle between v1 and v2. Hence the vectors V1, V2, and Av in\nFig. 5-2b form a triangle that is geometrically similar to triangle ACB in Fig. 5-2a.\nIf we take 40 to be very small (letting At be very small) and set v = V1 = U2\nbecause the magnitude of the velocity is assumed not to change, we can write\nV2\n(b)\nΔΘ\nAv = V2- V1\nB\nAD ~ Al .\na = lim Av\nAt->0 At\nr\nr\nThis is an exact equality when At approaches zero, for then the arc length Al equals\nthe chord length AB. We want to find the instantaneous acceleration, so we let At\napproach zero, write the above expression as an equality, and then solve for Av:\nV2\nAv = 2 se.\n[At -> 0]\nC\n(c)\nTo get the centripetal acceleration, aR , we divide Av by At:\naR = A = C A\nr At\n[At -> 0]\nBut Al/At is the linear speed, v, of the object, so the radial (centripetal)\n+Appendix A contains a review of geometry.\n110 CHAPTER 5 Circular Motion; Gravitation\n', 'chapter_title': '5-1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'r\n[radial (centripetal) acceleration] (5-1)\nacceleration is\n22\nAR = 22\n.\n[Equation 5-1 is valid at any instant in circular motion, and even when v is not\nconstant.]\nTo summarize, an object moving in a circle of radius r at constant speed v has\nan acceleration whose direction is toward the center of the circle and whose magni-\ntude is aR = v2/r. It is not surprising that this acceleration depends on v and r.\nThe greater the speed v, the faster the velocity changes direction; and the larger the\nradius, the less rapidly the velocity changes direction.\nThe acceleration vector points toward the center of the circle when v is con-\nstant. But the velocity vector always points in the direction of motion, which is\ntangential to the circle. Thus the velocity and acceleration vectors are perpen-\ndicular to each other at every point in the path for uniform circular motion\n(Fig. 5-3). This is another example that illustrates the error in thinking that\nacceleration and velocity are always in the same direction. For an object falling\nin a vertical path, a and v are indeed parallel. But in uniform circular motion, a and v\nare perpendicular, not parallel (nor were they parallel in projectile motion,\nSection 3-5).\nCircular motion is often described in terms of the frequency f, the number of\nrevolutions per second. The period T of an object revolving in a circle is the time\nrequired for one complete revolution. Period and frequency are related by\nT = 1.\n(5-2)\nCAUTION\nIn uniform circular motion, the speed is\nconstant, but the acceleration is not zero\nCAUTION\nThe direction of motion (v) and\nthe acceleration (a) are not in\nthe same direction; instead, å L v\nV2\na2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nB\nFor example, if an object revolves at a frequency of 3 rev/s, then each revolution\n(= rev) takes 3 s.

A 150-g ball at the end of\na string is revolving uniformly in a horizontal circle of radius 0.600 m, as\nin Fig. 5-1 or 5-3. The ball makes 2.00 revolutions in a second. What is its\ncentripetal acceleration?\nAPPROACH The centripetal acceleration is aR = v2/r. We are given r, and we\ncan find the speed of the ball, v, from the given radius and frequency.\nSOLUTION If the ball makes 2.00 complete revolutions per second, then the\nball travels in a complete circle in a time interval equal to 0.500 s, which is its\nperiod T. The distance traveled in this time is the circumference of the circle,\n2Tr, where r is the radius of the circle. Therefore, the ball has speed\nv = 2T =\nT\n(0.500 s)\n2TT(0.600 m)\n=\n7.54 m/s.\nThe centripetal acceleration+ is\nv2\nap =\nr\n(0.600 m)\n=\n(7.54 m/s)2\n94.7 m/s2.\nEXERCISE A In Example 5-1, if the radius is doubled to 1.20 m, but the period stays\nthe same, the centripetal acceleration will change by a factor of:\n(a) 2;(b)4; (c);(d);(e) none of these.\n+Differences in the final digit can depend on whether you keep all digits in your calculator for v\n(which gives aR = 94.7 m/s2), or if you use v = 7.54 m/s (which gives aR = 94.8 m/s2). Both results\nare valid since our assumed accuracy is about + 0.1 m/s (see Section 1-4).\nSECTION 5-1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion 111\n', 'chapter_title': '5-1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CAUTION\nDistinguish the Moon\'s\ngravity on objects at its surface\nfrom the Earth\'s gravity acting\non the Moon (this Example)\nB\nF\nB\nEXAMPLE 5-2\nMoon\'s centripetal acceleration.

Determine the acceleration of the Moon toward the Earth.\nAPPROACH Again we need to find the velocity v in order to find aR .\nSOLUTION In one orbit around the Earth, the Moon travels a distance 2Tr,\nwhere r = 3.84 × 108 m is the radius of its circular path. The time required\nfor one complete orbit is the Moon\'s period of 27.3 d. The speed of the Moon\nin its orbit about the Earth is v = 2Tr/T. The period T in seconds is\nT = (27.3 d)(24.0 h/d)(3600 s/h) = 2.36 × 106 s.

Rather, it is the acceleration due to the Earth\'s gravity for any object\n(such as the Moon) that is 384,000 km from the Earth. Notice how small this\nacceleration is compared to the acceleration of objects near the Earth\'s surface.\n5-2 Dynamics of\nUniform Circular Motion\nAccording to Newton\'s second law (2F = ma), an object that is accelerating\nmust have a net force acting on it. An object moving in a circle, such as a ball on\nthe end of a string, must therefore have a force applied to it to keep it moving in\nthat circle. That is, a net force is necessary to give it centripetal acceleration. The\nmagnitude of the required force can be calculated using Newton\'s second law for\nthe radial component, 2FR = maR, where aR is the centripetal acceleration,\n@R = v2/r, and ≥FR is the total (or net) force in the radial direction:\n1>\nB\nFIGURE 5-4 A force is required to\nkeep an object moving in a circle. If\nthe speed is constant, the force is\ndirected toward the circle\'s center.\nCAUTION\nCentripetal force is not a new\nkind of force\n(Every force must be exerted\nby an object)\nEFR = max = m2.\n[circular motion] (5-3)\nFor uniform circular motion (v = constant), the acceleration is aR, which is\ndirected toward the center of the circle at all times. Thus the net force too must\nbe directed toward the center of the circle (Fig. 5-4). A net force is necessary\nbecause if no net force were exerted on the object, it would not move in a circle\nbut in a straight line, as Newton\'s first law tells us. The direction of the net force\nis continually changing so that it is always directed toward the center of the circle.\nThis force is sometimes called a centripetal ("pointing toward the center") force.\nBut be aware that "centripetal force" does not indicate some new kind of force.\nThe term "centripetal force" merely describes the direction of the net force needed\nto provide a circular path: the net force is directed toward the circle\'s center. The\nforce must be applied by other objects. For example, to swing a ball in a circle on\nthe end of a string, you pull on the string and the string exerts the force on the\nball. (Try it.) Here, the "centripetal force" that provides the centripetal accelera-\ntion is tension in the string. In other cases it can be gravity (on the Moon, for example),\na normal force, or even an electric force.\n112 CHAPTER 5 Circular Motion; Gravitation\n', 'chapter_title': '5-1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CAUTION\nThere is no real "centrifugal force"\nThere is a common misconception that an object moving in a circle has an\noutward force acting on it, a so-called centrifugal ("center-fleeing") force. This is\nincorrect: there is no outward force on the revolving object. Consider, for example,\na person swinging a ball on the end of a string around her head (Fig. 5-5). If you\nhave ever done this yourself, you know that you feel a force pulling outward on\nyour hand. The misconception arises when this pull is interpreted as an outward\n"centrifugal" force pulling on the ball that is transmitted along the string to your\nhand. This is not what is happening at all. To keep the ball moving in a circle, you\npull inwardly on the string, and the string exerts this inward force on the ball. The ball\nexerts an equal and opposite force on the string (Newton\'s third law), and this\nis the outward force your hand feels (see Fig. 5-5).\nThe force on the ball in Fig. 5-5 is the one exerted inwardly on it by you, via the\nstring. To see even more convincing evidence that a "centrifugal force" does not act\non the ball, consider what happens when you let go of the string. If a centrifugal force\nwere acting, the ball would fly outward, as shown in Fig. 5-6a. But it doesn\'t;\nthe ball flies off tangentially (Fig. 5-6b), in the direction of the velocity it had\nat the moment it was released, because the inward force no longer acts. Try it\nand see!\nEXERCISE B Return to Chapter-Opening Question 1, page 109, and answer it again\nnow.

In\nfact, it flies off tangentially as in (b).\nIn (c) sparks fly in straight lines\ntangentially from the edge of a\nrotating grinding wheel.\nEXAMPLE 5-3 |ESTIMATE\nForce on revolving ball (horizontal). Estimate\nthe force a person must exert on a string attached to a 0.150-kg ball to make the\nball revolve in a horizontal circle of radius 0.600 m. The ball makes 2.00 revo-\nlutions per second (T = 0.500 s), as in Example 5-1. Ignore the string\'s mass.\nAPPROACH First we need to draw the free-body diagram for the ball. The forces\nacting on the ball are the force of gravity, mg downward, and the tension force FT\nthat the string exerts toward the hand at the center (which occurs because the\nperson exerts that same force on the string). The free-body diagram for the ball is\nshown in Fig. 5-7. The ball\'s weight complicates matters and makes it impos-\nsible to revolve a ball with the cord perfectly horizontal. We estimate the force\nassuming the weight is small, and letting ø ~ 0 in Fig. 5-7. Then FT will act\nnearly horizontally and, in any case, provides the force necessary to give the ball\nits centripetal acceleration.\nSOLUTION We apply Newton\'s second law to the radial direction, which we\nassume is horizontal:\n(ZF)R = mar ,\nwhere aR = v2/r and v=2mr/T= 21(0.600m)/(0.500 s) = 7.54 m/s.

(b) Calculate the tension in the cord at the bottom\nof the arc, assuming the ball is moving at twice the speed of part (a).\nAPPROACH The ball moves in a vertical circle and is not undergoing uniform\ncircular motion. The radius is assumed constant, but the speed v changes\nbecause of gravity. Nonetheless, Eq. 5-1 (aR = v2/r) is valid at each point along\nthe circle, and we use it at the top and bottom points. The free-body diagram is\nshown in Fig. 5-8 for both positions.\nSOLUTION (a) At the top (point 1), two forces act on the ball: mg, the force of\ngravity, and FT1, the tension force the cord exerts at point 1. Both act down-\nward, and their vector sum acts to give the ball its centripetal acceleration aR .\nWe apply Newton's second law, for the vertical direction, choosing downward as\npositive since the acceleration is downward (toward the center):\n(EF)R = maR\nFr1 + mg = m\nr\n5%\n.\n[at top]\nFrom this equation we can see that the tension force Fr1 at point 1 will get larger\nif v1 (ball's speed at top of circle) is made larger, as expected. But we are asked\nfor the minimum speed to keep the ball moving in a circle. The cord will remain\ntaut as long as there is tension in it. But if the tension disappears (because v1 is\ntoo small) the cord can go limp, and the ball will fall out of its circular path. Thus,\nthe minimum speed will occur if Fr1 = 0 (the ball at the topmost point), for\nwhich the equation above becomes\nmg = mo,.\n[minimum speed at top]\nWe solve for v1 , keeping an extra digit for use in (b):\nV1 = Vgr = \\(9.80 m/s2)(1.10 m)\n= 3.283 m/s ~ 3.28 m/s.\nThis is the minimum speed at the top of the circle if the ball is to continue\nmoving in a circular path.\n(b) When the ball is at the bottom of the circle (point 2 in Fig. 5-8), the cord\nexerts its tension force Fr2 upward, whereas the force of gravity, mg, still acts\ndownward. Choosing upward as positive, Newton's second law gives:\n(EF)R = maR\nFT2 - mg = m\n02.\nr\n[at bottom]\nThe speed v2 is given as twice that in (a), namely 6.566 m/s.

In such a situation, you may feel that you are thrust outward toward\nthe right side door. But there is no mysterious centrifugal force pulling on you.\nWhat is happening is that you tend to move in a straight line, whereas the car has\nbegun to follow a curved path. To make you go in the curved path, the seat\n(friction) or the door of the car (direct contact) exerts a force on you (Fig. 5-11).\nThe car also must have a force exerted on it toward the center of the curve if it\nis to move in that curve.

So the\nfriction force the road exerts on the tires is static friction. But if static friction\nis not great enough, as under icy conditions or high speed, the static friction\nforce is less than mv2/r and the car will skid out of a circular path into a more\nnearly straight path. See Fig. 5-12. Once a car skids or slides, the friction force\nbecomes kinetic friction, which is smaller than static friction.\nEXAMPLE 5-6\nSkidding on a curve. A 1000-kg car rounds a curve on a\nflat road of radius 50 m at a speed of 15 m/s (54 km/h). Will the car follow the\ncurve, or will it skid? Assume: (a) the pavement is dry and the coefficient of static\nfriction is ps = 0.60; (b) the pavement is icy and us = 0.25.\nAPPROACH The forces on the car are gravity mg downward, the normal\nforce FN exerted upward by the road, and a horizontal friction force due to the\nroad. They are shown in Fig. 5-13, which is the free-body diagram for the car.\nThe car will follow the curve if the maximum static friction force is greater than\nthe mass times the centripetal acceleration.\nSOLUTION In the vertical direction (y) there is no acceleration. Newton's second\nlaw tells us that the normal force FN on the car is equal to the weight mg since\nthe road is flat:\n0 = >Fy = FN - mg\nSO\nFN = mg = (1000 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 9800 N.\nIn the horizontal direction the only force is friction, and we must compare it to\nthe force needed to produce the centripetal acceleration to see if it is sufficient.\nThe net horizontal force required to keep the car moving in a circle around the\ncurve is\n(EF)R = maR =\naR = m o2 = (10\n(50 m)\n(1000 kg)\n(15 m/s)2\n= 4500 N.\nNow we compute the maximum total static friction force (the sum of the friction\nforces acting on each of the four tires) to see if it can be large enough to provide\na safe centripetal acceleration. For (a), Ms = 0.60, and the maximum friction\nforce attainable (recall from Section 4-8 that Ffr ≤ ps FN) is\n(Ffr)max\nnax = @sFN = (0.60)(9800 N) = 5880 N.\nSince a force of only 4500 N is needed, and that is, in fact, how much will be\nexerted by the road as a static friction force, the car can follow the curve. But in\n(b) the maximum static friction force possible is\n(Ffr)max = psFN = (0.25)(9800 N) = 2450 N.\nThe car will skid because the ground cannot exert sufficient force (4500 N is\nneeded) to keep it moving in a curve of radius 50 m at a speed of 54 km/h.\nThe possibility of skidding is worse if the wheels lock (stop rotating) when the\nbrakes are applied too hard. When the tires are rolling, static friction exists. But\nif the wheels lock (stop rotating), the tires slide and the friction force, which is\nnow kinetic friction, is less. More importantly, the direction of the friction force\nchanges suddenly if the wheels lock. Static friction can point perpendicular to the\nvelocity, as in Fig. 5-13b; but if the car slides, kinetic friction points opposite to\nthe velocity. The force no longer points toward the center of the circle, and the car\ncannot continue in a curved path (see Fig. 5-12). Even worse, if the road is wet\nor icy, locking of the wheels occurs with less force on the brake pedal since there\nis less road friction to keep the wheels turning rather than sliding. Antilock brakes\n(ABS) are designed to limit brake pressure just before the point where sliding\nwould occur, by means of delicate sensors and a fast computer.\n116 CHAPTER 5 Circular Motion; Gravitation\n", 'chapter_title': '5-1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXERCISE D To negotiate a flat (unbanked) curve at a faster speed, a driver puts a couple\nof sand bags in his van aiming to increase the force of friction between the tires and the\nroad. Will the sand bags help?\nThe banking of curves can reduce the chance of skidding. The normal force\nexerted by a banked road, acting perpendicular to the road, will have a compo-\nnent toward the center of the circle (Fig. 5-14), thus reducing the reliance on\nfriction. For a given banking angle 0, there will be one speed for which no friction\nat all is required. This will be the case when the horizontal component of the\nnormal force toward the center of the curve, FN sin 0 (see Fig. 5-14), is just\nequal to the force required to give a vehicle its centripetal acceleration-that is,\nwhen\nFN sin e = m 2 .\n[no friction required]\nThe banking angle of a road, 0, is chosen so that this condition holds for a partic-\nular speed, called the "design speed."\nEXAMPLE 5-7\nBanking angle.

(b) What is this angle for a road which\nhas a curve of radius 50 m with a design speed of 50 km/h?\nAPPROACH Even though the road is banked, the car is still moving along a\nhorizontal circle, so the centripetal acceleration needs to be horizontal. We\nchoose our x and y axes as horizontal and vertical so that aR, which is hori-\nzontal, is along the x axis. The forces on the car are the Earth\'s gravity mg\ndownward, and the normal force FN exerted by the road perpendicular to its\nsurface. See Fig. 5-14, where the components of FN are also shown. We don\'t\nneed to consider the friction of the road because we are designing a road to be\nbanked so as to eliminate dependence on friction.\nSOLUTION (a) Since there is no vertical motion, dy = 0 and ≥Fy = may gives\nFN COS 0 - mg = 0\nor\nFN =\nmg\n.\ncos 0\n[Note in this case that FN > mg because cos 0 ≤ 1.]\nWe substitute this relation for FN into the equation for the horizontal motion,\n22\nFN sin 0 = m-\n-,\nr\nwhich becomes\nmg\nsin 0 = m -\ncos 0\nr\nor\n02\n22\ntan 0\n=\nrg\n.\nThis is the formula for the banking angle 0: no friction needed at this speed v.\n(b) For r = 50 m and v = 50km/h (= 14m/s),\ntan 0 =\n(50 m)(9.8 m/s2)\n(14 m/s)2\n= 0.40,\nso 0 = tan-1(0.40) = 22°.\nWe have been using the centripetal acceleration a = v2/r where r is the\nradius of a circle.

If the net force is not directed toward the\ncenter but is at an angle, as shown in Fig. 5-15a, the force has two components.\nThe component directed toward the center of the circle, FR , gives rise to the cen-\ntripetal acceleration, äR, and keeps the object moving in a circle. The component\ntangent to the circle, Ftan , acts to increase (or decrease) the speed, and thus gives\nrise to a component of the acceleration tangent to the circle, atan · When the speed\nof the object is changing, a tangential component of force is acting.\nWhen you first start revolving a ball on the end of a string around your head,\nyou must give it tangential acceleration. You do this by pulling on the string with\nyour hand displaced from the center of the circle. In athletics, a hammer thrower\naccelerates the hammer tangentially in a similar way so that it reaches a high speed\nbefore release.\nThe tangential component of the acceleration, atan , has magnitude equal to\nthe rate of change of the magnitude of the object's velocity:\natan =\nAv\n.\nAt\nThe radial (centripetal) acceleration arises from the change in direction of the\nvelocity and, as we have seen (Eq. 5-1), has magnitude\naR = 2.\nv2\nThe tangential acceleration always points in a direction tangent to the circle, and\nis in the direction of motion (parallel to v, which is always tangent to the circle)\nif the speed is increasing, as shown in Fig. 5-15b.

In either case, ätan and är are always perpendicular\nto each other; and their directions change continually as the object moves along\nits circular path.

In particular, he wondered about the nature of the\nforce that must act to keep the Moon in its nearly circular orbit around the Earth.\nNewton was also thinking about the problem of gravity. Since falling objects\naccelerate, Newton had concluded that they must have a force exerted on them,\na force we call the force of gravity. Whenever an object has a force exerted on it,\nthat force is exerted by some other object. But what exerts the force of gravity?\nEvery object on the surface of the Earth feels the force of gravity FG, and no\nmatter where the object is, the force is directed toward the center of the Earth\n(Fig. 5-16). Newton concluded that it must be the Earth itself that exerts the\ngravitational force on objects at its surface.\nAccording to legend, Newton noticed an apple drop from a tree. He is said to\nhave been struck with a sudden inspiration: If gravity acts at the tops of trees, and\neven at the tops of mountains, then perhaps it acts all the way to the Moon! With\nthis idea that it is the Earth\'s gravity that holds the Moon in its orbit, Newton\ndeveloped his great theory of gravitation. But there was controversy at the time.\nMany thinkers had trouble accepting the idea of a force "acting at a distance."\nTypical forces act through contact-your hand pushes a cart and pulls a wagon,\na bat hits a ball, and so on. But gravity acts without contact, said Newton: the Earth\nexerts a force on a falling apple and on the Moon, even though there is no contact,\nand the two objects may even be very far apart.+\nNewton set about determining the magnitude of the gravitational force that\nthe Earth exerts on the Moon as compared to the gravitational force on objects\nat the Earth\'s surface. The centripetal acceleration of the Moon, as we calculated\nin Example 5-2, is aR = 0.00272 m/s2. In terms of the acceleration of gravity at\nthe Earth\'s surface, g = 9.80 m/s2,\n0.00272 m/s2\ng\n3600\ng.\n1\naR =\n9.80 m/s2\nThat is, the acceleration of the Moon toward the Earth is about 3600 as great as\nthe acceleration of objects at the Earth\'s surface. The Moon is 384,000 km from\nthe Earth, which is about 60 times the Earth\'s radius of 6380 km. That is, the\nMoon is 60 times farther from the Earth\'s center than are objects at the Earth\'s\nsurface. But 60 × 60 = 602 = 3600. Again that number 3600! Newton concluded\nthat the gravitational force Fgrav or FG exerted by the Earth on any object decreases\nwith the square of its distance r from the Earth\'s center:\nFc x 1.\nThe Moon is 60 Earth radii away, so it feels a gravitational force only 1\n1\ntimes as strong as it would if it were at a point on the Earth\'s surface.\n3600\nNewton realized that the force of gravity on an object depends not only on\ndistance but also on the object\'s mass. In fact, it is directly proportional to its\nmass, as we have seen (Eq. 4-3). According to Newton\'s third law, when the Earth\nexerts its gravitational force on any object, such as the Moon, that object exerts an\nequal and opposite force on the Earth (Fig. 5-17). Because of this symmetry,\nNewton reasoned, the magnitude of the force of gravity must be proportional to\nboth masses:\nFG X\nmEmObj\nr2\n,\nwhere mE and mObj are the masses of the Earth and the other object, respectively,\nand r is the distance from the Earth\'s center to the center of the other object.\n*To deal with the conceptual difficulty of "action at a distance," the idea of a gravitational field was intro-\nduced many years later: every object that has mass produces a gravitational field in space. The force\none object exerts on a second object is then due to the gravitational field produced by the first object at\nthe position of the second object. We discuss fields in Section 16-7.\nFG\nFG\nFG\nFIGURE 5-16 Anywhere on Earth,\nwhether in Alaska, Peru, or\nAustralia, the force of gravity acts\ndownward toward the Earth\'s center.\nFIGURE 5-17 The gravitational\nforce one object exerts on a second\nobject is directed toward the first\nobject; and, by Newton\'s third law,\nis equal and opposite to the force\nexerted by the second object on the\nfirst.

Two spheres\nare attached to a light horizontal rod,\nwhich is suspended at its center by a\nthin fiber. When a third sphere\n(labeled A) is brought close to one of\nthe suspended spheres (labeled B),\nthe gravitational force causes the\nlatter to move, and this twists the\nfiber slightly. The tiny movement is\nmagnified by the use of a narrow light\nbeam directed at a mirror mounted on\nthe fiber. The beam reflects onto a\nscale. Previous determination of how\nlarge a force will twist the fiber a\ngiven amount then allows the\nexperimenter to determine the\nmagnitude of the gravitational force\nbetween the two objects, A and B.\nNewton went a step further in his analysis of gravity. In his examination of the\norbits of the planets, he concluded that the force required to hold the different\nplanets in their orbits around the Sun seems to diminish as the inverse square of\ntheir distance from the Sun. This led him to believe that it is also the gravitational\nforce that acts between the Sun and each of the planets to keep them in their orbits.\nAnd if gravity acts between these objects, why not between all objects? Thus he\nproposed his law of universal gravitation, which we can state as follows:\nEvery particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that\nis proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to\nthe square of the distance between them. This force acts along the line\njoining the two particles.\nThe magnitude of the gravitational force can be written as\nFG = G-\nr2\nm1m2,\n(5-4)\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the two particles, r is the distance between\nthem, and G is a universal constant which must be measured experimentally.\nThe value of G must be very small, since we are not aware of any force of\nattraction between ordinary-sized objects, such as between two baseballs. The\nforce between two ordinary objects was first measured by Henry Cavendish in\n1798, over 100 years after Newton published his law. To detect and measure the\nincredibly small force between ordinary objects, he used an apparatus like that\nshown in Fig. 5-18. Cavendish confirmed Newton's hypothesis that two objects\nattract one another and that Eq. 5-4 accurately describes this force. In addition,\nbecause Cavendish could measure FG, m1, m2, and r accurately, he was able to\ndetermine the value of the constant G as well. The accepted value today is\nG = 6.67 × 10-11 N · m2/kg2.\n(See Table inside front cover for values of all constants to highest known precision.)\nEquation 5-4 is called an inverse square law because the force is inversely propor-\ntional to r2.\n[Strictly speaking, Eq. 5-4 gives the magnitude of the gravitational force that\none particle exerts on a second particle that is a distance r away. For an extended\nobject (that is, not a point), we must consider how to measure the distance r.\nA correct calculation treats each extended body as a collection of particles, and\nthe total force is the sum of the forces due to all the particles. The sum over all these\nparticles is often done using integral calculus, which Newton himself invented.\nWhen extended bodies are small compared to the distance between them (as for the\nEarth-Sun system), little inaccuracy results from considering them as point particles.\nNewton was able to show that the gravitational force exerted on a particle outside a\nuniform sphere is the same as if the entire mass of the sphere was concentrated at its\ncenter .* Thus Eq. 5-4 gives the correct force between two uniform spheres where r\nis the distance between their centers.]\nEXAMPLE 5-9\nESTIMATE\nCan you attract another person gravita-\ntionally?

The mass of the\nEarth is mE = 5.98 × 1024 kg.\nAPPROACH We could plug all the numbers into Eq. 5-4, but there is a simpler\napproach. The spacecraft is twice as far from the Earth\'s center as when it is\nat the surface of the Earth. Therefore, since the force of gravity FG decreases as\nthe square of the distance (and 72 = 4), the force of gravity on the satellite will\nbe only one-fourth its weight at the Earth\'s surface.\nSOLUTION At the surface of the Earth, FG = mg.

This force of gravity due to the Earth is the\nweight of the object on Earth, which we have been writing as mg.

How would the acceleration of gravity, g, at the surface change?\n5-7 Satellites and "Weightlessness"\nSatellite Motion\nArtificial satellites circling the Earth are now commonplace (Fig. 5-21). A satellite\nis put into orbit by accelerating it to a sufficiently high tangential speed with the use\nof rockets, as shown in Fig. 5-22. If the speed is too high, the spacecraft will not be\nconfined by the Earth\'s gravity and will escape, never to return. If the speed is too\nlow, it will return to Earth. Satellites are typically put into circular (or nearly circu-\nlar) orbits, because such orbits require the least takeoff speed.\n27,000 km/h\n(circular orbit)\n30,000 km/h\n(elliptical orbit)\n40,000 km/h\n(escape from Earth)\nFIGURE 5-21 A satellite, the International Space Station,\ncircling the Earth.\nFIGURE 5-23 A moving satellite\n"falls" out of a straight-line path\ntoward the Earth.\nWithout\ngravity\nWith\ngravity\nFIGURE 5-22 Artificial satellites launched at\ndifferent speeds. Escape velocity from Earth is\nabout 40,000 km/h.\nIt is sometimes asked: "What keeps a satellite up?" The answer is: its high\nspeed. If a satellite in orbit stopped moving, it would fall directly to Earth. But at\nthe very high speed a satellite has, it would quickly fly out into space (Fig. 5-23)\nif it weren\'t for the gravitational force of the Earth pulling it into orbit. In fact,\na satellite in orbit is falling (accelerating) toward Earth, but its high tangential\nspeed keeps it from hitting Earth.\nFor satellites that move in a circle (at least approximately), the needed acceler-\nation is centripetal and equals v2/r. The force that gives a satellite this acceleration\nis the force of gravity exerted by the Earth, and since a satellite may be at a\nconsiderable distance from the Earth, we must use Newton\'s law of universal\ngravitation (Eq. 5-4) for the force acting on it. When we apply Newton\'s second\nlaw, ≥FR = mar in the radial direction, we find\nG\n2\nmmE = m " ,\n(5-6)\nwhere m is the mass of the satellite. This equation relates the distance of\nthe satellite from the Earth\'s center, r, to its speed, v, in a circular orbit.\nNote that only one force-gravity-is acting on the satellite, and that r is the sum\nof the Earth\'s radius rE plus the satellite\'s height h above the Earth: r = rE + h.\n122 CHAPTER 5 Circular Motion; Gravitation\n', 'chapter_title': '5-1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'If we solve Eq. 5-6 for v, we find v = VGmE/r and we see that a satellite\'s\nspeed does not depend on its own mass.

A geosynchronous satellite is\none that stays above the same point on the Earth, which is possible only if it\nis above a point on the equator. Why? Because the center of a satellite orbit is\nalways at the center of the Earth; so it is not possible to have a satellite orbiting\nabove a fixed point on the Earth at any latitude other than 0°.

We substitute this into the\n"satellite equation" above and obtain (after cancelling msat on both sides):\nME\nGE = T2\n(2Tr)2\nAfter cancelling an r, we can solve for r3:\n+3 =\nGmET2\n4772\n=\n(6.67 × 10-11 N · m2/kg2)(5.98 × 1024 kg)(86,400 s)2\n4772\n= 7.54 × 1022 m3.\nWe take the cube root and find\nr = 4.22 × 107 m,\nor 42,200 km from the Earth\'s center. We subtract the Earth\'s radius of 6380 km\nto find that a geosynchronous satellite must orbit about 36,000 km (about 6rE)\nabove the Earth\'s surface.\n(b) We solve for v in the satellite equation, Eq. 5-6:\nv\n1\n3070 m/s,\nor about 11,000 km/h (~ 7000 mi/h).

(c) In a freely falling\nelevator, the bag experiences\n"weightlessness": the scale reads\nzero.\nWeightlessness\nPeople and other objects in a satellite circling the Earth are said to experience\napparent weightlessness. Let us first look at a simpler case: a falling elevator. In\nFig. 5-24a, an elevator is at rest with a bag hanging from a spring scale. The\nscale reading indicates the downward force exerted on it by the bag. This force,\nexerted on the scale, is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the scale\nupward on the bag, and we call its magnitude w (for "weight"). Two forces act on\nthe bag: the downward gravitational force and the upward force exerted by the\nscale equal to w. Because the bag is not accelerating (a = 0), when we apply\n¿F = ma to the bag in Fig. 5-24a we obtain\nw - mg = 0,\nwhere mg is the weight of the bag. Thus, w = mg, and since the scale indicates\nthe force w exerted on it by the bag, it registers a force equal to the weight of the\nbag, as we expect.\nNow let the elevator have an acceleration, a. Applying Newton\'s second law,\n¿F = ma, to the bag as seen from an inertial reference frame (the elevator itself\nis not now an inertial frame) we have\nw - mg = ma.\nSolving for w, we have\nW = mg + ma.\n[a is + upward]\nWe have chosen the positive direction up. Thus, if the acceleration a is up, a is\npositive; and the scale, which measures w, will read more than mg. We call w the\napparent weight of the bag, which in this case would be greater than its actual\nweight (mg). If the elevator accelerates downward, a will be negative and w, the\napparent weight, will be less than mg. The direction of the velocity v doesn\'t\nmatter. Only the direction of the acceleration a (and its magnitude) influences\nthe scale reading.\nSuppose the elevator\'s acceleration is 2 g upward; then we find\nw = mg + m(2g)\n= 2mg.\nThat is, the scale reads 12 times the actual weight of the bag (Fig. 5-24b). The\napparent weight of the bag is 1 2 times its real weight. The same is true of the per-\nson: her apparent weight (equal to the normal force exerted on her by the elevator\nfloor) is 12 times her real weight. We can say that she is experiencing 12 g\'s, just\nas astronauts experience so many g\'s at a rocket\'s launch.\nIf, instead, the elevator\'s acceleration is a = - 2g (downward), then\nw= mg - 2mg = 2mg. That is, the scale reads half the actual weight. If the\nelevator is in free fall (for example, if the cables break), then a = - g and\nW = mg - mg = 0. The scale reads zero. See Fig. 5-24c. The bag appears weight-\nless. If the person in the elevator accelerating at -g let go of a box, it would\nnot fall to the floor. True, the box would be falling with acceleration g. But so\nwould the floor of the elevator and the person. The box would hover right\nin front of the person. This phenomenon is called apparent weightlessness\nbecause in the reference frame of the person, objects don\'t fall or seem to have\nweight-yet gravity does not disappear. Gravity is still acting on each object,\nwhose weight is still mg.\n124 CHAPTER 5 Circular Motion; Gravitation\n', 'chapter_title': '5-1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The "weightlessness" experienced by people in a satellite orbit close to the\nEarth (Fig. 5-25) is the same apparent weightlessness experienced in a freely\nfalling elevator. It may seem strange, at first, to think of a satellite as freely falling.\nBut a satellite is indeed falling toward the Earth, as was shown in Fig. 5-23. The\nforce of gravity causes it to "fall" out of its natural straight-line path. The accel-\neration of the satellite must be the acceleration due to gravity at that point, because\nthe only force acting on it is gravity. Thus, although the force of gravity acts on\nobjects within the satellite, the objects experience an apparent weightlessness\nbecause they, and the satellite, are accelerating together as in free fall.\nFigure 5-26 shows some examples of "free fall," or apparent weightlessness,\nexperienced by people on Earth for brief moments.\nA completely different situation occurs if a spacecraft is out in space far from\nthe Earth, the Moon, and other attracting bodies. The force of gravity due to the\nEarth and other celestial bodies will then be quite small because of the distances\ninvolved, and persons in such a spacecraft would experience real weightlessness.\nEXERCISE F Return to Chapter-Opening Question 2, page 109, and answer it again\nnow.

Have you ever escaped the lights of\nthe city to gaze late at night at the multitude of stars in the night sky? It is a\nmoving experience. Thousands of years ago, the ancients saw this sight every\ncloudless night, and were fascinated. They noted that the vast majority of stars,\nbright or dim, seemed to maintain fixed positions relative to each other. The\nancients imagined these fixed stars as being attached to a huge inverted bowl, or\nsphere. This celestial sphere revolved around the Earth almost exactly once a day\n(Fig. 5-27), from east to west. Among all the stars that were visible to the naked\neye (there were no telescopes until much later, about 1600), the ancients saw five\nstars that changed position relative to the fixed stars over weeks and months.\nThese five wandering stars were called planets (Greek for wandering). Planets\nwere thus visible at night as tiny points of light like other stars.\nThe ancient idea that the Sun, Moon, and planets revolve around the Earth\nis called the geocentric view (geo = Earth in Greek). It was developed into a fine\ntheoretical system by Ptolemy in the second century B.C. Today we believe in a\nheliocentric system (helios = Sun in Greek), where the Earth is just another\nplanet, between Venus and Mars, orbiting around the Sun. Although a heliocentric\nview was proposed in ancient times, it was largely ignored until Renaissance Italy\nof the fifteenth century. The real theory change (see Section 1-1 and Fig. 1-2)\nbegan with the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) and then\nwas greatly advanced by the experimental observations of Galileo around 1610 using\nhis newly developed 30× telescope. Galileo observed that the planet Jupiter has\nmoons (like a miniature solar system) and that Venus has phases like our Moon, not\nexplainable by Ptolemy\'s geocentric system. [Galileo\'s famous encounter with the\nChurch had little to do with religious faith, but rather with politics, personality\nconflict, and authority. Today it is generally understood that science and faith are\ndifferent approaches that are not in conflict.]\nFIGURE 5-27 Time exposure\nshowing movement of stars over a\nperiod of several hours.\nSECTION 5-8 125\n', 'chapter_title': '5-1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Planet\nP\nN\nSun\nF2\nM\ns\ns\nFIGURE 5-28 Kepler\'s first law.\nAn ellipse is a closed curve such\nthat the sum of the distances from\nany point P on the curve to two\nfixed points (called the foci, F1 and\nF2) remains constant.

The planet moves from point 1\nto point 2 in the same time it takes to\nmove from point 3 to point 4. Planets\nmove fastest when closest to the Sun.\nKepler\'s Laws\nAlso about 1600, more than a half century before Newton proposed his three laws\nof motion and his law of universal gravitation, the German astronomer Johannes\nKepler (1571-1630) had worked out a detailed description of the motion of the\nplanets around the Sun. Kepler\'s work resulted in part from the many years he\nspent examining data collected (without a telescope) by Tycho Brahe (1546-1601)\non the positions of the planets in their motion through the night sky.\nAmong Kepler\'s writings were three empirical findings that we now refer to\nas Kepler\'s laws of planetary motion. These are summarized as follows, with\nadditional explanation in Figs. 5-28 and 5-29.\nKepler\'s first law: The path of each planet around the Sun is an ellipse with the\nSun at one focus (Fig. 5-28).\nKepler\'s second law: Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the\nSun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal periods of time (Fig. 5-29).\nKepler\'s third law: The ratio of the squares of the periods T of any two planets\nrevolving around the Sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their mean dis-\ntances from the Sun. [The mean distance equals the semimajor axis s (= half\nthe distance from the planet\'s near point N and far point M from the Sun,\nFig. 5-28).] That is, if T1 and T2 represent the periods (the time needed for\none revolution about the Sun) for any two planets, and $1 and s2 represent their\nmean distances from the Sun, then\n¢\nT1 ) 2\nT2\n=\n51)\n3\nS2\n.\n1\nSun\nWe can rewrite Kepler\'s third law as\n4\n5] = 52.\n3\nT2\nT?\n2\nTABLE 5-2 Planetary Data\nApplied to Kepler\'s Third Law\nmeaning that s3/T2 should be the same for each planet.

We can\nfind the distance from Mars to the Sun using Kepler\'s third law, given the\nEarth-Sun distance as 1.50 × 1011 m (Table 5-2; also Table inside front cover).\nSOLUTION Let the distance of Mars from the Sun be SMS, and the Earth-Sun\ndistance be SES = 1.50 × 1011 m.

(Most planetary orbits\nare close to a circle.) First, we write Newton\'s second law of motion, ¿F = ma.\nFor F we use the law of universal gravitation (Eq. 5-4) for the force between the\nSun and a planet of mass m1, and for a the centripetal acceleration, v2/r.

For example, slight deviations from perfectly\nelliptical orbits were observed. Newton was aware that this was to be expected\nbecause any planet would be attracted gravitationally not only by the Sun but also\n(to a much lesser extent) by the other planets. Such deviations, or perturbations,\nin the orbit of Saturn were a hint that helped Newton formulate the law of\nuniversal gravitation, that all objects attract each other gravitationally. Observa-\ntion of other perturbations later led to the discovery of Neptune. Deviations\nin the orbit of Uranus could not all be accounted for by perturbations\ndue to the other known planets. Careful calculation in the nineteenth century\nindicated that these deviations could be accounted for if another planet existed\nfarther out in the solar system. The position of this planet was predicted from\nthe deviations in the orbit of Uranus, and telescopes focused on that region of\nthe sky quickly found it; the new planet was called Neptune. Similar but much\nsmaller perturbations of Neptune's orbit led to the discovery of Pluto in 1930.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nPerturbations and\ndiscovery of planets\nSECTION 5-8 127\n", 'chapter_title': '5-1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CAUTION\nCompare orbits of objects\nonly around the same center\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nPlanets around\nother stars\nOther Centers for Kepler\'s Laws\nThe derivation of Eq. 5-7b, Kepler\'s third law, compared two planets revolving\naround the Sun. But the derivation is general enough to be applied to other systems.\nFor example, we could apply Eq. 5-7b to compare an artificial satellite and our\nMoon, both revolving around Earth (then Ms would be replaced by ME , the mass\nof the Earth). Or we could apply Eq. 5-7b to compare two moons revolving around\nJupiter. But Kepler\'s third law, Eq. 5-7b, applies only to objects orbiting the same\nattracting center. Do not use Eq. 5-7b to compare, say, the Moon\'s orbit around\nEarth to the orbit of Mars around the Sun: they depend on different attracting centers.\nDistant Planetary Systems\nStarting in the mid-1990s, planets revolving around distant stars (Fig. 5-30)\nwere inferred from the regular "wobble" in position of each star due to the gravi-\ntational attraction of the revolving planet(s). Many such "extrasolar" planets are\nnow known.\nFIGURE 5-30 Our solar system\nMercury\nVenus\nEarth\nMars\nJupiter\n(a) is compared to recently\n(a)\nSun\ndiscovered planets orbiting (b) the\nC\nmy\nstar Upsilon Andromedae with at\nA\nB\nleast three planets. my is the mass of\nJupiter.

He thus used Kepler\'s laws as evidence in favor of his law of\nuniversal gravitation, Eq. 5-4.\nThe development by Newton of the law of universal gravitation and the three\nlaws of motion was a major intellectual achievement. With these laws, he was\nable to describe the motion of objects on Earth and of the far-away planets seen\nin the night sky. The motions of the planets through the heavens and of objects\non Earth were seen to follow the same laws (not recognized previously). For this\nreason, and also because Newton integrated the results of earlier scientists into\nhis system, we sometimes speak of Newton\'s synthesis.\nThe laws formulated by Newton are referred to as causal laws. By causality we\nmean that one occurrence can cause another. When a rock strikes a window, we infer\nthe rock causes the window to break. This idea of "cause and effect" relates to Newton\'s\nlaws: the acceleration of an object was seen to be caused by the net force acting on it.\nAs a result of Newton\'s theories, the universe came to be viewed by many as\na machine whose parts move in a deterministic way. This deterministic view of the\nuniverse had to be modified in the twentieth century (Chapter 28).\nSun/Earth Reference Frames\nThe geocentric-heliocentric controversy (page 125) may be seen today as a matter of\nframe of reference. From the reference frame of Earth, we see the Sun and Moon\nas revolving around us with average periods of 24 h (= definition of 1 day) and\nalmost 25 h, respectively, roughly in circles. The orbits of the planets as seen from\nEarth are very complicated, however.\nIn the Sun\'s reference frame, Earth makes one revolution (= definition of the\nyear) in 365.256 days, in an ellipse that is nearly a circle. The Sun\'s reference frame\nhas the advantage that the other planets also have simple elliptical orbits. (Or nearly\nso-each planet\'s gravity pulls on the others, causing small perturbations.) The Sun\'s\nvastly greater mass (>105 × Earth\'s) allows it to be an easier reference frame to use.\nThe Sun itself (and the Earth with it) revolves around the center of our Galaxy\n(see Fig. 33-2 or 5-49) which itself moves relative to other galaxies. Indeed, there is\nno one reference frame that we can consider as preferred or central.\n128 CHAPTER 5\n', 'chapter_title': '5-1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Earth (t = 0)\nSun\nFIGURE 5-31 Looking down on the plane of Earth\'s orbit\naround the Sun (not to scale), above Earth\'s north pole, showing\nour Moon making one revolution about Earth: (a) at a Full moon\n(the red dot is an observer at about 6 PM who can just see the Full\nmoon rise); (b) exactly one day later (for the red dot to see the\nMoon rise, the Earth must rotate another 50 min); (c) after making a\n"half revolution" the Moon is in line with the Sun, on the Sun\'s side,\nand is a New moon; (d) after the Moon makes one complete revolution\naround Earth (sidereal period); (e) at the next Full moon (synodic\nperiod).

When the Moon is on the direct oppo-\nsite side of Earth from the Sun, the Sun\'s light fully illuminates the Moon and we\ncall it a Full moon (Fig. 5-31a). When the Moon is on the same side of the Earth\nas the Sun, and nearly aligned with both, we see the Moon as a thin sliver-most\nor all of it is in shadow (= a New moon). The phases of the Moon (new, first\nquarter, full, third quarter) take it from one Full moon to the next Full moon in\n29.53 days (= synodic period) on average, as seen from the Earth as reference frame\n(Fig. 5-31e). In the Sun\'s frame of reference, the Moon revolves around the Earth in\n27.32 days (sidereal period, Fig. 5-31d). This small difference arises because, when\nthe Moon has made one complete revolution around the Earth, the Earth itself\nhas moved in its orbit relative to the Sun. So the Moon needs more time (~ 2 days)\nto be fully aligned with the Sun and Earth and be a Full moon, Fig. 5-31e. The\nred dot in Figs. 5-31a, b, and e represents an observer at the same location on Earth,\nwhich in (a) is when the Full moon is rising and the Sun is just setting.\n5-10 Types of Forces in Nature\nWe have already discussed that Newton\'s law of universal gravitation, Eq. 5-4,\ndescribes how a particular type of force-gravity-depends on the masses of the\nobjects involved and the distance between them. Newton\'s second law, 2F = ma,\non the other hand, tells how an object will accelerate due to any type of force. But\nwhat are the types of forces that occur in nature besides gravity?\nIn the twentieth century, physicists came to recognize four fundamental forces\nin nature: (1) the gravitational force; (2) the electromagnetic force (we shall see\nlater that electric and magnetic forces are intimately related); (3) the strong nuclear\nforce (which holds protons and neutrons together to form atomic nuclei); and\n(4) the weak nuclear force (involved in radioactivity). In this Chapter, we dis-\ncussed the gravitational force in detail. The nature of the electromagnetic force\nwill be discussed in Chapters 16 to 22. The strong and weak nuclear forces, which\nare discussed in Chapters 30 to 32, operate at the level of the atomic nucleus\nand are much less obvious in our daily lives.\nPhysicists have been working on theories that would unify these four forces-\nthat is, to consider some or all of these forces as different manifestations of the\nsame basic force. So far, the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces have been\ntheoretically united to form electroweak theory, in which the electromagnetic and\nweak forces are seen as two aspects of a single electroweak force. Attempts to further\nunify the forces, such as in grand unified theories (GUT), are hot research topics today.\nBut where do everyday forces fit? Ordinary forces, other than gravity, such as\npushes, pulls, and other contact forces like the normal force and friction, are today\nconsidered to be due to the electromagnetic force acting at the atomic level. For\nexample, the force your fingers exert on a pencil is the result of electrical repulsion\nbetween the outer electrons of the atoms of your finger and those of the pencil.\nSECTION 5-10 129\n', 'chapter_title': '5-1 Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion'}, {'page_number': 22, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Summary\nAn object moving in a circle of radius r with constant speed v is\nsaid to be in uniform circular motion.

It is this gravitational\nforce that keeps the Moon revolving around the Earth, and the\nplanets revolving around the Sun.\nSatellites revolving around the Earth are acted on by\ngravity, but "stay up" because of their high tangential speed.\nNewton\'s three laws of motion, plus his law of universal\ngravitation, constituted a wide-ranging theory of the universe.\nWith them, motion of objects on Earth and in space could be\naccurately described. And they provided a theoretical base for\nKepler\'s laws of planetary motion.\nThe four fundamental forces in nature are (1) the gravi-\ntational force, (2) the electromagnetic force, (3) the strong nuclear\nforce, and (4) the weak nuclear force. The first two fundamental\nforces are responsible for nearly all "everyday" forces.\n9. Astronauts who spend long periods in outer space could be\nadversely affected by weightlessness.
