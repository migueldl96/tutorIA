These\ndiscoveries were made in 1820-1821. Scientists then began to wonder: if electric\ncurrents produce a magnetic field, is it possible that a magnetic field can produce\nan electric current? Ten years later the American Joseph Henry (1797-1878)\nand the Englishman Michael Faraday (1791-1867) independently found that it\nwas possible. Henry actually made the discovery first. But Faraday published his\nresults earlier and investigated the subject in more detail. We now discuss this\nphenomenon and some of its world-changing applications including the electric\ngenerator.\n590\n", 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': "21-1 Induced EMF\nIn his attempt to produce an electric current from a magnetic field, Faraday used\nan apparatus like that shown in Fig. 21-1. A coil of wire, X, was connected to a\nbattery. The current that flowed through X produced a magnetic field that was\nintensified by the ring-shaped iron core around which the wire was wrapped.\nFaraday hoped that a strong steady current in X would produce a great enough mag-\nnetic field to produce a current in a second coil Y wrapped on the same iron ring.\nGalvanometer\nIron\n+\nSwitch\n0\n-10\n10\nFIGURE 21-1 Faraday's experiment\nto induce an emf.\nBattery\nX\nY\nThis second circuit, Y, contained a galvanometer to detect any current but contained\nno battery. He met no success with constant currents. But the long-sought effect was\nfinally observed when Faraday noticed the galvanometer in circuit Y deflect strongly\nat the moment he closed the switch in circuit X. And the galvanometer deflected\nstrongly in the opposite direction when he opened the switch in X. A constant\ncurrent in X produced a constant magnetic field which produced no current in Y.\nOnly when the current in X was starting or stopping was a current produced in Y.\nFaraday concluded that although a constant magnetic field produces no current\nin a conductor, a changing magnetic field can produce an electric current. Such a cur-\nrent is called an induced current. When the magnetic field through coil Y changes,\na current occurs in Y as if there were a source of emf in circuit Y. We therefore say that\na changing magnetic field induces an emf.\nFaraday did further experiments on electromagnetic induction, as this phenom-\nenon is called. For example, Fig. 21-2 shows that if a magnet is moved quickly into\na coil of wire, a current is induced in the wire. If the magnet is quickly removed,\na current is induced in the opposite direction (B through the coil decreases).\nFurthermore, if the magnet is held steady and the coil of wire is moved toward\nor away from the magnet, again an emf is induced and a current flows. Motion or\nchange is required to induce an emf. It doesn't matter whether the magnet or the\ncoil moves. It is their relative motion that counts.\nCAUTION\nChanging B, not B itself,\ninduces current\nCAUTION\nRelative motion-magnet\nor coil moving induces current\nFIGURE 21-2 (a) A current is induced when a magnet is moved toward a coil, momentarily increasing the magnetic\nfield through the coil. (b) The induced current is opposite when the magnet is moved away from the coil (B decreases).\nNote that the galvanometer zero is at the center of the scale and the needle deflects left or right, depending on the\ndirection of the current. In (c), no current is induced if the magnet does not move relative to the coil. It is the\nrelative motion that counts here: the magnet can be held steady and the coil moved, which also induces an emf.\n0\nTO\n0\n10\nTO\nO\n0\nI\nI\nI\nN\nN\nMagnet\nmoves up\ntoward coil\n(B in coil\nincreasing)\nI\n(b)\n(a)\nS\nN\nMagnet\nmoves\ndown\n(B in coil\nS\ndecreasing)\n(c)\nS\nO\nI=0\nNo\nmovement\n(B in coil\nconstant)\nSECTION 21-1 591\n", 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': "B\nθ\nB\nA = 02\nl\nEXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 590, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\n21-2 Faraday's Law of Induction; Lenz's Law\nFaraday investigated quantitatively what factors influence the magnitude of the emf\ninduced. He found first of all that the more rapidly the magnetic field changes, the\ngreater the induced emf. He also found that the induced emf depends on the area\nof the circuit loop (and also the angle it makes with B). In fact, it is found that the\nemf is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux, ØB, passing through\nthe circuit or loop of area A. Magnetic flux for a uniform magnetic field through\na loop of area A is defined as\nl\nФв = BLA = BA cos 0.\n[B uniform] (21-1)\nHere B_ is the component of the magnetic field B perpendicular to the face of the\nloop, and 0 is the angle between B and a line perpendicular to the face of the\nloop. These quantities are shown in Fig. 21-3 for a square loop of side ( whose\narea is A = {2. When the face of the loop is parallel to B, 0 = 90° and B = 0.\nWhen B is perpendicular to the face of the loop, 0 = 0°, and\nFIGURE 21-3 Determining the flux\nthrough a flat loop of wire.

Then the\nflux Pp can be thought of as being proportional to the total number of lines\npassing through the area enclosed by the loop. This is illustrated in Fig. 21-4,\nwhere three wire loops of a coil are viewed from the side (on edge). For 0 = 90°,\nno magnetic field lines pass through the loops and @B = 0, whereas Øp is a maxi-\nmum when 0 = 0°. The unit of magnetic flux is the tesla-meter2; this is called\na weber: 1 Wb = 1 T · m2.\nWith our definition of flux, Eq. 21-1, we can write down the results of Faraday's\ninvestigations: The emf & induced in a circuit is equal to the rate of change of\nmagnetic flux through the circuit:\n–\nДФв\n.\nThis fundamental result is known as Faraday's law of induction, and it is one of\nthe basic laws of electromagnetism.\nIf the circuit contains N loops that are closely wrapped so the same flux passes\nthrough each, the emfs induced in each loop add together, so the total emf is\n90\n= - N\nAt\nДФв\n.\n[N loops] (21-2b)\nEXAMPLE 21-1\nA loop of wire in a magnetic field.

(c) What is the magnitude\nof the average current in the loop if it has a resistance of 0.012 (2 and it is rotated\nfrom position (b) to position (a) in 0.14 s?\nAPPROACH We use the definition @B = BA cos 0, Eq. 21-1, to calculate the\nmagnetic flux. Then we use Faraday's law of induction to find the induced emf\nin the coil, and from that the induced current (I = %/R).\nSOLUTION The area of the coil is A = {2 = (5.0 X 10-2 m)2 = 2.5 X 10-3 m2.\n(a) B is perpendicular to the coil's face, so 0 = 0° and\nФв = BA cos 0° = (0.16 Т)(2.5 Х 10-3 m2)(1) = 4.0 x 10-4T.m2\nor 4.0 × 10-4 Wb.\n(b) The angle 0 is 30° and cos 30° = 0.866, so\nФв = BA cos 0 = (0.16 T)(2.5 x 10-3 m2) cos 30° = 3.5 x 10-4T. m2\nor 3.5 × 10-4 Wb, a bit less than in part (a).\n592 CHAPTER 21\n", 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': '(c) The magnitude of the induced emf (Eq. 21-2a) during the 0.14-s time interval is\n(4.0 × 10-4T·m2) - (3.5×10-4T·m2)\n8 =\nДФв\n=\nAt\n0.14 s\n= 3.6 ×10-4 V.\nBefore and after the loop rotates, when it is at rest, the emf is zero.

Experiments show that\na current produced by an induced emf moves in a direction so that the\nmagnetic field created by that current opposes the original change in flux.\nThis is known as Lenz\'s law. Be aware that we are now discussing two distinct mag-\nnetic fields: (1) the changing magnetic field or flux that induces the current, and\n(2) the magnetic field produced by the induced current (all currents produce a\nmagnetic field). The second (induced) field opposes the change in the first.\nLenz\'s law can be said another way, valid even if no current can flow (as when\na circuit is not complete):\nAn induced emf is always in a direction that opposes the original change in\nflux that caused it.\nLet us apply Lenz\'s law to the relative motion between a magnet and a coil,\nFig. 21-2. The changing flux through the coil induces an emf in the coil, produc-\ning a current. This induced current produces its own magnetic field. In Fig. 21-2a\nthe distance between the coil and the magnet decreases. The magnet\'s magnetic\nfield (and number of field lines) through the coil increases, and therefore the flux\nincreases. The magnetic field of the magnet points upward. To oppose the upward\nincrease, the magnetic field produced by the induced current needs to point\ndownward inside the coil. Thus, Lenz\'s law tells us the current moves as shown in\nFig. 21-2a (use the right-hand rule). In Fig. 21-2b, the flux decreases (because the\nmagnet is moved away and B decreases), so the induced current in the coil produces\nan upward magnetic field through the coil that is "trying" to maintain the status\nquo. Thus the current in Fig. 21-2b is in the opposite direction from Fig. 21-2a.\nIt is important to note that an emf is induced whenever there is a change in\nflux through the coil, and we now consider some more possibilities.\nXX\nX\nXX\nXIX\nFlux\nthrough\ncoil is\ndecreased\nbecause A\nX\nX\n×\n×\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n4\nX\nX\n×\n×\nX\nX\nX\nB\nX\nX\nB\ndecreased\n×\nX\n×\nXX\nX\n(inward)\n(a)\n(b)\nMagnetic flux @B = BAcos0, so an emf can be induced in three ways:\n(1) by a changing magnetic field B; (2) by changing the area A of the loop in the field;\nor (3) by changing the loop\'s orientation 0 with respect to the field.

Why will it heat a metal pan, usually iron, but not a glass container?\nRESPONSE The ac current sets up a changing magnetic field that passes through\nthe pan bottom. This changing magnetic field induces a current in the pan, and\nsince the pan offers resistance, electric energy is transformed to thermal energy which\nheats the pan and its contents. If the pan is iron, magnetic hysteresis due to the\nchanging current produces additional heating.

Once you know the direction of the induced magnetic\nfield, use right-hand-rule-1 (page 563, Chapter 20) to\nfind the direction of the induced current.\n4.

If you pull the loop out of the field, magnetic flux through the\nloop decreases; so the induced current will be in a direction to maintain the\ndecreasing flux through the loop: the current will be counterclockwise to\nproduce a magnetic field outward (toward the reader).\n(b) The external field is into the page. The coil area gets smaller, so the flux will\ndecrease; hence the induced current will be clockwise, producing its own field\ninto the page to make up for the flux decrease.\n(c) Magnetic field lines point into the S pole of a magnet, so as the magnet\nmoves toward us and the loop, the magnet\'s field points into the page and is\ngetting stronger. The current in the loop will be induced in the counterclock-\nwise direction in order to produce a field B out of the page.\n(d) The field is in the plane of the loop, so no magnetic field lines pass through\nthe loop and the flux through the loop is zero throughout the process; hence\nthere is no change in flux and no induced emf or current in the loop.\n(e) Initially there is no flux through the loop. When you start to rotate the loop,\nthe external field through the loop begins increasing to the left. To counteract\nthis change in flux, the loop will have current induced in a counterclockwise\ndirection so as to produce its own field to the right.\n594 CHAPTER 21\n', 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 21-4\nPulling a coil from a magnetic field.

Assume that a uniform magnetic field B\nis perpendicular to the area bounded by the U-shaped conductor and the movable\nrod resting on it. If the rod is made to move at a speed v to the right, it travels a\ndistance Ax = v At in a time At. Therefore, the area of the loop increases by\nan amount AA = { Ax = to At in a time At. By Faraday's law there is an induced\nemf & whose magnitude is given by\nADD - BAA = B\nBlv At\n= Blv.\nAt\n(21-3)\nThe induced current is clockwise (to counter the increasing flux).\nEquation 21-3 is valid as long as B, l, and v are mutually perpendicular. (If they\nare not, we use only the components of each that are mutually perpendicular.) An emf\ninduced on a conductor moving in a magnetic field is sometimes called motional emf.\nWe can also obtain Eq. 21-3 without using Faraday's law. We saw in Chapter 20\nthat a charged particle moving with speed v perpendicular to a magnetic field B\nexperiences a force F = quB (Eq. 20-4). When the rod of Fig. 21-11a moves to\nthe right with speed v, the electrons in the rod also move with this speed. Therefore,\nsince v 1 B, each electron feels a force F = quB, which acts up the page as the red\narrow in Fig. 21-11b shows. If the rod is not in contact with the U-shaped conductor,\nelectrons would collect at the upper end of the rod, leaving the lower end positive\n(see signs in Fig. 21-11b). There must thus be an induced emf. If the rod is in\ncontact with the U-shaped conductor (Fig. 21-11a), the electrons will flow into the U.\nThere will then be a clockwise (conventional) current in the loop. To calculate the\nemf, we determine the work W needed to move a charge q from one end of the rod\nto the other against this potential difference: W = force X distance = (quB)(l).\nThe emf equals the work done per unit charge, so % = W /q = qvBl/q = Blv,\nthe same result as from Faraday's law above, Eq. 21-3.\nEXERCISE C In what direction will the electrons flow in Fig. 21-11 if the rod moves to\nthe left, decreasing the area of the current loop?\nEXAMPLE 21-5\nESTIMATE\nDoes a moving airplane develop a large emf?\nAn airplane travels 1000 km/h in a region where the Earth's magnetic field is\nabout 5 × 10-5 T and is nearly vertical (Fig. 21-12). What is the potential differ-\nence induced between the wing tips that are 70 m apart?\nAPPROACH We consider the wings to be a 70-m-long conductor moving through\nthe Earth's magnetic field. We use Eq. 21-3 to get the emf.\nSOLUTION Since v = 1000 km/h = 280 m/s, and v 1 B, we have\n%= Blv = (5× 10-5T)(70m)(280 m/s) ~ 1 V.\nNOTE Not much to worry about.\nEXAMPLE 21-6\nElectromagnetic blood-flow measurement. The rate of\nblood flow in our body's vessels can be measured using the apparatus shown in\nFig. 21-13, since blood contains charged ions. Suppose that the blood vessel is\n2.0 mm in diameter, the magnetic field is 0.080 T, and the measured emf is 0.10 mV.\nWhat is the flow velocity v of the blood?\nAPPROACH The magnetic field B points horizontally from left to right (N pole\ntoward S pole). The induced emf acts over the width ( = 2.0 mm of the blood\nvessel, perpendicular to B and v (Fig. 21-13), just as in Fig. 21-11.

In a closed loop of\nwire there will also be an induced current, which implies there is an electric field\nin the wire causing the electrons to start moving. Indeed, this and other results\nsuggest the important conclusion that\na changing magnetic flux produces an electric field.\nThis result applies not only to wires and other conductors, but is a general result\nthat applies to any region in space. Indeed, an electric field will be produced\n(= induced) at any point in space where there is a changing magnetic field.\nWe can get a simple formula for E in terms of B for the case of electrons in\na moving conductor, as in Fig. 21-11. The electrons feel a force (upwards in\nFig. 21-11b); and if we put ourselves in the reference frame of the conductor, this\nforce accelerating the electrons implies that there is an electric field in the\nconductor. Electric field is defined as the force per unit charge, E = F/q, where\nhere F = quB (Eq. 20-4). Thus the effective field E in the rod must be\nE = = 90B.\nqvB\n= vB,\n(21-4)\nAxle rotated\nmechanically\nArmature\nI\nb\nwhich is a useful result.\nN\na\nS\nI\n21-5 Electric Generators\nWe discussed alternating currents (ac) briefly in Section 18-7. Now we examine\nhow ac is generated: by an electric generator or dynamo. A generator transforms\nmechanical energy into electric energy, just the opposite of what a motor does\n(Section 20-10). A simplified diagram of an ac generator is shown in Fig. 21-14.\nA generator consists of many loops of wire (only one is shown) wound on an\narmature that can rotate in a magnetic field. The axle is turned by some mechan-\nical means (falling water, steam turbine, car motor belt), and an emf is induced in\nthe rotating coil. An electric current is thus the output of a generator. Suppose in\nFig. 21-14 that the armature is rotating clockwise; then right-hand-rule-3 (p. 568)\napplied to charged particles in the wire (or Lenz's law) tells us that the\n(conventional) current in the wire labeled b on the armature is outward towards us;\ntherefore the current is outward through brush b. (Each brush is fixed and presses\nagainst a continuous slip ring that rotates with the armature.) After one-half\nrevolution, wire b will be where wire a is now in Fig. 21-14, and the current then\nat brush b will be inward. Thus the current produced is alternating.\nThe frequency f is 60 Hz for general use in the United States and Canada,\nwhereas 50 Hz is used in many countries. Most of the power generated in the\nUnited States is done at steam plants, where the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil,\nnatural gas) boils water to produce high-pressure steam that turns a turbine\nconnected to the generator axle (Fig. 15-21). Turbines can also be turned by\nwater pressure at a dam (hydroelectric). At nuclear power plants, the nuclear\nenergy released is used to produce steam to turn turbines. Indeed, a heat engine\n(Chapter 15) connected to a generator is the principal means of generating\nelectric power. The frequency of 60 Hz or 50 Hz is maintained very precisely by\npower companies.\nA dc generator is much like an ac generator, except the slip rings are\nreplaced by split-ring commutators, Fig. 21-15a, just as in a dc motor (Figs. 20-37\nand 20-38). The output of such a generator is as shown and can be smoothed out\nby placing a capacitor in parallel with the output.+ More common is the use of\nmany armature windings, as in Fig. 21-15b, which produces a smoother output.\na\nSlip rings\nI\nb\nI\nBrushes\nFIGURE 21-14 An ac generator.\nFIGURE 21-15 (a) A dc generator\nwith one set of commutators, and\n(b) a dc generator with many sets of\ncommutators and windings.\nV\n(a)\nt\nV\n(b)\nt\n+A capacitor tends to store charge and, if the time constant RC\nis long enough, helps to smooth out the voltage as shown in\nthe figure to the right.\nV\nt\nSECTION 21-5 Electric Generators 597\n", 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Loops of wire\n(in which current is induced)\nStator coil (emf induced in)\nEngine\nbelt\nCurrent to\nproduce\nB field\nN\nOutput\ncurrent\n(induced)\nInput\ncurrent\nSouth\npole\nS\nNorth\npole\nN\nEngine\nbelt\nN\nS\nSlip\nrings\nS\n(Rotating\nelectromagnet)\nS\nSlip\nrings\nN\nS\nCoil\n(produces B)\nStator coil (emf induced in)\nRotates\n(a)\nRotor\nStator assembly\n(b)\nFIGURE 21-16 (a) Simplified schematic diagram of an alternator.

These end plates are made with triangular fingers that are bent\nover the coil-hence there are alternating N and S poles quite close to one another, with magnetic field lines between\nthem as shown by the blue lines. As the rotor turns, these field lines pass through the fixed stator coils (shown on the\nright for clarity, but in operation the rotor rotates within the stator), inducing a current in them, which is the output.\n* Alternators\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nAlternators\nFIGURE 21-17 The emf is induced\nin the segments ab and cd, whose\nvelocity components perpendicular\nto the field B are v sin 0.\nB\nB\nv\na\nθ\nI (induced)-\nb\n℮!\nN\nAxis\nB\nS\nc\n/I (induced)\nB\nd\nAutomobiles used to use dc generators. Today they mainly use alternators, which\navoid the problems of wear and electrical arcing (sparks) across the split-ring\ncommutators of dc generators. Alternators differ from generators in that an electro-\nmagnet, called the rotor, is fed by current from the battery and is made to rotate\nby a belt from the engine. The magnetic field of the turning rotor passes through\na surrounding set of stationary coils called the stator (Fig. 21-16), inducing an\nalternating current in the stator coils, which is the output. This ac output is changed\nto dc for charging the battery by the use of semiconductor diodes, which allow\ncurrent flow in one direction only.\nDeriving the Generator Equation\nFigure 21-17 shows the wire loop on a generator armature. The loop is being\nmade to rotate clockwise in a uniform magnetic field B. The velocity of the two\nlengths ab and cd at this instant are shown. Although the sections of wire bc and da\nare moving, the force on electrons in these sections is toward the side of the wire,\nnot along the wire's length. The emf generated is thus due only to the force on\ncharges in the sections ab and cd. From right-hand-rule-3, we see that the direc-\ntion of the induced current in ab is from a toward b. And in the lower section,\nit is from c to d; so the flow is continuous in the loop. The magnitude of the emf\ngenerated in ab is given by Eq. 21-3, except that we must take the component\nof the velocity perpendicular to B:\n% = Blv1,\nwhere { is the length of ab. From Fig. 21-17 we see that v1 = v sin 0, where 0 is\nthe angle the loop's face makes with the vertical. The emf induced in cd has the same\nmagnitude and is in the same direction. Therefore their emfs add, and the total emf is\n% = 2NBlv sin 0,\nwhere we have multiplied by N, the number of loops in the coil.\nIf the coil is rotating with constant angular velocity @, then the angle 0 = ot.\nFrom the angular equations (Eq. 8-4), v = wr = w(h/2), where r is the distance from\nthe rotation axis and h is the length of bc or ad. Thus % = 2NBol(h/2) sin ot, or\n& = NBA sin ot,\n(21-5)\nwhere A = lh is the area of the loop.

From our description in Section 20-10 of a simple dc motor, you might expect\nthat the armature would accelerate indefinitely due to the torque on it. However,\nas the armature of the motor turns, the magnetic flux through the coil changes\nand an emf is generated. This induced emf acts to oppose the motion (Lenz's law)\nand is called the back emf or counter emf. The greater the speed of the motor,\nthe greater the back emf. A motor normally turns and does work on something,\nbut if there were no load to push (or rotate), the motor's speed would increase until\nthe back emf equaled the input voltage. When there is a mechanical load, the speed\nof the motor may be limited also by the load. The back emf will then be less than\nthe external applied voltage. The greater the mechanical load, the slower the motor\nrotates and the lower is the back emf (8 x @, Eq. 21-5).\nEXAMPLE 21-8\nBack emf in a motor. The armature windings of a dc motor\nhave a resistance of 5.0 0. The motor is connected to a 120-V line, and when the\nmotor reaches full speed against its normal load, the back emf is 108 V. Calculate\n(a) the current into the motor when it is just starting up, and (b) the current when\nthe motor reaches full speed.\nAPPROACH As the motor is just starting up, it is turning very slowly, so there\nis negligible back emf. The only voltage is the 120-V line. The current is given by\nOhm's law with R = 5.0 0. At full speed, we must include as emfs both the 120-V\napplied emf and the opposing back emf.\nSOLUTION (a) At start up, the current is controlled by the 120 V applied to the\ncoil's 5.0-2 resistance. By Ohm's law,\nI = = 120 V\n5.00\n= 24 A.\n(b) When the motor is at full speed, the back emf must be included in the equivalent\ncircuit shown in Fig. 21-19. In this case, Ohm's law (or Kirchhoff's rule) gives\n120 V - 108 V = I(5.00).\nTherefore\n12 V\nI =\n5.00\n= 2.4 A.\nNOTE This result shows that the current can be very high when a motor first\nstarts up. This is why the lights in your house may dim when the motor of the\nrefrigerator (or other large motor) starts up. The large initial refrigerator current\ncauses the voltage to the lights to drop because the house wiring has resistance\nand there is some voltage drop across it when large currents are drawn.\nFIGURE 21-19 Circuit of a motor\nshowing induced back emf.\nExample 21-8.\nBack emf\ninduced in\narmature winding\nWindings\nof motor\n5.0 52\ninduced = 108 V\n% = 120 V\nSECTION 21-6 599\n", 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': "PHYSICS APPLIED\nBurning out a motor\nX\n×\nXXX\nX\nX\nB\nF\nc/\n(a)\n₿ (inward)\nd\ne\n(b)\nFIGURE 21-20 Production of eddy\ncurrents in a rotating wheel.

When using an appliance\nsuch as a blender, electric drill, or sewing machine, if the appliance is overloaded\nor jammed so that the motor slows appreciably or stops while the power is still\nconnected, the motor can burn out and be ruined. Explain why this happens.\nRESPONSE The motors are designed to run at a certain speed for a given applied\nvoltage, and the designer must take the expected back emf into account. If the\nrotation speed is reduced, the back emf will not be as high as expected (8 x @,\nEq. 21-5). The current will increase and may become large enough that the\nwindings of the motor heat up and may melt, ruining the motor.\nCounter Torque, in a Generator\nIn a generator, the situation is the reverse of that for a motor. As we saw, the\nmechanical turning of the armature induces an emf in the loops, which is the\noutput. If the generator rotates but is not connected to an external circuit,\nthe emf exists at the terminals but there is no current. In this case, it takes little effort\nto turn the armature. But if the generator is connected to a device that draws cur-\nrent, then a current flows in the coils of the armature. Because this current-carrying\ncoil is in an external magnetic field, there will be a torque exerted on it (as in\na motor), and this torque opposes the motion (use right-hand-rule-2, page 568,\nfor the force on a wire in Fig. 21-14 or 21-17). This is called a counter torque.\nThe greater the electrical load-that is, the more current that is drawn-the\ngreater will be the counter torque. Hence the external applied torque will have to\nbe greater to keep the generator turning. This makes sense from the conservation\nof energy principle. More mechanical energy input is needed to produce more\nelectric energy output.\nEXERCISE D A bicycle headlight is powered by a generator that is turned by the bicycle\nwheel. (a) If you speed up, how does the power to the light change? (b) Does the gener-\nator resist being turned as the bicycle's speed increases, and if so how?\nEddy Currents\nInduced currents are not always confined to well-defined paths such as in wires.\nConsider, for example, the rotating metal wheel in Fig. 21-20a. An external mag-\nnetic field is applied to a limited area of the wheel as shown and points into the\npage. The section of wheel in the magnetic field has an emf induced in it because the\nconductor is moving, carrying electrons with it. The flow of induced (conventional)\ncurrent in the wheel is upward in the region of the magnetic field (Fig. 21-20b),\nand the current follows a downward return path outside that region. Why?\nAccording to Lenz's law, the induced currents oppose the change that causes them.\nConsider the part of the rotating wheel labeled c in Fig. 21-20b, where the magnetic\nfield is zero but is just about to enter a region where B points into the page. To oppose\nthis inward increase in magnetic field, the induced current is counterclockwise\nto produce a field pointing out of the page (right-hand-rule-1). Similarly, region d is\nabout to move to e, where B is zero; hence the current is clockwise to produce an\ninward field opposed to this decreasing flux inward. These currents are referred\nto as eddy currents. They can be present in any conductor that is moving across\na magnetic field or through which the magnetic flux is changing.\nIn Fig. 21-20b, the magnetic field exerts a force F on the induced currents it\nhas created, and that force opposes the rotational motion. Eddy currents can be\nused in this way as a smooth braking device on, say, a rapid-transit car. In order\nto stop the car, an electromagnet can be turned on that applies its field either to\nthe wheels or to the moving steel rail below. Eddy currents can also be used to\ndampen (reduce) the oscillation of a vibrating system, which is referred to as\nmagnetic damping.\n600 CHAPTER 21 Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law\n", 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Eddy currents, however, can be a problem. For example, eddy currents induced\nin the armature of a motor or generator produce heat (P = 1%) and waste energy.\nTo reduce the eddy currents, the armatures are laminated; that is, they are made of\nvery thin sheets of iron that are well insulated from one another (used also in\ntransformers, Fig. 21-23). The total path length of the eddy currents is confined\nto each slab, which increases the total resistance; hence the current is less and\nthere is less wasted energy.\nWalk-through metal detectors (Fig. 21-21) use electromagnetic induction and\neddy currents to detect metal objects. Several coils are situated in the walls of the\nwalk-through at different heights. In one technique, the coils are given brief pulses\nof current, hundreds or thousands of times per second. When a person passes\nthrough the walk-through, any metal object being carried will have eddy currents\ninduced in it, and the small magnetic field produced by that eddy current can be\ndetected, setting off an alert or alarm.\n21-7 Transformers and\nTransmission of Power\nFIGURE 21-21 Metal detector.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nMetal detector\nA transformer is a device for increasing or decreasing an ac voltage. Transformers\nare found everywhere: on utility poles (Fig. 21-22) to reduce the high voltage from\nthe electric company to a usable voltage in houses (120 V or 240 V), in chargers for\ncell phones, laptops, and other electrical devices, in your car to give the needed\nhigh voltage to the spark plugs, and in many other applications. A transformer\nconsists of two coils of wire known as the primary and secondary coils. The\ntwo coils can be interwoven (with insulated wire); or they can be linked by an\niron core which is laminated to minimize eddy-current losses (Section 21-6),\nas shown in Fig. 21-23. Transformers are designed so that (nearly) all the mag-\nnetic flux produced by the current in the primary coil also passes through\nthe secondary coil, and we assume this is true in what follows. We also\nassume that energy losses (in resistance and hysteresis) can be ignored-a good\napproximation for real transformers, which are often better than 99% efficient.\nWhen an ac voltage is applied to the primary coil, the changing magnetic\nfield it produces will induce an ac voltage of the same frequency in the secondary\ncoil. However, the voltage will be different according to the number of "turns" or\nloops in each coil. From Faraday\'s law, the voltage or emf induced in the\nsecondary coil is\nFIGURE 21-22 Repairing a step-\ndown transformer on a utility pole.\nVs = Ns\nAt\n,\nwhere Ns is the number of turns in the secondary coil, and A@B/ At is the rate at\nwhich the magnetic flux changes.\nThe input primary voltage, Vp, is related to the rate at which the flux changes\nthrough it,\nVp = Np\nAPB\n,\nAt\nwhere Np is the number of turns in the primary coil. This follows because the\nchanging flux produces a back emf, Np A@B/At, in the primary that balances\nthe applied voltage Vp if the resistance of the primary can be ignored (Kirchhoff\'s\nrules). We divide these two equations, assuming little or no flux is lost, to find\nVs\nNs\nVp Np\n(21-6)\nThis transformer equation tells how the secondary (output) voltage is related to\nthe primary (input) voltage; Vs and Vp in Eq. 21-6 can be the rms values\n(Section 18-7) for both, or peak values for both.

For example, if the secondary coil has twice as many turns as the primary\ncoil, then the secondary voltage will be twice that of the primary voltage. If Ns is\nless than Np, we have a step-down transformer.\nAlthough ac voltage can be increased (or decreased) with a transformer, we\ndon\'t get something for nothing. Energy conservation tells us that the power\noutput can be no greater than the power input. A well-designed transformer can\nbe greater than 99% efficient, so little energy is lost to heat.

There is 100% efficiency in power\ntransfer for our ideal transformer.\nEXERCISE E How many turns would you want in the secondary coil of a transformer\nhaving Np = 400 turns if it were to reduce the voltage from 120-V ac to 3.0-V ac?\nA transformer operates only on ac. A de current in the primary coil does not\nproduce a changing flux and therefore induces no emf in the secondary. How-\never, if a dc voltage is applied to the primary through a switch, at the instant the\nswitch is opened or closed there will be an induced voltage in the secondary. For\nexample, if the dc is turned on and off as shown in Fig. 21-24a, the voltage\ninduced in the secondary is as shown in Fig. 21-24b. Notice that the secondary\nvoltage drops to zero when the dc voltage is steady. This is basically how, in the\nignition system of an automobile, the high voltage is created to produce the spark\nacross the gap of a spark plug that ignites the gas-air mixture. The transformer is\nreferred to as an "ignition coil," and transforms the 12 V dc of the battery (when\nswitched off in the primary) into a spike of as much as 30 kV in the secondary.\n602 CHAPTER 21 Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday\'s Law\n', 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': "High voltage\ntransmission line\nPower\nplant\n0.0.0\nStep-up\ntransformer\nStep-down\ntransformer\n(substation)\nStep-down\ntransformer\nHome\n12,000 V\n240,000 V\n7200 V 240 V\nFIGURE 21-25 The transmission of electric power from power plants to homes makes use of transformers\nat various stages.\nTransformers play an important role in the transmission of electricity. Power\nplants are often situated some distance from metropolitan areas, so electricity\nmust then be transmitted over long distances (Fig. 21-25). There is always some\npower loss in the transmission lines, and this loss can be minimized if the power is\ntransmitted at high voltage, using transformers, as the following Example shows.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nTransformers help power\ntransmission\nEXAMPLE 21-11\nTransmission lines. An average of 120 kW of electric\npower is sent to a small town from a power plant 10 km away. The transmission\nlines have a total resistance of 0.40 0. Calculate the power loss if the power is\ntransmitted at (a) 240 V and (b) 24,000 V.\nAPPROACH We cannot use P = V2/R because if R is the resistance of the\ntransmission lines, we don't know the voltage drop along them. The given voltages\nare applied across the lines plus the load (the town). But we can determine the\ncurrent I in the lines (= P/V), and then find the power loss from PL = I2R, for\nboth cases (a) and (b).\nSOLUTION (a) If 120 KW is sent at 240 V, the total current will be\nI = P = 1.2 × 105 W\n2.4 × 102 V\n= 500 A.\nThe power loss in the lines, PL, is then\nPL = 12R = (500 A)2(0.40 (2) = 100 kW.\nThus, over 80% of all the power would be wasted as heat in the power lines!\n(b) If 120 kW is sent at 24,000 V, the total current will be\n1.2 × 105 W\nI = V = 2.4 X 104 V\n= 5.0 A.\nThe power loss in the lines is then\nPL = 12R = (5.0A)2(0.40 () = 10W,\nwhich is less than 100 of 1%: a far better efficiency.\nNOTE We see that the higher voltage results in less current, and thus less\npower is wasted as heat in the transmission lines. It is for this reason that power\nis usually transmitted at very high voltages, as high as 700 kV.\nThe great advantage of ac, and a major reason it is in nearly universal use+, is\nthat the voltage can easily be stepped up or down by a transformer. The output\nvoltage of an electric generating plant is stepped up prior to transmission. Upon\narrival in a city, it is stepped down in stages at electric substations prior to distri-\nbution. The voltage in lines along city streets is typically 2400 V or 7200 V and is\nstepped down to 240 V or 120 V for home use by transformers (Figs. 21-22 and 21-25).\n+DC transmission along wires does exist, and has some advantages (if the current is constant, there is\nno induced current in nearby conductors as there is with ac). But boosting to high voltage and down\nagain at the receiving end requires more complicated electronics.\nSECTION 21-7 Transformers and Transmission of Power 603\n", 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'PHYSICS APPLIED\nCharging phones,\ncars, etc., by\ninduction\nPrimary coil\n(in charger base)\n-d-\nSecondary coil\n(in toothbrush)\nI = Io sin 2wft\nFIGURE 21-26 This electric\ntoothbrush contains rechargeable\nbatteries which are being recharged\nas it sits on its base.

But devices can also be charged "wirelessly" by induction, with-\nout the need for exposed electric contacts. The electric toothbrush shown in\nFig. 21-26 sits on a plastic base. Inside the base is a "primary coil" connected to an\nac outlet. Inside the toothbrush is a "secondary coil" in which a current is induced\ndue to the changing magnetic field produced by the changing current in the primary\ncoil. The current induced in the secondary coil charges the rechargeable batteries.\n(Not an option for ordinary AA or AAA batteries which are not rechargeable.) The\neffect is like a transformer-except here there is no iron to contain the field lines, so\nthere is less efficiency. But you can separate the two parts (toothbrush and charger)\nand brush your teeth. Many heart pacemakers are given power inductively: power\nin an external coil is transmitted to a secondary coil in the pacemaker (Fig. 19-25)\ninside the person\'s body near the heart. Inductive charging is also a possible\nmeans for recharging an electric car\'s batteries.\nWireless transmission of power must be done over short distances to maintain\na reasonable efficiency. Wireless transmission of signals (information) can be done\nover great distances (Section 22-7) because even fairly low power signals can be\ndetected, and it is the information in the signal voltages that counts, not power.\n21-8 Information Storage: Magnetic and\nSemiconductor; Tape, Hard Drive, RAM\n* Magnetic Storage: Read/Write on Tape and Disks\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHard drive\nRecording and playback on tape or disk is done by magnetic heads. Magnetic\ntapes contain a thin layer of ferromagnetic oxide on a thin plastic tape. Computer\nhard drives (HD) store digital information (applications and data): they have a\nthin layer of ferromagnetic material on the surface of each rotating disk or platter,\nFig. 21-27a. During recording of an audio or video signal on tape, or "writing"\non a hard drive, the voltage is sent to the recording head which acts as a tiny\nelectromagnet (Fig. 21-27b) that magnetizes the tiny section of tape or disk pass-\ning the narrow gap in the head at each instant. During playback, or "reading" of\nan HD, the changing magnetism of the moving tape or disk at the gap causes\ncorresponding changes in the magnetic field within the soft-iron head, which in\nturn induces an emf in the coil (Faraday\'s law). This induced emf is the output\nsignal that can be processed by the computer, or for audio can be amplified and\nsent to a loudspeaker (for video to a monitor or TV).\nFIGURE 21-27 (a) Photo of a hard drive\nshowing several platters and read/write heads\nthat can quickly move from the edge of the\ndisk to the center. (b) Read/Write\n(playback/recording) head for disk or tape.\nIn writing or recording, the electric input signal\nto the head, which acts as an electromagnet,\nmagnetizes the passing tape or disk. In reading\nor playback, the changing magnetic field of the\npassing tape or disk induces a changing magnetic\nfield in the head, which in turn induces in the\ncoil an emf that is the output signal.\nElectric signal\ninput (or output)\nRead/Write\nhead\nCoil\nGap\nMoving magnetic tape\nor rotating disk\n(a)\n(b)\nAudio and video signals may be analog, varying continuously in amplitude over\ntime: the variation in degree of magnetization at sequential points reflects the varia-\ntion in amplitude and frequency of the audio or video signal. In modern equipment,\nanalog signals (say from a microphone) are electronically converted to digital-which\nmeans a series of bits, each of which is a "1" or a "0", that forms a binary code\nas discussed in Section 17-10. (Recall also, 8 bits in a row = 1 byte.)\nComputers process only digital information.\n604 CHAPTER 21\n', 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CD-ROMs, CDs (audio compact discs), and DVDs (digital video discs) are read\nby an optical drive (not magnetic): a laser emits a narrow beam of light that reflects\noff the "grooves" of the rotating disc containing "pits" as described in Section 28-11.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nCDs and DVDs\n*\nSemiconductor Memory: DRAM, Flash\nBasic to your computer is its random access memory (RAM). This is where the\ninformation you are working with at any given time is temporarily stored and\nmanipulated by you. Each data storage location can be accessed and read\n(or written) directly and quickly, so you don\'t have to wait. In contrast, hard\ndrives, tape, flash and external devices are more permanent storage, and they are\nmuch slower to access because the data must be searched for, sequentially, such\nas along the circular tracks of hard drives (Fig. 21-27a). Programs, applications,\nand data that you want to use are imported by the computer into the RAM from\ntheir more permanent (and more slowly accessed) storage area.+\nRAM is based on semiconductor technology, storing the binary bits ("0" or "1")\nas electric charge or voltage. Some computers may use semiconductors also for\nlong-term storage ("flash memory") in place of a hard drive.\nDrain\nA common type of RAM is dynamic random access memory or DRAM, which\nuses arrays of transistors known as MOSFETs (metal-oxide semiconductor\nfield-effect transistors). Transistors will be discussed in Section 29-10, but we\nalready encountered them in Section 17-11 about TV screen addressing, Fig. 17-34,\nwhich we show again here, Fig. 21-28. A MOSFET transistor in RAM serves\nbasically as an on-off switch: the voltage on the gate terminal acts to control the\nconductivity between the source and the drain terminals, thus allowing current\nto flow (or not) between them.\nGate\nSource\nFIGURE 21-28 Symbol for a\nMOSFET transistor. The gate acts\nto attract or repel charge, and thus\nopen or close the connection along\nthe semiconductor that connects\nsource and drain.\nEach memory "cell," which in DRAM consists of one transistor and a capacitor,\nstores one bit (= a "0" or a "1"). Each cell is extremely small physically, less than\n100 nm across .* Typical DRAM chips (integrated circuits) contain billions of\nthese memory cells. To see how they work, we look at a tiny part, the simple four-\ncell array shown in Fig. 21-29. One side of each cell capacitor is grounded; the\nother side is connected to the transistor source. The drain of each transistor is\nconnected to a very thin conducting wire or "line," a bit-line, that runs across the\narray of cells. Each gate is connected to a word-line. A particular bit is a "1" or\na "0" depending on whether the capacitor of the cell is charged to a voltage V\n(maybe 5 V) or is at zero (uncharged, or at a very small voltage).\nFIGURE 21-29 A tiny 2 × 2 cell,\npart of a simple DRAM array. The\nword-lines and bit-lines do not touch\neach other where they cross.\nTo write data, say on the upper left cell in Fig. 21-29, word-line-1 is given\na high enough pulse of voltage to "turn on" the transistor. That is, the high gate\nvoltage attracts charge and allows bit-line-1 and the capacitor to be connected. Thus\ncharge can flow from bit-line-1 to the capacitor, charging it either to V or to 0,\ndepending on the bit-line-1 voltage at that moment, thus writing a "1" or a "0".\nWord-line 1 Word-line 2\nBit-line 1\nC\nC\nThe lower left cell in Fig. 21-29 can be written at the same time by setting Bit-line 2\nbit-line-2 voltage to V or zero.\nNow let us see a simple way to read a cell. In order to read the data stored\n("1" or "0") on the upper left cell, a voltage of about 2 V is given to bit-line-1.\nThen word-line-1 is given enough voltage to turn on the transistor and connect\nbit-line-1 to the capacitor. The capacitor, if uncharged (= "0"), will now drag\ncharge from bit-line-1 and the bit-line voltage will drop below 2 V. If the capacitor\nis already charged to V (= "1"), the connection to bit-line-1 will raise bit-line-1\'s\nvoltage to above - V. A sensor at the end of bit-line-1 will detect either change in\nvoltage (increase means it reads a "1", decrease a "0"). All cells connected to one\nword-line are read at the same moment. The capacitor voltage has been altered\nby the small charge flow during the reading process. So that cell or bit which has\njust been read needs to be written again, or "refreshed."\nC\nHI\nC\n*Computer specifications may use "memory" for the random access (fast) memory, and "storage" for\nthe long-term (and slower access) information on hard drives, flash drives, and related devices.\n*At 100 nm, 105 bits can fit along a 1-cm line, (1 cm/100 nm) = 10-2 m/10-7m. So a square, 1 cm\non a side, can hold 105 × 105 = 1010 = 10 Gbits ~ 1 GB (gigabyte). Today, cells are even smaller\nthan 100 nm: a (30 nm)2 cell can hold ~ 10 GB in a 1 cm2 area.\n*SECTION 21-8 605\n', 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Floating gate\nDrain\nSemiconductor\nGate\nInsulator\nThin insulator Source\nFIGURE 21-30 A floating gate\nnonvolatile memory cell (NVM).\nThe transistors are imperfect switches and allow the charge on the tiny capac-\nitors in each cell to be "leaky" and lose charge fairly quickly, so every cell has to\nbe read and rewritten (refreshed) many times per second. The D in DRAM stands\nfor this "dynamic" refreshing action. If the power is turned off, the capacitors\nlose their charge and the data are lost. DRAM is thus referred to as being volatile\nmemory, whereas a hard drive keeps its (magnetic) memory even when the\nelectric power is off and is called nonvolatile memory (doesn\'t "evaporate").\nFlash memory is also made of semiconductor material on tiny "chips." The\ntransistor structures are more complicated, and are able to keep the data even\nwithout power so they are nonvolatile. Each MOSFET contains a second gate (the\nfloating gate) insulated on both faces, and can hold charge for many years.\nCharged or not corresponds to a "1" or a "0" bit. Figure 21-30 is a diagram of\nsuch an NVM (nonvolatile memory) cell. The floating gate is insulated from the\nstandard gate and the semiconductor connecting source and drain. A high posi-\ntive voltage on the gate (+20 V) forces electrons in the semiconductor (at 0 V) to\npass through the thin insulator into the floating gate by a process of quantum\nmechanical tunneling (discussed in Section 30-12). This charge is stored on the\nfloating gate as a "1" bit. The erase process is done by applying the opposite\n(-20 V) voltage to force electrons to tunnel out of the floating gate, returning it\nto the uncharged state (= a "0" bit). The erase process is slow (milliseconds vs. ns\nfor DRAM), so erasure is done in large blocks of memory. Flash memory+ is\nslower to read or write, and is too slow to use as RAM. Instead, flash memory\ncan be used in place of a hard drive as general storage in computers and tablets,\nand may be called a "solid state device" (SSD). Flash is also used for flash drives,\nmemory cards (such as SD cards), thumb drives, cell phone and portable player\nmemory, and external computer memory.\nMagnetoresistive RAM (MRAM) is a recent development, involving (again)\nmagnetic properties. One cell (storing one bit) consists of two tiny ferromagnetic\nplates (separated by an insulator), one of which is permanently magnetized.\nThe other plate can be magnetized in one direction or the other, for a "1" or\na "0", by current in nearby wires. Cell size is a bit large, but MRAM is fast and\nnonvolatile (no power and no refresh needed) and therefore has the potential to\nbe used as any type of memory.\nFIGURE 21-31 Diagram of a\nmicrophone that works by induction.\n*\n21-9 Applications of Induction:\nMicrophone, Seismograph, GFCI\n*\nMicrophone\nMembrane\nSmall coil of wire\nN\nS\nMagnet\nTo recorder or amplifier\nThe condenser microphone was discussed in Section 17-7.

As shown in\nFig. 21-33, the two conductors of a power line connected to an electric circuit or device\n(red) pass through a small iron ring. Around the ring are many loops of thin wire\nthat serve as a sensing coil. Under normal conditions (no ground fault), the current\nmoving in the hot power wire is exactly balanced by the returning current in the\nneutral wire. If something goes wrong and the hot wire touches the ungrounded\nmetal case of the device or appliance, some of the entering current can pass through\na person who touches the case and then to ground (a ground fault). Then the return\ncurrent in the neutral wire will be less than the entering current in the hot wire, so\nthere is a net current passing through the GFCI\'s iron ring. Because the current\nis ac, it is changing and that current difference produces a changing magnetic field\nin the iron, thus inducing an emf in the sensing coil wrapped around the iron. For\nexample, if a device draws 8.0 A, and there is a ground fault through a person of\n100 mA (= 0.1 A), then 7.9 A will appear in the neutral wire. The emf induced\nin the sensing coil by this 100-mA difference is amplified by a simple transistor\ncircuit and sent to its own solenoid circuit breaker that opens the circuit at the\nswitch S, thus protecting your life.\nIf the case of the faulty device is grounded, the difference in current is even\nhigher when there is a fault, and the GFCI trips very quickly.\nGFCIs can sense current differences as low as 5 mA and react in 1 ms, saving\nlives.

Mutual inductance\nhas units of V.s/A = Q.s, which is called the henry (H), after Joseph Henry:\n1H =12.s.\nThe mutual inductance M is a "constant" in that it does not depend on I1;\nM depends on "geometric" factors such as the size, shape, number of turns, and\nrelative positions of the two coils, and also on whether iron (or other ferromagnetic\nmaterial) is present. For example, the farther apart the two coils are in Fig. 21-35,\nthe fewer lines of flux can pass through coil 2, so M will be less.

This type has\nthe advantage over battery-powered pacemakers in that surgery is not needed to\nreplace a battery when it wears out.\n* Self-Inductance\nThe concept of inductance applies also to an isolated single coil. When a changing\ncurrent passes through a coil or solenoid, a changing magnetic flux is produced\ninside the coil, and this in turn induces an emf. This induced emf opposes the\nchange in flux (Lenz\'s law); it is much like the back emf generated in a motor.\n(For example, if the current through the coil is increasing, the increasing mag-\nnetic flux induces an emf that opposes the original current and tends to retard\nits increase.) The induced emf & is proportional to the rate of change in current\n(and is in the direction opposed to the change, hence the minus sign):\n8 = - LAI\nAt\n(21-9)\nThe constant of proportionality L is called the self-inductance, or simply the\ninductance of the coil. It, too, is measured in henrys. The magnitude of L depends\non the size and shape of the coil and on the presence of an iron core.\nAn ac circuit (Section 18-7) always contains some inductance, but often it is\nquite small unless the circuit contains a coil of many loops or turns.

Now we ask, what happens\nwhen a battery of voltage V0 is connected in series to such an LR circuit? At the\ninstant the switch connecting the battery is closed, the current starts to flow. It is\nopposed by the induced emf in the inductor because of the changing current.\nHowever, as soon as current starts to flow, there is a voltage drop across the\nresistance (V = IR). Hence, the voltage drop across the inductance is reduced\nand the current increases less rapidly. The current thus rises gradually, as shown\nin Fig. 21-38a, and approaches the steady value Io = Vo/R when there is no\nmore emf across the inductor (I is no longer changing) so all the voltage drop is\nacross the resistance.

Figure 21-39b shows the voltage (red curve)\nand the current (blue curve) as a function of time. Because the current is zero\nwhen the voltage is zero and the current reaches a peak when the voltage does,\nwe say that the current and voltage are in phase.

We ignore any resistance it might have (it is usually small). The voltage\napplied to the inductor will be equal to the "back" emf generated in the inductor\nby the changing current as given by Eq. 21-9. This is because the sum of the elec-\ntric potential changes around any closed circuit must add up to zero, by Kirchhoff\'s\nrule. Thus\nV - LA = 0\nAt\nor\nAI\nV\nAt\nL\nwhere V is the sinusoidally varying voltage of the source and L AI/ At is the voltage\ninduced in the inductor. According to the last equation, I is increasing most\nrapidly when V has its maximum value, V = V0 . And I will be decreasing most\nrapidly when V = - Vo. These two instants correspond to points d and b on the\ngraph of voltage versus time in Fig. 21-40b. By going point by point in this manner,\nthe curve of V versus t as compared to that for I versus t can be constructed, and\nthey are shown by the blue and red lines, respectively, in Fig. 21-40b.

A capacitor\nprevents the flow of a de current. But if a capacitor is connected to an alternating\nsource of voltage, as in Fig. 21-41a, an alternating current will flow continuously.\nThis can happen because when the ac voltage is first turned on, charge begins\nto flow and one plate acquires a negative charge and the other a positive charge.\nBut when the voltage reverses itself, the charges flow in the opposite direction.\nThus, for an alternating applied voltage, an ac current is present in the circuit\ncontinuously.\nFIGURE 21-41 (a) Capacitor\nconnected to an ac source.\n(b) Current leads voltage by\na quarter cycle, or 90°.\nV0\nI0\nV\nI\nV\n0\nt\na b\nc\nd\nC\nI\n2\nI = Lo cos 2n ft\nV = Vo sin 21 ft\n(a)\n(b)\nCAUTION\nOnly resistance dissipates\nenergy\nThe applied voltage must equal the voltage across the capacitor: V = Q/C,\nwhere C is the capacitance and Q the charge on the plates. Thus the charge Q on\nthe plates is in phase with the voltage. But what about the current I? At point a in\nFig. 21-41b, when the voltage is zero and starts increasing, the charge on the plates\nis zero. Thus charge flows readily toward the plates and the current I is large.\nAs the voltage approaches its maximum of Vo (point b in Fig. 21-41b), the charge\nthat has accumulated on the plates tends to prevent more charge from flowing, so\nthe current I drops to zero at point b. Thus the current follows the blue curve in\nFig. 21-41b. Like an inductor, the voltage and current are out of phase by 90°.\nBut for a capacitor, the current reaches its peaks ¿ cycle before the voltage does,\nso we say that the\ncurrent leads the voltage by 90° for a capacitor.\nBecause the current and voltage are out of phase, the average power dissipated is\nzero, just as for an inductor.

We choose our origin\nin time (t = 0) so that the current I at any time t is\nI = Lo cos 2mft.\nAC circuits are complicated to analyze. The easiest approach is to use a sort\nof vector device known as a phasor diagram. Arrows (treated like vectors) are\ndrawn in an xy coordinate system to represent each voltage. The length of each\narrow represents the magnitude of the peak voltage across each element:\nVR0 = I0 R,\nVL0 = I0XL ,\nand\nVco = Io Xc.\n(21-13b)\nVR0 is in phase with the current and is initially (t = 0) drawn along the positive\nx axis, as is the current I0 . VL0 leads the current by 90°, so it leads VR0 by 90° and\nis initially drawn along the positive y axis. Vco lags the current by 90°, so Vco is\ndrawn initially along the negative y axis. See Fig. 21-44a. If we let the vector\ndiagram rotate counterclockwise at frequency f, we get the diagram shown in\nFig. 21-44b; after a time, t, each arrow has rotated through an angle 2mft. Then\nthe projections of each arrow on the x axis represent the voltages across each\nelement at the instant t, as can be seen in Fig. 21-44c. For example I = Io cos 2mft.\nThe sum of the projections of the three voltage vectors represents the instanta-\nneous voltage across the whole circuit, V. Therefore, the vector sum of these\nvectors will be the vector that represents the peak source voltage, V0 , as shown\nin Fig. 21-45 where it is seen that Vo makes an angle ø with Io and VRO . As time\npasses, V0 rotates with the other vectors, so the instantaneous voltage V (projec-\ntion of Vo on the x axis) is (see Fig. 21-45)\nV= Vocos(2mft+ ¢).\nThe voltage V across the whole circuit must equal the source voltage (Fig. 21-43).\nThus the voltage from the source is out of phase with the current by an angle o.\nFrom this analysis we can now determine the total impedance Z of the\ncircuit, which is defined in analogy to resistance and reactance as\n(21-14)\nVrms = Irms Z,\nor\nVo = IZ.\nx\nFrom Fig. 21-45 we see, using the Pythagorean theorem (Vo is the hypotenuse of a\n614 CHAPTER 21 Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law\n", 'chapter_title': "Electromagnetic Induction and Faraday's Law"}, {'page_number': 26, 'type': 'text', 'content': "right triangle), that (use Eq. 21-13b)\nVO = V VRO + (VLO - Vco)2\n= LOV R2 + (XL - Xc)2.\nThus, from Eq. 21-14, the total impedance Z is\nZ = V R2 + (XL - Xc)2.\n(21-15)\nAlso from Fig. 21-45, we can find the phase angle ø between voltage and current:\ntan ø\n=\nVL0 - VC0\nXL - Xc\n=\nIo(XL - Xc)\n=\nVR0\nI0 R\nR\n(21-16a)\ncos ₲ =\nV0\nand\nVR0\nIR\n= R.\n(21-16b)\n= =\nIZ\nZ\nFigure 21-45 was drawn for the case XL > Xc, and the current lags the source\nvoltage by ø.

From Eq. 21-18\nwe see that the current will be maximum at a frequency that satisfies\n2TfL -\n2TTfC\n= 0.\n1\nWe solve this for f, and call the solution f0 :\nf 0 =\n1\n2TT VLC\n1\n[resonance] (21-19)\nWhen f = f0 , the circuit is in resonance, and f0 is the resonant frequency of the\ncircuit. At this frequency, Xc = XL, so the impedance is purely resistive. A graph\nof Irms versus f is shown in Fig. 21-46 for particular values of R, L, and C. For\nsmaller R compared to XL and Xc, the resonance peak will be higher and sharper.\nWhen R is very small, we speak of an LC circuit. The energy in an LC circuit\noscillates, at frequency f0 , between the inductor and the capacitor, with some being\ndissipated in R (some resistance is unavoidable). This is called an LC oscillation\nor an electromagnetic oscillation. Not only does the charge oscillate back and forth,\nbut so does the energy, which oscillates between being stored in the electric field\nof the capacitor and in the magnetic field of the inductor.\nElectric resonance is used in many circuits. Radio and TV sets, for example,\nuse resonant circuits for tuning in a station. Many frequencies reach the circuit\nfrom the antenna, but a significant current flows only for frequencies at or near\nthe resonant frequency chosen (the station you want). Either L or C is variable\nso that different stations can be tuned in (more on this in Chapter 22).\nThe magnetic flux passing through a loop is equal to the prod-\nuct of the area of the loop times the perpendicular component\nof the magnetic field:\nФв = BLA = BA cos 0.\n(21-1)\nIf the magnetic flux through a coil of wire changes in time,\nan emf is induced in the coil.

Its operation is based on Faraday's law: a coil\nof wire is made to rotate uniformly by mechanical means in a\nmagnetic field, and the changing flux through the coil induces\na sinusoidal current, which is the output of the generator.\nA motor, which operates in the reverse of a generator, acts\nlike a generator in that a back emf is induced in its rotating coil.\nBecause this back emf opposes the input voltage, it can act to\nlimit the current in a motor coil.
