It deals with the behavior and\nstructure of matter. The field of physics is usually divided into classical\nphysics which includes motion, fluids, heat, sound, light, electricity, and\nmagnetism; and modern physics which includes the topics of relativity, atomic\nstructure, quantum theory, condensed matter, nuclear physics, elementary particles, and\ncosmology and astrophysics. We will cover all these topics in this book, beginning\nwith motion (or mechanics, as it is often called) and ending with the most recent\nresults in fundamental particles and the cosmos. But before we begin on the\nphysics itself, we take a brief look at how this overall activity called "science,"\nincluding physics, is actually practiced.\n1-1 The Nature of Science\nThe principal aim of all sciences, including physics, is generally considered to be\nthe search for order in our observations of the world around us. Many people\nthink that science is a mechanical process of collecting facts and devising\ntheories. But it is not so simple. Science is a creative activity that in many\nrespects resembles other creative activities of the human mind.\nOne important aspect of science is observation of events, which includes\nthe design and carrying out of experiments. But observation and experiments\nrequire imagination, because scientists can never include everything in a\ndescription of what they observe. Hence, scientists must make judgments about\nwhat is relevant in their observations and experiments.\nConsider, for example, how two great minds, Aristotle (384-322 B.C .;\nFig. 1-1) and Galileo (1564-1642; Fig. 2-18), interpreted motion along a hori-\nzontal surface. Aristotle noted that objects given an initial push along the ground\n(or on a tabletop) always slow down and stop. Consequently, Aristotle argued,\nthe natural state of an object is to be at rest. Galileo, the first true experimen-\ntalist, reexamined horizontal motion in the 1600s. He imagined that if friction\ncould be eliminated, an object given an initial push along a horizontal surface\nwould continue to move indefinitely without stopping. He concluded that for an\nobject to be in motion was just as natural as for it to be at rest. By inventing a\nnew way of thinking about the same data, Galileo founded our modern view of\nmotion (Chapters 2, 3, and 4), and he did so with a leap of the imagination.\nGalileo made this leap conceptually, without actually eliminating friction.\n2 CHAPTER 1 Introduction, Measurement, Estimating\n', 'chapter_title': 'Introduction, Measurement, Estimating'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Observation, with careful experimentation and measurement, is one side of\nthe scientific process. The other side is the invention or creation of theories to\nexplain and order the observations. Theories are never derived directly from\nobservations. Observations may help inspire a theory, and theories are accepted\nor rejected based on the results of observation and experiment.\nTheories are inspirations that come from the minds of human beings. For\nexample, the idea that matter is made up of atoms (the atomic theory) was not\narrived at by direct observation of atoms-we can\'t see atoms directly. Rather,\nthe idea sprang from creative minds. The theory of relativity, the electromag-\nnetic theory of light, and Newton\'s law of universal gravitation were likewise\nthe result of human imagination.\nThe great theories of science may be compared, as creative achievements,\nwith great works of art or literature. But how does science differ from these\nother creative activities? One important difference is that science requires\ntesting of its ideas or theories to see if their predictions are borne out by exper-\niment. But theories are not "proved" by testing. First of all, no measuring\ninstrument is perfect, so exact confirmation is not possible. Furthermore, it is\nnot possible to test a theory for every possible set of circumstances. Hence a\ntheory cannot be absolutely verified. Indeed, the history of science tells us that\nlong-held theories can sometimes be replaced by new ones, particularly when\nnew experimental techniques provide new or contradictory data.\nA new theory is accepted by scientists in some cases because its predictions\nare quantitatively in better agreement with experiment than those of the older\ntheory. But in many cases, a new theory is accepted only if it explains a greater\nrange of phenomena than does the older one. Copernicus\'s Sun-centered theory\nof the universe (Fig. 1-2b), for example, was originally no more accurate than\nPtolemy\'s Earth-centered theory (Fig. 1-2a) for predicting the motion of heav-\nenly bodies (Sun, Moon, planets). But Copernicus\'s theory had consequences\nthat Ptolemy\'s did not, such as predicting the moonlike phases of Venus. A\nsimpler and richer theory, one which unifies and explains a greater variety of\nphenomena, is more useful and beautiful to a scientist. And this aspect, as well\nas quantitative agreement, plays a major role in the acceptance of a theory.\nFIGURE 1-2 (a) Ptolemy\'s geocentric view of the universe. Note at the center the four elements of the\nancients: Earth, water, air (clouds around the Earth), and fire; then the circles, with symbols, for the Moon,\nMercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the fixed stars, and the signs of the zodiac.

For example, Einstein\'s theory of relativity\ngives predictions that differ very little from the older theories of Galileo and\nNewton in nearly all everyday situations. Its predictions are better mainly in the\nextreme case of very high speeds close to the speed of light. But quantitative\nprediction is not the only important outcome of a theory. Our view of the world\nis affected as well. As a result of Einstein\'s theory of relativity, for example, our\nconcepts of space and time have been completely altered, and we have come to\nsee mass and energy as a single entity (via the famous equation E = mc2).\n1-2 Physics and its Relation to\nOther Fields\nFor a long time science was more or less a united whole known as natural\nphilosophy. Not until a century or two ago did the distinctions between physics\nand chemistry and even the life sciences become prominent. Indeed, the sharp\ndistinction we now see between the arts and the sciences is itself only a few\ncenturies old. It is no wonder then that the development of physics has both\ninfluenced and been influenced by other fields. For example, the notebooks\n(Fig. 1-3) of Leonardo da Vinci, the great Renaissance artist, researcher, and\nengineer, contain the first references to the forces acting within a structure, a\nsubject we consider as physics today; but then, as now, it has great relevance to\narchitecture and building.\nEarly work in electricity that led to the discovery of the electric battery and\nelectric current was done by an eighteenth-century physiologist, Luigi Galvani\n(1737-1798). He noticed the twitching of frogs\' legs in response to an electric spark\nand later that the muscles twitched when in contact with two dissimilar metals\n(Chapter 18). At first this phenomenon was known as "animal electricity," but it\nshortly became clear that electric current itself could exist in the absence of an animal.\nPhysics is used in many fields. A zoologist, for example, may find physics useful\nin understanding how prairie dogs and other animals can live underground without\nsuffocating. A physical therapist will be more effective if aware of the principles\nof center of gravity and the action of forces within the human body. A know-\nledge of the operating principles of optical and electronic equipment is helpful in a\nvariety of fields. Life scientists and architects alike will be interested in the nature\nof heat loss and gain in human beings and the resulting comfort or discomfort.\nArchitects may have to calculate the dimensions of the pipes in a heating system\nor the forces involved in a given structure to determine if it will remain standing\n(Fig. 1-4). They must know physics principles in order to make realistic designs\nand to communicate effectively with engineering consultants and other specialists.\nFIGURE 1-4 (a) This bridge over the River Tiber in Rome was built 2000 years ago and still stands.\n(b) The 2007 collapse of a Mississippi River highway bridge built only 40 years before.\n(a)\n(b)\n4 CHAPTER 1 Introduction, Measurement, Estimating\n', 'chapter_title': 'Introduction, Measurement, Estimating'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'From the aesthetic or psychological point of view, too, architects must be\naware of the forces involved in a structure-for example instability, even if only\nillusory, can be discomforting to those who must live or work in the structure.\nThe list of ways in which physics relates to other fields is extensive. In the\nChapters that follow we will discuss many such applications as we carry out our\nprincipal aim of explaining basic physics.\n1-3 Models, Theories, and Laws\nWhen scientists are trying to understand a particular set of phenomena, they often\nmake use of a model. A model, in the scientific sense, is a kind of analogy or\nmental image of the phenomena in terms of something else we are already familiar\nwith. One example is the wave model of light. We cannot see waves of light as we\ncan water waves. But it is valuable to think of light as made up of waves, because\nexperiments indicate that light behaves in many respects as water waves do.\nThe purpose of a model is to give us an approximate mental or visual\npicture-something to hold on to-when we cannot see what actually is\nhappening. Models often give us a deeper understanding: the analogy to a known\nsystem (for instance, the water waves above) can suggest new experiments to\nperform and can provide ideas about what other related phenomena might\noccur.\nYou may wonder what the difference is between a theory and a model.\nUsually a model is relatively simple and provides a structural similarity to the\nphenomena being studied. A theory is broader, more detailed, and can give\nquantitatively testable predictions, often with great precision. It is important, how-\never, not to confuse a model or a theory with the real system or the phenomena\nthemselves.\nScientists have given the title law to certain concise but general statements\nabout how nature behaves (that electric charge is conserved, for example).\nOften the statement takes the form of a relationship or equation between\nquantities (such as Newton\'s second law, F = ma).\nStatements that we call laws are usually experimentally valid over a wide\nrange of observed phenomena. For less general statements, the term principle\nis often used (such as Archimedes\' principle). We use "theory" for a more\ngeneral picture of the phenomena dealt with.\nScientific laws are different from political laws in that the latter are prescrip-\ntive: they tell us how we ought to behave. Scientific laws are descriptive: they do\nnot say how nature should behave, but rather are meant to describe how nature\ndoes behave. As with theories, laws cannot be tested in the infinite variety of\ncases possible. So we cannot be sure that any law is absolutely true. We use the\nterm "law" when its validity has been tested over a wide range of cases, and\nwhen any limitations and the range of validity are clearly understood.\nScientists normally do their research as if the accepted laws and theories\nwere true. But they are obliged to keep an open mind in case new information\nshould alter the validity of any given law or theory.\n1-4 Measurement and Uncertainty;\nSignificant Figures\nIn the quest to understand the world around us, scientists seek to find relation-\nships among physical quantities that can be measured.\nUncertainty\nReliable measurements are an important part of physics. But no measurement is\nabsolutely precise. There is an uncertainty associated with every measurement.\nSECTION 1-4 Measurement and Uncertainty; Significant Figures 5\n', 'chapter_title': 'Introduction, Measurement, Estimating'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': '2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n9\n10\n6\n11\nFIGURE 1-5 Measuring the width\nof a board with a centimeter ruler.\nAccuracy is about # 1 mm.\nAmong the most important sources of uncertainty, other than blunders, are the\nlimited accuracy of every measuring instrument and the inability to read an\ninstrument beyond some fraction of the smallest division shown. For example,\nif you were to use a centimeter ruler to measure the width of a board (Fig. 1-5),\nthe result could be claimed to be precise to about 0.1 cm (1 mm), the smallest\ndivision on the ruler, although half of this value might be a valid claim as well.\nThe reason is that it is difficult for the observer to estimate (or "interpolate")\nbetween the smallest divisions. Furthermore, the ruler itself may not have been\nmanufactured to an accuracy very much better than this.\nWhen giving the result of a measurement, it is important to state the\nestimated uncertainty in the measurement. For example, the width of a board\nmight be written as 8.8 + 0.1 cm. The + 0.1 cm ("plus or minus 0.1 cm") repre-\nsents the estimated uncertainty in the measurement, so that the actual width\nmost likely lies between 8.7 and 8.9 cm. The percent uncertainty is the ratio of\nthe uncertainty to the measured value, multiplied by 100. For example, if the\nmeasurement is 8.8 cm and the uncertainty about 0.1 cm, the percent uncertainty is\n0.1\n8.8\n× 100% ~ 1%,\nwhere ~ means "is approximately equal to."\nOften the uncertainty in a measured value is not specified explicitly. In such\ncases, the\nuncertainty in a numerical value is assumed to be one or a few units in the\nlast digit specified.\nFor example, if a length is given as 8.8 cm, the uncertainty is assumed to be\nabout 0.1 cm or 0.2 cm, or possibly even 0.3 cm. It is important in this case that\nyou do not write 8.80 cm, because this implies an uncertainty on the order of\n0.01 cm; it assumes that the length is probably between about 8.79 cm and\n8.81 cm, when actually you believe it is between about 8.7 and 8.9 cm.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 1-1\nIs the diamond yours? A friend asks to\nborrow your precious diamond for a day to show her family. You are a bit\nworried, so you carefully have your diamond weighed on a scale which reads\n8.17 grams. The scale\'s accuracy is claimed to be + 0.05 gram. The next day you\nweigh the returned diamond again, getting 8.09 grams. Is this your diamond?\nRESPONSE The scale readings are measurements and are not perfect. They\ndo not necessarily give the "true" value of the mass. Each measurement could\nhave been high or low by up to 0.05 gram or so. The actual mass of your\ndiamond lies most likely between 8.12 grams and 8.22 grams. The actual mass\nof the returned diamond is most likely between 8.04 grams and 8.14 grams.\nThese two ranges overlap, so the data do not give you a strong reason to\ndoubt that the returned diamond is yours.\nSignificant Figures\nThe number of reliably known digits in a number is called the number of\nsignificant figures. Thus there are four significant figures in the number 23.21 cm\nand two in the number 0.062 cm (the zeros in the latter are merely place holders\nthat show where the decimal point goes). The number of significant figures may not\nalways be clear. Take, for example, the number 80. Are there one or two signifi-\ncant figures? We need words here: If we say it is roughly 80 km between two\ncities, there is only one significant figure (the 8) since the zero is merely a place\nholder. If there is no suggestion that the 80 is a rough approximation, then we\ncan often assume (as we will in this book) that it has 2 significant figures: so it is\n80 km within an accuracy of about 1 or 2 km. If it is precisely 80 km, to within\n+ 0.1 or + 0.2 km, then we write 80.0 km (three significant figures).\n6 CHAPTER 1 Introduction, Measurement, Estimating\n', 'chapter_title': 'Introduction, Measurement, Estimating'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'When specifying numerical results, you should avoid the temptation to keep\nmore digits in the final answer than is justified: see boldface statement on previous\npage. For example, to calculate the area of a rectangle 11.3 cm by 6.8 cm, the result of\nmultiplication would be 76.84 cm2. But this answer can not be accurate to the implied\n0.01 cm2 uncertainty, because (using the outer limits of the assumed uncertainty for\neach measurement) the result could be between 11.2 cm × 6.7 cm = 75.04 cm2 and\n11.4 cm × 6.9 cm = 78.66 cm2. At best, we can quote the answer as 77 cm2, which\nimplies an uncertainty of about 1 or 2 cm2. The other two digits (in the number\n76.84 cm2) must be dropped (rounded off) because they are not significant. As a\nrough general "significant figure" rule we can say that\nthe final result of a multiplication or division should have no more digits than\nthe numerical value with the fewest significant figures.\nIn our example, 6.8 cm has the least number of significant figures, namely two. Thus\nthe result 76.84 cm2 needs to be rounded off to 77 cm2.\nATAT\nDeg\n1:10 PM\n0.666666666\nLan\nsinh\nCash\nLanh\n1\nEL\nEXERCISE A The area of a rectangle 4.5 cm by 3.25 cm is correctly given by (a) 14.625 cm2;\n(b) 14.63 cm2; (c) 14.6 cm2; (d) 15 cm2.\n(a)\nWhen adding or subtracting numbers, the final result should contain no more\ndecimal places than the number with the fewest decimal places. For example, the\nresult of subtracting 0.57 from 3.6 is 3.0 (not 3.03). Similarly 36 + 8.2 = 44, not 44.2.\nBe careful not to confuse significant figures with the number of decimal places.\nEXERCISE B For each of the following numbers, state the number of significant\nfigures and the number of decimal places: (a) 1.23; (b) 0.123; (c) 0.0123.\nKeep in mind when you use a calculator that all the digits it produces may\nnot be significant. When you divide 2.0 by 3.0, the proper answer is 0.67, and\nnot 0.666666666 as calculators give (Fig. 1-6a). Digits should not be quoted in a\nresult unless they are truly significant figures. However, to obtain the most\naccurate result, you should normally keep one or more extra significant figures\nthroughout a calculation, and round off only in the final result. (With a calcu-\nlator, you can keep all its digits in intermediate results.) Note also that\ncalculators sometimes give too few significant figures. For example, when you\nmultiply 2.5 × 3.2, a calculator may give the answer as simply 8. But the answer is\naccurate to two significant figures, so the proper answer is 8.0. See Fig. 1-6b.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 1-2\nSignificant figures. Using a protractor\n(Fig. 1-7), you measure an angle to be 30°. (a) How many significant figures\nshould you quote in this measurement?

(b) If you\nenter cos 30° in your calculator, you will get a number like 0.866025403.\nBut the angle you entered is known only to two significant figures, so its cosine\nis correctly given by 0.87; you must round your answer to two significant figures.\nNOTE Trigonometric functions, like cosine, are reviewed in Chapter 3 and Appendix A.\nScientific Notation\nWe commonly write numbers in "powers of ten," or "scientific" notation-for\ninstance 36,900 as 3.69 × 104, or 0.0021 as 2.1 × 10-3. One advantage of\nscientific notation (reviewed in Appendix A) is that it allows the number of\nsignificant figures to be clearly expressed. For example, it is not clear whether\n36,900 has three, four, or five significant figures. With powers of 10 notation\nthe ambiguity can be avoided: if the number is known to three significant\nfigures, we write 3.69 × 104, but if it is known to four, we write 3.690 × 104.\nEXERCISE C Write each of the following in scientific notation and state the number of\nsignificant figures for each: (a) 0.0258; (b) 42,300; (c) 344.50.\n40\n30\n150\n26\n160\n170 180\n10\nM-276\nSECTION 1-4 Measurement and Uncertainty; Significant Figures 7\n', 'chapter_title': 'Introduction, Measurement, Estimating'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': '* Percent Uncertainty vs. Significant Figures\nThe significant figures rule is only approximate, and in some cases may under-\nestimate the accuracy (or uncertainty) of the answer. Suppose for example we\ndivide 97 by 92:\n97\n92\n= 1.05 ~ 1.1.\nBoth 97 and 92 have two significant figures, so the rule says to give the answer\nas 1.1. Yet the numbers 97 and 92 both imply an uncertainty of + 1 if no other\nuncertainty is stated. Both 92 + 1 and 97 + 1 imply an uncertainty of\nabout 1% (1/92 ~ 0.01 = 1%). But the final result to two significant figures\nis 1.1, with an implied uncertainty of + 0.1, which is an uncertainty of about 10%\n(0.1/1.1 ~ 0.1 ~ 10%). It is better in this case to give the answer as 1.05 (which\nis three significant figures). Why? Because 1.05 implies an uncertainty of + 0.01\nwhich is 0.01/1.05 ~ 0.01 ~ 1%, just like the uncertainty in the original\nnumbers 92 and 97.\nSUGGESTION: Use the significant figures rule, but consider the % uncertainty\ntoo, and add an extra digit if it gives a more realistic estimate of uncertainty.\nApproximations\nMuch of physics involves approximations, often because we do not have the\nmeans to solve a problem precisely. For example, we may choose to ignore air\nresistance or friction in doing a Problem even though they are present in the\nreal world, and then our calculation is only an approximation. In doing Problems,\nwe should be aware of what approximations we are making, and be aware\nthat the precision of our answer may not be nearly as good as the number of\nsignificant figures given in the result.\nAccuracy vs. Precision\nThere is a technical difference between "precision" and "accuracy." Precision in\na strict sense refers to the repeatability of the measurement using a given instru-\nment. For example, if you measure the width of a board many times, getting\nresults like 8.81 cm, 8.85 cm, 8.78 cm, 8.82 cm (interpolating between the 0.1 cm\nmarks as best as possible each time), you could say the measurements give a\nprecision a bit better than 0.1 cm. Accuracy refers to how close a measurement\nis to the true value. For example, if the ruler shown in Fig. 1-5 was manufac-\ntured with a 2% error, the accuracy of its measurement of the board\'s width\n(about 8.8 cm) would be about 2% of 8.8 cm or about + 0.2 cm. Estimated\nuncertainty is meant to take both accuracy and precision into account.\n1-5 Units, Standards, and\nthe SI System\nThe measurement of any quantity is made relative to a particular standard or unit,\nand this unit must be specified along with the numerical value of the quantity.\nFor example, we can measure length in British units such as inches,\nfeet, or miles, or in the metric system in centimeters, meters, or kilometers. To\nspecify that the length of a particular object is 18.6 is insufficient. The unit\nmust be given, because 18.6 meters is very different from 18.6 inches or\n18.6 millimeters.\nFor any unit we use, such as the meter for distance or the second for time,\nwe need to define a standard which defines exactly how long one meter or one\nsecond is. It is important that standards be chosen that are readily reproducible\nso that anyone needing to make a very accurate measurement can refer to the\nstandard in the laboratory and communicate with other people.\n8 CHAPTER 1 Introduction, Measurement, Estimating\n', 'chapter_title': 'Introduction, Measurement, Estimating'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Length\nThe first truly international standard was the meter (abbreviated m) established\nas the standard of length by the French Academy of Sciences in the 1790s. The\nstandard meter was originally chosen to be one ten-millionth of the distance\nfrom the Earth\'s equator to either pole,t and a platinum rod to represent this\nlength was made. (One meter is, very roughly, the distance from the tip of your\nnose to the tip of your finger, with arm and hand stretched out horizontally.) In\n1889, the meter was defined more precisely as the distance between two finely\nengraved marks on a particular bar of platinum-iridium alloy. In 1960, to\nprovide even greater precision and reproducibility, the meter was redefined as\n1,650,763.73 wavelengths of a particular orange light emitted by the gas\nkrypton-86. In 1983 the meter was again redefined, this time in terms of the\nspeed of light (whose best measured value in terms of the older definition of the\nmeter was 299,792,458 m/s, with an uncertainty of 1 m/s). The new definition\nreads: "The meter is the length of path traveled by light in vacuum during a\ntime interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second."*\nBritish units of length (inch, foot, mile) are now defined in terms of the\nmeter. The inch (in.) is defined as exactly 2.54 centimeters (cm; 1 cm = 0.01 m).\nOther conversion factors are given in the Table on the inside of the front cover\nof this book. Table 1-1 presents some typical lengths, from very small to very\nlarge, rounded off to the nearest power of 10. See also Fig. 1-8. [Note that the\nabbreviation for inches (in.) is the only one with a period, to distinguish it from\nthe word "in".]\nTime\nThe standard unit of time is the second (s). For many years, the second was\ndefined as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day (24 h/day × 60 min/h × 60 s/min =\n86,400 s/day).

The standard mass is a partic-\nular platinum-iridium cylinder, kept at the International Bureau of Weights\nand Measures near Paris, France, whose mass is defined as exactly 1 kg. A range\nof masses is presented in Table 1-3. [For practical purposes, 1 kg weighs about\n2.2 pounds on Earth.]\nWhen dealing with atoms and molecules, we usually use the unified atomic\nmass unit (u or amu). In terms of the kilogram,\n1 u = 1.6605 × 10-27 kg.\nPrecise values of this and other useful numbers are given on page A-72.\nThe definitions of other standard units for other quantities will be given as\nwe encounter them in later Chapters.\nUnit Prefixes\nIn the metric system, the larger and smaller units are defined in multiples of 10\nfrom the standard unit, and this makes calculation particularly easy. Thus\n1 kilometer (km) is 1000 m, 1 centimeter is 100 m, 1 millimeter (mm) is 1000 m or 10 cm,\nand so on. The prefixes "centi-," "kilo-," and others are listed in Table 1-4 and\ncan be applied not only to units of length but to units of volume, mass, or any\nother unit. For example, a centiliter (cL) is 100 liter (L), and a kilogram (kg) is\n1000 grams (g). An 8.2-megapixel camera has a detector with 8,200,000 pixels\n(individual "picture elements").\nIn common usage, 1 um (= 10-6 m) is called 1 micron.\nSystems of Units\nWhen dealing with the laws and equations of physics it is very important to use a\nconsistent set of units. Several systems of units have been in use over the years.\nToday the most important is the Système International (French for International\nSystem), which is abbreviated SI. In SI units, the standard of length is the meter,\nthe standard for time is the second, and the standard for mass is the kilogram.\nThis system used to be called the MKS (meter-kilogram-second) system.\nA second metric system is the cgs system, in which the centimeter, gram, and\nsecond are the standard units of length, mass, and time, as abbreviated in the title.\nThe British engineering system (although more used in the U.S. than Britain) has\nas its standards the foot for length, the pound for force, and the second for time.\nWe use SI units almost exclusively in this book.\n*\nPhysical quantities can be divided into two categories: base quantities and\nderived quantities. The corresponding units for these quantities are called base\nunits and derived units. A base quantity must be defined in terms of a standard.\nScientists, in the interest of simplicity, want the smallest number of base quanti-\nties possible consistent with a full description of the physical world. This\nnumber turns out to be seven, and those used in the SI are given in Table 1-5.\nBase vs. Derived Quantities\ntu is the Greek letter "mu."\nTABLE 1-5 SI Base Quantities and Units\nQuantity\nUnit\nUnit Abbreviation\nLength\nmeter\nm\nTime\nsecond\ns\nMass\nkilogram\nkg\nElectric current\nampere\nA\nTemperature\nkelvin\nK\nAmount of substance\nmole\nmol\nLuminous intensity\ncandela\ncd\n10 CHAPTER 1 Introduction, Measurement, Estimating\n', 'chapter_title': 'Introduction, Measurement, Estimating'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'All other quantities can be defined in terms of these seven base quantities,+ and\nhence are referred to as derived quantities. An example of a derived quantity is\nspeed, which is defined as distance divided by the time it takes to travel that\ndistance. A Table on page A-73 lists many derived quantities and their units in\nterms of base units. To define any quantity, whether base or derived, we can\nspecify a rule or procedure, and this is called an operational definition.\n1-6 Converting Units\nAny quantity we measure, such as a length, a speed, or an electric current,\nconsists of a number and a unit. Often we are given a quantity in one set of\nunits, but we want it expressed in another set of units. For example, suppose we\nmeasure that a shelf is 21.5 inches wide, and we want to express this in centi-\nmeters. We must use a conversion factor, which in this case is, by definition, exactly\n1 in. = 2.54 cm\nor, written another way,\n1 = 2.54 cm/in.\nSince multiplying by the number one does not change anything, the width of our\nshelf, in cm, is\n) × (2.54 Cm\nin.\n54.6 cm.\n21.5 inches = (21.5 T.) x\ncm\nNote how the units (inches in this case) cancelled out (thin red lines). A Table\ncontaining many unit conversions is found on page A-73. Let\'s consider some\nExamples.\nEXAMPLE 1-3\nThe 8000-m peaks. There are only 14 peaks whose sum-\nmits are over 8000 m above sea level. They are the tallest peaks in the\nworld (Fig. 1-9 and Table 1-6) and are referred to as "eight-thousanders."\nWhat is the elevation, in feet, of an elevation of 8000 m?\nAPPROACH We need to convert meters to feet, and we can start with the\nconversion factor 1 in. = 2.54 cm, which is exact. That is, 1 in. = 2.5400 cm\nto any number of significant figures, because it is defined to be.\nSOLUTION One foot is 12 in., so we can write\n1 ft = (12 in. ) 2.54\ncm\n= 30.48 cm = 0.3048 m,\nwhich is exact. Note how the units cancel (colored slashes). We can rewrite\nthis equation to find the number of feet in 1 meter:\n1 ft\n1 m =\n0.3048\n= 3.28084 ft.\n(We could carry the result to 6 significant figures because 0.3048 is exact,\n0.304800 ···. ) We multiply this equation by 8000.0 (to have five significant figures):\n8000.0 m = (8000.0 m ) 3.28084\nft\n= 26,247 ft.\nAn elevation of 8000 m is 26,247 ft above sea level.\nNOTE We could have done the unit conversions all in one line:\n8000.0 m = (8000.0 ₥)\n100 cm\n1 in.\n2.54 CmT\n1 ft\n26,247 ft.\n-\n1 m\n12 in.\nThe key is to multiply conversion factors, each equal to one (= 1.0000), and\nto make sure which units cancel.\n*Some exceptions are for angle (radians-see Chapter 8), solid angle (steradian), and sound level\n(bel or decibel, Chapter 12). No general agreement has been reached as to whether these are base\nor derived quantities.\nFIGURE 1-9 The world\'s second\nhighest peak, K2, whose summit is\nconsidered the most difficult of the\n"8000-ers."

You have seen a nice apartment whose\nfloor area is 880 square feet (ft2).

Why or why not?\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nUnit conversion is wrong if\nunits do not cancel\nWhen changing units, you can avoid making an error in the use of conver-\nsion factors by checking that units cancel out properly. For example, in our\nconversion of 1 mi to 1609 m in Example 1-5(a), if we had incorrectly used the\nfactor (100cm) instead of (100 cm), the centimeter units would not have cancelled\nout; we would not have ended up with meters.\n12 CHAPTER 1 Introduction, Measurement, Estimating\n', 'chapter_title': 'Introduction, Measurement, Estimating'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': '1-7 Order of Magnitude:\nRapid Estimating\nWe are sometimes interested only in an approximate value for a quantity. This\nmight be because an accurate calculation would take more time than it is worth\nor would require additional data that are not available. In other cases, we may\nwant to make a rough estimate in order to check a calculation made on a calcu-\nlator, to make sure that no blunders were made when the numbers were entered.\nA rough estimate can be made by rounding off all numbers to one significant\nfigure and its power of 10, and after the calculation is made, again keeping only\none significant figure. Such an estimate is called an order-of-magnitude estimate\nand can be accurate within a factor of 10, and often better. In fact, the phrase\n"order of magnitude" is sometimes used to refer simply to the power of 10.\nLet\'s do some Examples.\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nHow to make a rough estimate\nr = 500 m\n4\n10 m\n(b)\nFIGURE 1-10 Example 1-6. (a) How much water is in this\nlake? (Photo is one of the Rae Lakes in the Sierra Nevada\nof California.) (b) Model of the lake as a cylinder. [We could\ngo one step further and estimate the mass or weight of this\nlake. We will see later that water has a density of 1000 kg/m3,\nso this lake has a mass of about (103 kg/m3)(107 m3) ~ 1010 kg,\nwhich is about 10 billion kg or 10 million metric tons.\n(A metric ton is 1000 kg, about 2200 lb, slightly larger than a\nBritish ton, 2000 lb.)]\n(a)\nEXAMPLE 1-6\nESTIMATE\nVolume of a lake. Estimate how much water\nthere is in a particular lake, Fig. 1-10a, which is roughly circular, about 1 km\nacross, and you guess it has an average depth of about 10 m.\nAPPROACH No lake is a perfect circle, nor can lakes be expected to have a\nperfectly flat bottom. We are only estimating here. To estimate the volume,\nwe can use a simple model of the lake as a cylinder: we multiply the average\ndepth of the lake times its roughly circular surface area, as if the lake were a\ncylinder (Fig. 1-10b).\nSOLUTION The volume V of a cylinder is the product of its height h times\nthe area of its base: V = har2, where r is the radius of the circular base .* The\nradius r is 2 km = 500 m, so the volume is approximately\nV= hTr2~(10m) ×(3)×(5×102m)2 ~8×106m3 ~107m3,\nwhere IT was rounded off to 3. So the volume is on the order of 107 m3,\nten million cubic meters. Because of all the estimates that went into this\ncalculation, the order-of-magnitude estimate (107 m3) is probably better to\nquote than the 8 × 106 m3 figure.\nNOTE To express our result in U.S. gallons, we see in the Table on the inside\nfront cover that 1 liter = 10-3 m3 ~ 4 gallon. Hence, the lake contains\n(8 × 106 m3)(1 gallon/4 × 10-3 m3) ~ 2 × 109 gallons of water.\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nEstimating the volume (or mass) of\na lake; see also Fig. 1-10\n*Formulas like this for volume, area, etc., are found inside the back cover of this book.\nSECTION 1-7 Order of Magnitude: Rapid Estimating\nJ 13\n', 'chapter_title': 'Introduction, Measurement, Estimating'}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': '1\nThickness of a sheet of paper.

But we can use a trick or, to put it in\nphysics terms, make use of a symmetry: we can make the reasonable assump-\ntion that all the pages of this book are equal in thickness.\nSOLUTION We can use a ruler to measure hundreds of pages at once. If you\nmeasure the thickness of the first 500 pages of this book (page 1 to page 500),\nyou might get something like 1.5 cm. Note that 500 numbered pages, counted\nfront and back, is 250 separate pieces of paper. So one sheet must have a\nthickness of about\n250 sheets\n1.5 cm\n~ 6 × 10-3 cm = 6 × 10-2 mm,\nor less than a tenth of a millimeter (0.1 mm).\nIt cannot be emphasized enough how important it is to draw a diagram\nwhen solving a physics Problem, as the next Example shows.\nEXAMPLE 1-8\nESTIMATE\nHeight by triangulation. Estimate the height\nof the building shown in Fig. 1-12, by "triangulation," with the help of a bus-stop\npole and a friend.\nAPPROACH By standing your friend next to the pole, you estimate the height\nof the pole to be 3 m. You next step away from the pole until the top of the\npole is in line with the top of the building, Fig. 1-12a. You are 5 ft 6 in. tall, so\nyour eyes are about 1.5 m above the ground. Your friend is taller, and when\nshe stretches out her arms, one hand touches you, and the other touches the\npole, so you estimate that distance as 2 m (Fig. 1-12a). You then pace off the\ndistance from the pole to the base of the building with big, 1-m-long steps, and\nyou get a total of 16 steps or 16 m.\nSOLUTION Now you draw, to scale, the diagram shown in Fig. 1-12b using\nthese measurements. You can measure, right on the diagram, the last side of\nthe triangle to be about x = 13 m. Alternatively, you can use similar triangles\nto obtain the height x:\n1.5 m\n=\nx\n2 m\n18 m\nSO\nx ~ 132 m.\nFinally you add in your eye height of 1.5 m above the ground to get your final\nresult: the building is about 15 m tall.\nAnother approach, this one made famous by Enrico Fermi (1901-1954,\nFig. 1-13), was to show his students how to estimate the number of piano tuners in\na city, say, Chicago or San Francisco. To get a rough order-of-magnitude estimate\nof the number of piano tuners today in San Francisco, a city of about 800,000\ninhabitants, we can proceed by estimating the number of functioning pianos,\nhow often each piano is tuned, and how many pianos each tuner can tune. To\nestimate the number of pianos in San Francisco, we note that certainly not\neveryone has a piano. A guess of 1 family in 3 having a piano would corre-\nspond to 1 piano per 12 persons, assuming an average family of 4 persons.\n14 CHAPTER 1 Introduction, Measurement, Estimating\n', 'chapter_title': 'Introduction, Measurement, Estimating'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': "As an order of magnitude, let's say 1 piano per 10 people. This is certainly\nmore reasonable than 1 per 100 people, or 1 per every person, so let's\nproceed with the estimate that 1 person in 10 has a piano, or about\n80,000 pianos in San Francisco. Now a piano tuner needs an hour or two to\ntune a piano. So let's estimate that a tuner can tune 4 or 5 pianos a day. A piano\nought to be tuned every 6 months or a year-let's say once each year.\nA piano tuner tuning 4 pianos a day, 5 days a week, 50 weeks a year can tune about\n1000 pianos a year. So San Francisco, with its (very) roughly 80,000 pianos,\nneeds about 80 piano tuners. This is, of course, only a rough estimate.+ It tells\nus that there must be many more than 10 piano tuners, and surely not as many\nas 1000.\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nEstimating how many piano tuners\nthere are in a city\nA Harder Example-But Powerful\nEXAMPLE 1-9 |ESTIMATE\nEstimating the radius of Earth. Believe it or\nnot, you can estimate the radius of the Earth without having to go into space\n(see the photograph on page 1). If you have ever been on the shore of a large\nlake, you may have noticed that you cannot see the beaches, piers, or rocks at\nwater level across the lake on the opposite shore. The lake seems to bulge out\nbetween you and the opposite shore-a good clue that the Earth is round.\nSuppose you climb a stepladder and discover that when your eyes are 10 ft (3.0 m)\nabove the water, you can just see the rocks at water level on the opposite shore.\nFrom a map, you estimate the distance to the opposite shore as d ~ 6.1 km. Use\nFig. 1-14 with h = 3.0 m to estimate the radius R of the Earth.\nAPPROACH We use simple geometry, including the theorem of Pythagoras,\nd\nh\nLake\nEarth\nR\nR\nc2 = a2 + b2,\nwhere c is the length of the hypotenuse of any right triangle, and a and b are\nthe lengths of the other two sides.\nSOLUTION For the right triangle of Fig. 1-14, the two sides are the radius of\nthe Earth R and the distance d = 6.1 km = 6100 m. The hypotenuse is approx-\nimately the length R + h, where h = 3.0m. By the Pythagorean theorem,\nR2 + d2 ~ (R + h)2\n~ R2 + 2hR + h2.\nCenter\nof Earth\nFIGURE 1-14 Example 1-9, but\nnot to scale.

The dimensions of area, for\nexample, are always length squared, abbreviated [L2], using square brackets;\nthe units can be square meters, square feet, cm2, and so on. Velocity, on the\nother hand, can be measured in units of km/h, m/s, or mi/h, but the dimen-\nsions are always a length [L] divided by a time [T]: that is, [L/T].\nThe formula for a quantity may be different in different cases, but the dimen-\nsions remain the same. For example, the area of a triangle of base b and height h\nis A = 2bh, whereas the area of a circle of radius r is A = Tr2. The formulas\nare different in the two cases, but the dimensions of area are always [L2].\nDimensions can be used as a help in working out relationships, a procedure\nreferred to as dimensional analysis. One useful technique is the use of dimen-\nsions to check if a relationship is incorrect. Note that we add or subtract\nquantities only if they have the same dimensions (we don't add centimeters\nand hours); and the quantities on each side of an equals sign must have the\nsame dimensions. (In numerical calculations, the units must also be the same on\nboth sides of an equation.)\nFor example, suppose you derived the equation v = vo + 2at2, where v is\nthe speed of an object after a time t, vo is the object's initial speed, and the\nobject undergoes an acceleration a. Let's do a dimensional check to see if this\nequation could be correct or is surely incorrect. Note that numerical factors,\nlike the 2 here, do not affect dimensional checks. We write a dimensional\nequation as follows, remembering that the dimensions of speed are [L/T] and\n(as we shall see in Chapter 2) the dimensions of acceleration are [L/T2]:\nB\nL\nT\n?\nL\nT\nL\n+\nT2\nL\n4][P]\n?\nB\nT\n+ [L].\nThe dimensions are incorrect: on the right side, we have the sum of quantities\nwhose dimensions are not the same. Thus we conclude that an error was made\nin the derivation of the original equation.\nA dimensional check can only tell you when a relationship is wrong. It can't\ntell you if it is completely right. For example, a dimensionless numerical factor\n(such as 2 or 2Tr) could be missing.\nDimensional analysis can also be used as a quick check on an equation you\nare not sure about. For example, consider a simple pendulum of length l. Suppose\nthat you can't remember whether the equation for the period T (the time to make\none back-and-forth swing) is T = 2TVl/g or T = 2TVg/l, where g is the\nacceleration due to gravity and, like all accelerations, has dimensions [L/T2].\n(Do not worry about these formulas-the correct one will be derived in\nChapter 11; what we are concerned about here is a person's recalling whether it\ncontains {/g or g/l.)

The Summary\ncannot serve to give an understanding of the material, which can be\naccomplished only by a detailed reading of the Chapter.]\nPhysics, like other sciences, is a creative endeavor. It is\nnot simply a collection of facts. Important theories are\ncreated with the idea of explaining observations. To be\naccepted, theories are "tested" by comparing their predictions\nwith the results of actual experiments. Note that, in general,\na theory cannot be "proved" in an absolute sense.\nScientists often devise models of physical phenomena.\nA model is a kind of picture or analogy that helps to describe\nthe phenomena in terms of something we already know.\nA theory, often developed from a model, is usually deeper\nand more complex than a simple model.\nA scientific law is a concise statement, often expressed in\nthe form of an equation, which quantitatively describes a\nwide range of phenomena.\nMeasurements play a crucial role in physics, but can\nnever be perfectly precise. It is important to specify the\nQuestions\n1. What are the merits and drawbacks of using a person\'s\nfoot as a standard? Consider both (a) a particular\nperson\'s foot, and (b) any person\'s foot. Keep in mind\nthat it is advantageous that fundamental standards be\naccessible (easy to compare to), invariable (do not\nchange), indestructible, and reproducible.\n2. What is wrong with this road sign:\nMemphis 7 mi (11.263 km)?\n3. Why is it incorrect to think that the more digits you\ninclude in your answer, the more accurate it is?\nMisConceptual Questions\n[List all answers that are valid.]\n1. A student weighs herself on a digital bathroom scale as\n117.4 lb. If all the digits displayed reflect the true preci-\nsion of the scale, then probably her weight is\n(a) within 1% of 117.4 lb.\n(b) exactly 117.4 lb.\n(c) somewhere between 117.38 and 117.42 lb.\n(d) roughly between 117.2 and 117.6 lb.\n2. Four students use different instruments to measure the\nlength of the same pen. Which measurement implies the\ngreatest precision?\n(a) 160.0mm. (b) 16.0cm. (c) 0.160m. (d) 0.00016 km.\n(e) Need more information.\n3. The number 0.0078 has how many significant figures?\n(a) 1.\n(b) 2.\n(c) 3.\n(d) 4.\n4. How many significant figures does 1.362 + 25.2 have?\n(a) 2.\n(b) 3.\n(c) 4.\n(d) 5.\n5. Accuracy represents\n(a) repeatability of a measurement, using a given instrument.\n(b) how close a measurement is to the true value.\n(c) an ideal number of measurements to make.\n(d) how poorly an instrument is operating.\nuncertainty of a measurement either by stating it directly\nusing the + notation, and/or by keeping only the correct\nnumber of significant figures.\nPhysical quantities are always specified relative to a\nparticular standard or unit, and the unit used should always\nbe stated. The commonly accepted set of units today is the\nSystème International (SI), in which the standard units of\nlength, mass, and time are the meter, kilogram, and second.\nWhen converting units, check all conversion factors for\ncorrect cancellation of units.\nMaking rough, order-of-magnitude estimates is a very\nuseful technique in science as well as in everyday life.\n[*The dimensions of a quantity refer to the combination\nof base quantities that comprise it. Velocity, for example, has\ndimensions of [length/time] or [L/T]. Working with only the\ndimensions of the various quantities in a given relationship\n(this technique is called dimensional analysis) makes it\npossible to check a relationship for correct form.]\n4. For an answer to be complete, the units need to be speci-\nfied. Why?\n5. You measure the radius of a wheel to be 4.16 cm. If you\nmultiply by 2 to get the diameter, should you write the\nresult as 8 cm or as 8.32 cm? Justify your answer.\n6. Express the sine of 30.0° with the correct number of\nsignificant figures.\n7. List assumptions useful to estimate the number of car\nmechanics in (a) San Francisco, (b) your hometown, and\nthen make the estimates.\n6. To convert from ft2 to yd2, you should\n(a) multiply by 3.\n(b) multiply by 1/3.\n(c) multiply by 9.\n(d) multiply by 1/9.\n(e) multiply by 6.\n(f) multiply by 1/6.\n7. Which is not true about an order-of-magnitude estimation?\n(a) It gives you a rough idea of the answer.\n(b) It can be done by keeping only one significant figure.\n(c) It can be used to check if an exact calculation is\nreasonable.\n(d) It may require making some reasonable assumptions\nin order to calculate the answer.\n(e) It will always be accurate to at least two significant figures.\n*8.
