The\nreduced amount of air inside means its density is lower than the outside air, so\nthere is a net buoyant force upward on the balloon (Chapter 10). In this Chapter\nwe study temperature and its effects on matter: thermal expansion and the\ngas laws. We examine the microscopic theory of matter as atoms or molecules\nthat are continuously in motion, which we call kinetic theory.

("Kinetic," you\nmay recall from Chapter 6, is Greek for "moving.")\nWe also discuss the concept of temperature and how it is measured, as well as\nthe measured properties of gases which serve as a foundation for kinetic theory.\n13-1 Atomic Theory of Matter\nThe idea that matter is made up of atoms dates back to the ancient Greeks.\nAccording to the Greek philosopher Democritus, if a pure substance-say, a piece\nof iron-were cut into smaller and smaller bits, eventually a smallest piece of that\nsubstance would be obtained which could not be divided further. This smallest\npiece was called an atom, which in Greek means "indivisible." Today an atom is\nstill the smallest piece of a substance, but we do not consider it indivisible.

The experimental evidence\nin its favor, however, came mainly in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth\ncenturies, and much of it was obtained from the analysis of chemical reactions.\nWe will often speak of the relative masses of individual atoms and molecules-\nwhat we call the atomic mass or molecular mass, respectively. (The terms atomic\nweight and molecular weight are sometimes used.) These masses are based on\narbitrarily assigning the most abundant form of carbon atom, 12C, the atomic\nmass of exactly 12.0000 unified atomic mass units (u). In terms of kilograms,\n1 u = 1.6605 × 10-27 kg.\nThe average atomic mass of hydrogen is 1.0079 u, and the values for other\natoms are as listed in the Periodic Table inside the back cover of this book, and\nalso in Appendix B .* The molecular mass of a compound is the sum of atomic\nmasses of the atoms making up the molecules of that compound.\n[An element is a substance, such as neon, gold, iron, or copper, that cannot\nbe broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Compounds are\nsubstances made up of elements, and can be broken down into them; examples\nare carbon dioxide and water. The smallest piece of an element is an atom; the\nsmallest piece of a compound is a molecule. Molecules are made up of atoms;\na molecule of water, for example, is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one\nof oxygen; its chemical formula is H2O.]\nAn important piece of evidence for the atomic theory is called Brownian\nmotion, named after the biologist Robert Brown, who is credited with its discov-\nery in 1827. While he was observing tiny pollen grains suspended in water under\nhis microscope, Brown noticed that the tiny grains moved about in erratic paths\n(Fig. 13-1), even though the water appeared to be perfectly still. The atomic\ntheory easily explains Brownian motion if we assume that the atoms of any\nsubstance are continually in motion. Then Brown\'s tiny pollen grains are jostled\nabout by the vigorous barrage of rapidly moving molecules of water.\nIn 1905, Albert Einstein examined Brownian motion from a theoretical point\nof view and was able to calculate from the experimental data the approximate\nsize and mass of atoms and molecules. His calculations showed that the diameter\nof a typical atom is about 10-10 m.\nAt the start of Chapter 10, we distinguished the three common phases (or\nstates) of matter-solid, liquid, gas-based on macroscopic, or "large-scale," prop-\nerties. Now let us see how these three phases of matter differ, from the atomic\nor microscopic point of view. First of all, atoms and molecules must exert attractive\nforces on each other, because only this explains why a brick or a block of aluminum\nholds together in one piece. The attractive forces between molecules are of an electrical\nnature (more on this in later Chapters). When molecules come too close together,\nthe force between them must become repulsive (electric repulsion between their\nouter electrons). We need this assumption to explain that matter takes up space.\nThus molecules maintain a minimum distance from each other. In a solid material,\nthe attractive forces are strong enough that the atoms or molecules move only\nslightly (oscillate) about relatively fixed positions, often in an array known as a\ncrystal lattice, as shown in Fig. 13-2a. In a liquid, the atoms or molecules are moving\nmore rapidly, or the forces between them are weaker, so that they are sufficiently\nfree to pass around one another, as in Fig. 13-2b. In a gas, the forces are so weak, or\n+ The relative masses of different atoms came from analysis of chemical reactions, and the law of definite\nproportions. It states that when two or more elements combine to form a compound, they always do\nso in the same proportions by mass. For example, table salt is always formed from 23 parts sodium and\n35 parts chlorine; and water from one part hydrogen and eight parts oxygen. A continuous theory of\nmatter could not account for the law of definite proportions but atomic theory does: the proportions\nof each element that form a compound correspond to the relative masses of the combining atoms. One\natom of sodium (Na) combines with one atom of chlorine (Cl) to form one molecule of salt (NaCl),\nand one atom of sodium has a mass 23/35 times as large as one of chlorine. Hydrogen, the lightest\natom, was arbitrarily assigned the relative mass of 1. On this scale, carbon was about 12, oxygen 16,\nsodium 23, and so on. It was sometimes more complicated. For example, from the various compounds\noxygen formed, its relative mass was judged to be 16; but this was inconsistent with the mass ratio in\nwater of oxygen to hydrogen, only 8 to 1. This was explained by assuming two H atoms combine with\none O atom to form a water molecule.\n', 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'the speeds so high, that the molecules do not even stay close together. They move\nrapidly every which way, Fig. 13-2c, filling any container and occasionally colliding\nwith one another. On average, the speeds are sufficiently high in a gas that when\ntwo molecules collide, the force of attraction is not strong enough to keep them\nclose together and they fly off in new directions.\nEXAMPLE 13-1\nESTIMATE\nDistance between atoms. The density of\ncopper is 8.9 × 103 kg/m3, and each copper atom has a mass of 63 u. Estimate\nthe average distance between the centers of neighboring copper atoms.\nAPPROACH We consider a cube of copper 1 m on a side. From the given density p\nwe can calculate the mass m of a cube of volume V = 1 m3 (m = pV). We divide\nthis mass m by the mass of one atom (63 u) to obtain the number of atoms in 1 m3.\nWe assume the atoms are in a uniform array, and we let N be the number of atoms\nin a 1-m length; then (N)(N)(N) = N3 equals the total number of atoms in 1 m3.\nSOLUTION The mass of 1 copper atom is 63 u = 63 × 1.66 × 10-27 kg =\n1.05 × 10-25 kg. This means that in a cube of copper 1m on a side\n(volume = 1 m3), there are\n1.05 × 10-25 kg/atom\n8.9 × 103 kg\n= 8.5 × 1028 atoms.\nThe volume of a cube of side & is V = {3, so on one edge of the 1-m-long cube\nthere are (8.5 × 1028); atoms = 4.4 × 109 atoms. Hence the distance between\nneighboring atoms is\n4.4 × 109 atoms\n1 m\n= 2.3 ×10-10m.\nNOTE Watch out for units. Even though "atoms" is not a unit, it is helpful to\ninclude it to make sure you calculate correctly.\nNOTE The distance between atoms is essentially what we mean when we speak of\nthe size or diameter of an atom. So we have calculated the size of a copper atom.\n13-2 Temperature and Thermometers\nIn everyday life, temperature is a measure of how hot or cold something is. A hot\noven is said to have a high temperature, whereas the ice of a frozen lake is said to\nhave a low temperature.\nMany properties of matter change with temperature. For example, most mate-\nrials expand when their temperature is increased.+ An iron beam is longer when\nhot than when cold. Concrete roads and sidewalks expand and contract slightly\naccording to temperature, which is why compressible spacers or expansion joints\n(Fig. 13-3) are placed at regular intervals. The electrical resistance of matter\nchanges with temperature (Chapter 18). So too does the color radiated by objects,\nat least at high temperatures: you may have noticed that the heating element of an\nelectric stove glows with a red color when hot. At higher temperatures, solids such\nas iron glow orange or even white. The white light from an incandescent\nlightbulb comes from an extremely hot tungsten wire. The surface temperatures\nof the Sun and other stars can be measured by the predominant color (more\nprecisely, wavelengths) of light they emit.\nInstruments designed to measure temperature are called thermometers.\nThere are many kinds of thermometers, but their operation always depends on\nsome property of matter that changes with temperature. Many common thermom-\neters rely on the expansion of a material with an increase in temperature. The first\nidea for a thermometer, by Galileo, made use of the expansion of a gas. Common\nthermometers today consist of a hollow glass tube filled with mercury or with alco-\nhol colored with a red dye, as were the earliest usable thermometers (Fig. 13-4).\n* Most materials expand when their temperature is raised, but not all. Water, for example, in the\nrange 0°℃ to 4℃ contracts with an increase in temperature (see Section 13-4).\nFIGURE 13-3 Expansion joint on\na bridge. Note center white line of\nhighway.\nFIGURE 13-4 Thermometers built\nby the Accademia del Cimento\n(1657-1667) in Florence, Italy, are\namong the earliest known. These\nsensitive and exquisite instruments\ncontained alcohol, sometimes colored,\nlike many thermometers today.\nSECTION 13-2 Temperature and Thermometers 361\n', 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Tube\nBulb (acts as\na reservoir)\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 13-5 (a) Mercury- or\nalcohol-in-glass thermometer;\n(b) bimetallic strip.\nFIGURE 13-6 Photograph of a\nthermometer using a coiled\nbimetallic strip.\nInside a common liquid-in-glass thermometer, the liquid expands more than\nthe glass when the temperature is increased, so the liquid level rises in the tube\n(Fig. 13-5a). Although metals also expand with temperature, the change in length\nof a metal rod, say, is generally too small to measure accurately for ordinary changes\nin temperature. However, a useful thermometer can be made by bonding together\ntwo different metals with different rates of expansion (Fig. 13-5b). When the\ntemperature is increased, the different amounts of expansion cause the bimetallic\nstrip to bend. Often the bimetallic strip is in the form of a coil, one end of which\nis fixed while the other is attached to a pointer, Fig. 13-6. Such thermometers are\nused as ordinary air thermometers, oven thermometers, automatic off switches\nin electric coffeepots, and in room thermostats for determining when the heater\nor air conditioner should go on or off.

The most common scale today is the Celsius or centigrade scale. In the\nUnited States, the Fahrenheit scale is common. The most important scale in scientific\nwork is the absolute, or Kelvin, scale, and it will be discussed later in this Chapter.\nOne way to define a temperature scale is to assign arbitrary values to two\nreadily reproducible temperatures. For both the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales\nthese two fixed points are chosen to be the freezing point and the boiling point+\nof water, both taken at standard atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, the\nfreezing point of water is chosen to be 0℃ ("zero degrees Celsius") and the boiling\npoint 100°C. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point is defined as 32ºF and\nthe boiling point 212ºF. A practical thermometer is calibrated by placing it in\ncarefully prepared environments at each of the two temperatures and marking\nthe position of the liquid or pointer. For a Celsius scale, the distance between the\ntwo marks is divided into one hundred equal intervals representing each degree\nbetween 0°℃ and 100℃ (hence the name "centigrade scale" meaning "hundred\nsteps"). For the Fahrenheit scale, the two points are labeled 32ºF and 212ºF and\nthe distance between them is divided into 180 equal intervals. For temperatures\nbelow the freezing point of water and above the boiling point of water, the scales\nmay be extended using the same equally spaced intervals. However, thermome-\nters can be used only over a limited temperature range because of their own\nlimitations-for example, an alcohol-in-glass thermometer is rendered useless above\ntemperatures where the alcohol vaporizes. For very low or very high temperatures,\nspecialized thermometers are required, some of which we will mention later.\nEvery temperature on the Celsius scale corresponds to a particular temperature\non the Fahrenheit scale, Fig. 13-7. To convert from one to the other, remember\nthat 0°℃ corresponds to 32ºF and that a range of 100° on the Celsius scale corre-\nsponds to a range of 180° on the Fahrenheit scale. Thus, one Fahrenheit degree (1 Fº)\ncorresponds to 100/180 = of a Celsius degree (1 C°). That is, 1 Fº = {Cº.\n(Notice that when we refer to a specific temperature, we say "degrees Celsius,"\nas in 20°C; but when we refer to a change in temperature or a temperature\ninterval, we say "Celsius degrees," as in "2 C°.") The conversion between the two\ntemperature scales can be written\nor\nT(C) = ; [T( F) - 32]\nT(ºF) = {T(℃) + 32.\nRather than memorizing these relations, it may be simpler to remember that\n0°C = 32ºF and that a change of 5 C° = a change of 9 Fº.\n+ The freezing point of a substance is defined as that temperature at which the solid and liquid phases\ncoexist in equilibrium-that is, without any net liquid changing into the solid or vice versa. Experi-\nmentally, this is found to occur at only one definite temperature, for a given pressure. Similarly, the\nboiling point is defined as that temperature at which the liquid and gas coexist in equilibrium. Since\nthese points vary with pressure, the pressure must be specified (usually it is 1 atm).\n362 CHAPTER 13\n', 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 13-2\nTaking your temperature. Normal body temperature is\n98.6°F. What is this on the Celsius scale?\nAPPROACH We recall that 0°C = 32ºF and that a change of 5 C° = 9 Fº.\nSOLUTION First we relate the given temperature to the freezing point of water\n(0°℃). That is, 98.6°F is 98.6 - 32.0 = 66.6 Fº above the freezing point of water.\nSince each Fº is equal to ¿ C°, this corresponds to 66.6 × 5 = 37.0 Celsius\ndegrees above the freezing point. The freezing point of water is 0°℃, so normal\nbody temperature is 37.0°C.\nCAUTION\nConvert temperature by\nremembering 0°C = 32ºF and a\nchange of 5 C° = 9 Fº\n* Standard Temperature Scale\nDifferent materials do not expand in quite the same way over a wide temperature\nrange. Consequently, if we calibrate different kinds of thermometers exactly as\ndescribed above, they will not usually agree precisely.\nBecause of such discrepancies, some standard kind of thermometer must be\nchosen so that all temperatures can be precisely defined. The chosen standard for\nthis purpose is the constant-volume gas thermometer. As shown in the simplified\ndiagram of Fig. 13-8, this thermometer consists of a bulb filled with a low-\npressure gas connected by a thin tube to a mercury manometer (Section 10-6).\nThe volume of the gas is kept constant by raising or lowering the right-hand tube\nof the manometer so that the mercury in the left-hand tube coincides with the\nreference mark. An increase in temperature causes a proportional increase in\npressure in the bulb. Thus the tube must be lifted higher to keep the gas volume\nconstant. The height of the mercury in the right-hand column is then a measure\nof the temperature. This thermometer gives the same results for all gases in the\nlimit of reducing the gas pressure in the bulb toward zero. The resulting scale\nserves as a basis for the standard temperature scale.\nGas\n+-Reference\nmark\nMercury\nBulb\nConnecting\nhose\nFIGURE 13-8 Constant-volume gas\nthermometer.\n13-3 Thermal Equilibrium and the\nZeroth Law of Thermodynamics\nIf two objects at different temperatures are placed in thermal contact (meaning\nthermal energy can transfer from one to the other), the two objects will eventually\nreach the same temperature. They are then said to be in thermal equilibrium. For\nexample, you leave a fever thermometer in your mouth until it comes into thermal\nequilibrium with that environment; then you read it. Two objects are defined\nto be in thermal equilibrium if, when placed in thermal contact, no net energy\nflows from one to the other, and their temperatures don't change.\n*The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics\nExperiments indicate that\nif two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in\nthermal equilibrium with each other.\nThis postulate is called the zeroth law of thermodynamics. It has this unusual\nname because it was not until after the first and second laws of thermodynamics\n(Chapter 15) were worked out that scientists realized that this apparently obvious\npostulate needed to be stated first.\nTemperature is a property of a system that determines whether the system\nwill be in thermal equilibrium with other systems. When two systems are in ther-\nmal equilibrium, their temperatures are (by definition) equal, and no net thermal\nenergy is exchanged between them. This is consistent with our everyday notion\nof temperature: when a hot object and a cold one are put into contact, they even-\ntually come to the same temperature. Thus the importance of the zeroth law is\nthat it allows a useful definition of temperature.\n← →\nSECTION 13-3 Thermal Equilibrium and the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics 363\n", 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': '1-\n10\nat T0\nat T\nl\n-\nFIGURE 13-9 A thin rod of length lo\nat temperature T0 is heated to a new\nuniform temperature T and acquires\nlength l, where l = lo + Al.\n13-4 Thermal Expansion\nMost substances expand when heated and contract when cooled. However, the\namount of expansion or contraction varies, depending on the material.\nLinear Expansion\nExperiments indicate that the change in length Al of almost all solids is, to a good\napproximation, directly proportional to the change in temperature AT, as long as\nAT is not too large. The change in length is also proportional to the original\nlength of the object, l0 . That is, for the same temperature increase, a 4-m-long\niron rod will increase in length twice as much as a 2-m-long iron rod. We can\nwrite this proportionality as an equation:\nAl = alo AT,\n(13-1a)\nwhere a, the proportionality constant, is called the coefficient of linear expansion\nfor the particular material and has units of (Co)-1. We write & = lo + Al,\nFig. 13-9, and rewrite this equation as\nl = lo (1 + a AT),\n(13-1b)\nwhere l 0 is the length initially, at temperature T 0 , and l is the length after heating\nor cooling to a temperature T. If the temperature change AT = T - To is nega-\ntive, then Al = l - lo is also negative; the length shortens as the temperature\ndecreases.\nThe values of a for various materials at 20°℃ are listed in Table 13-1. Actu-\nally, a does vary slightly with temperature (which is why thermometers made of\ndifferent materials do not agree precisely).

Note also that linear expansion\nhas no meaning for liquids and gases because they do not have fixed shapes.\nEquations 13-1 and 13-2 are accurate only if Al (or AV) is small compared\nto l0 (or V0 ). This is of particular concern for liquids and even more so for gases\nbecause of the large values of B. Furthermore, ß itself varies substantially with\ntemperature for gases. Therefore, a more convenient way of dealing with gases is\nneeded, and will be discussed starting in Section 13-5.\nEXAMPLE 13-7\nGas tank in the Sun. The 70-liter (L) steel gas tank of a\ncar is filled to the top with gasoline at 20°C. The car sits in the Sun and the tank\nreaches a temperature of 40°C (104ºF). How much gasoline do you expect to\noverflow from the tank?\nAPPROACH Both the gasoline and the tank expand as the temperature increases,\nand we assume they do so linearly as described by Eq. 13-2. The volume of\noverflowing gasoline equals the volume increase of the gasoline minus the\nincrease in volume of the tank.\nSOLUTION The gasoline expands by\nAV= BVoAT = (950 × 10-6/Cº)(70L)(40℃ - 20℃)\n= 1.3 L.\nThe tank also expands. We can think of it as a steel shell that undergoes volume\nexpansion (B = 35 × 10-6/C° ~ 3a). If the tank were solid, the surface layer\n(the shell) would expand just the same (as in Example 13-4). Thus the tank\nincreases in volume by\nAV = (35 × 10-6/C°)(70L)(40℃ - 20℃) = 0.049 L,\nso the tank expansion has little effect. More than a liter of gas could spill out.\nAnomalous Behavior of Water Below 4℃\nMost substances expand more or less uniformly with an increase in temperature,\nas long as no phase change occurs. Water, however, does not follow the usual pat-\ntern. If water at 0℃ is heated, it actually decreases in volume until it reaches 4°C.\nAbove 4℃ water behaves normally and expands in volume as the temperature is\nincreased, Fig. 13-13. Water thus has its greatest density at 4℃. This anomalous\nbehavior of water is of great importance for the survival of aquatic life during\ncold winters. When water in a lake (or river) is above 4℃ and begins to cool by contact\nwith cold air, the water at the surface sinks because it is denser. It is replaced by\nwarmer water from below. This mixing continues until the temperature of the entire\nlake reaches 4ºC. As the surface water cools further, it remains on the surface\nbecause it is less dense than the 4℃ water below. Water thus freezes first at the\nsurface, and the ice remains on the surface since ice (specific gravity = 0.917) is\nless dense than water. The water at the bottom remains liquid unless it is so cold\nthat the whole body of water freezes. If water were like most substances, becoming\nmore dense as it cools, the water at the bottom of a lake would be frozen first.\n366 CHAPTER 13 Temperature and Kinetic Theory\n', 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Lakes would freeze solid more easily because circulation would bring the warmer\nwater to the surface to be efficiently cooled. The complete freezing of a lake would\ncause severe damage to its plant and animal life. Because of the unusual behavior\nof water below 4°C, it is rare for any large and deep body of water to freeze\ncompletely, and this is helped by the layer of ice on the surface which acts as an\ninsulator to reduce the flow of heat out of the water into the cold air above. Without\nthis peculiar but wonderful property of water, life on this planet as we know it\nmight not have been possible.\nNot only does water expand as it cools from 4℃ to 0℃, it expands even more\nas it freezes to ice. This is why ice cubes float in water and pipes break when water\ninside them freezes.\n* Thermal Stresses\nIn many situations, such as in buildings and roads, the ends of a beam or slab of\nmaterial are rigidly fixed, which greatly limits expansion or contraction. If the\ntemperature should change, large compressive or tensile stresses, called thermal\nstresses, will occur. The magnitude of such stresses can be calculated using the\nconcept of elastic modulus developed in Chapter 9. To calculate the internal\nstress in a beam, we can think of this process as occurring in two steps: (1) the\nbeam tries to expand (or contract) by an amount Al given by Eq. 13-1; (2) the\nsolid in contact with the beam exerts a force to compress (or expand) it, keeping\nit at its original length. The force F required is given by Eq. 9-4:\n1 F\nAl = " + lo ,\nE A\nwhere E is Young\'s modulus for the material. To calculate the internal stress,\nF / A, we then set Al in Eq. 13-1a equal to Al in the equation above and find\nal AT =\n1 F\nE A\n- lo.\nHence, the stress is\nF\nÀ = QE AT.\nFor example, if 10-m-long concrete slabs are placed touching each other in a new\npark you are designing, a 30℃ increase in temperature would produce a stress\nF/A= QE AT = (12× 10-6/C°)(20×109 N/m2)(30 Cº) =7.2×106 N/m2. That\nstress would exceed the shear strength of concrete (Table 9-2), no doubt causing\nfracture and cracks. This is why soft spacers (or expansion joints) are placed between\nslabs on sidewalks and highways.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nLife under ice\n13-5 The Gas Laws and\nAbsolute Temperature\nEquation 13-2 is not useful for describing the expansion of a gas, partly because\nthe expansion can be so great, and partly because gases generally expand to fill\nwhatever container they are in. Indeed, Eq. 13-2 is meaningful only if the pres-\nsure is kept constant. The volume of a gas depends very much on the pressure as\nwell as on the temperature. It is therefore valuable to determine a relation\nbetween the volume, the pressure, the temperature, and the quantity of a gas. Such\na relation is called an equation of state. (By the word state, we mean the physical\ncondition of the system.)\nIf the state of a system is changed, we will always wait until the pressure and\ntemperature have reached the same values throughout. We thus consider only\nequilibrium states of a system-when the variables that describe it (such as tem-\nperature and pressure) are the same throughout the system and are not changing in\ntime. We also note that the results of this Section are accurate only for gases that\nare not too dense (the pressure is not too high, on the order of an atmosphere\nor less) and not close to the liquefaction (boiling) point.\nSECTION 13-5 The Gas Laws and Absolute Temperature 367\n', 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'P\nV\n0\nFIGURE 13-14 Pressure vs. volume\nof a fixed amount of gas at a\nconstant temperature, showing the\ninverse relationship as given by\nBoyle\'s law: as the pressure\ndecreases, the volume increases.\nFIGURE 13-15 Volume of a fixed\namount of gas as a function of\n(a) Celsius temperature, and\n(b) Kelvin temperature, when the\npressure is kept constant.\n-273°℃\n0°℃ 100°℃ 200°℃\nVolume\nVolume\nTemperature (℃)\n(a)\n0K 100 K 200 K 300 K 400 K 500 K\nTemperature (kelvins, or K)\n(b)\nFor a given quantity of gas it is found experimentally that, to a good approxi-\nmation, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the absolute pressure\napplied to it when the temperature is kept constant. That is,\nA\n8\n1\n,\nP\n[constant T]\nwhere P is the absolute pressure (not "gauge pressure"-see Section 10-4). For\nexample, if the pressure on a gas is doubled, the volume is reduced to half its\noriginal volume. This relation is known as Boyle\'s law, after the Englishman\nRobert Boyle (1627-1691), who first stated it on the basis of his own experiments.\nA graph of P vs. V for a fixed temperature is shown in Fig. 13-14. Boyle\'s law can\nalso be written\nPV = constant\n[constant T]\nfor a fixed quantity of a gas kept at constant temperature. If either the pressure\nor volume of a fixed amount of gas is allowed to vary, the other variable also\nchanges so that the product PV remains constant.\nTemperature also affects the volume of a gas, but a quantitative relationship\nbetween V and T was not found until more than a century after Boyle\'s work.\nThe Frenchman Jacques Charles (1746-1823) found that when the pressure is not\ntoo high and is kept constant, the volume of a gas increases with temperature at\na nearly linear rate, as shown in Fig. 13-15a. However, all gases liquefy at low\ntemperatures (for example, oxygen liquefies at -183℃), so the graph cannot be\nextended below the liquefaction point. Nonetheless, the graph is essentially a\nstraight line and if projected to lower temperatures, as shown by the dashed line,\nit crosses the axis at about -273ºC.\nSuch a graph can be drawn for any gas, and a straight line results which\nalways projects back to -273℃ at zero volume. This seems to imply that if a gas\ncould be cooled to -273ºC, it would have zero volume, and at lower tempera-\ntures a negative volume, which makes no sense. It could be argued that -273℃\nis the lowest temperature possible; indeed, many other more recent experiments\nindicate that this is so. This temperature is called the absolute zero of tempera-\nture. Its value has been determined to be -273.15℃.\nAbsolute zero forms the basis of a temperature scale known as the absolute\nscale or Kelvin scale, and it is used extensively in scientific work. On this scale\nthe temperature is specified as degrees Kelvin or, preferably, simply as kelvins (K)\nwithout the degree sign. The intervals are the same as for the Celsius scale, but\nthe zero on this scale (0 K) is chosen as absolute zero. Thus the freezing point of\nwater (0℃) is 273.15 K, and the boiling point of water is 373.15 K. Indeed, any\ntemperature on the Celsius scale can be changed to kelvins by adding 273.15 to it:\nT(K) = T(C) + 273.15.\nNow let us look at Fig. 13-15b, where the graph of the volume of a gas versus\nabsolute temperature is a straight line that passes through the origin. Thus, to a\ngood approximation, the volume of a fixed quantity of gas is directly proportional\nto the absolute temperature when the pressure is kept constant. This is known as\nCharles\'s law, and is written\nV x T.\n[constant P]\nA third gas law, known as Gay-Lussac\'s law, after Joseph Gay-Lussac\n(1778-1850), states that at constant volume, the absolute pressure of a fixed quantity\nof a gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature:\nP & T.\n[constant V]\nThe laws of Boyle, Charles, and Gay-Lussac are not really laws in the sense\nthat we use this term today (precise, deep, wide-ranging validity). They are really\nonly approximations that are accurate for real gases only as long as the pressure\nand density of the gas are not too high, and the gas is not too close to liquefaction\n(condensation). The term law applied to these three relationships has become\ntraditional, however, so we have stuck with that usage.\n368 CHAPTER 13 Temperature and Kinetic Theory\n', 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 13-8\nWhy you should not put a closed glass\njar into a campfire. What could happen if you tossed an empty glass jar, with\nthe lid on tight, into a fire, and why?\nRESPONSE The inside of the jar is not empty. It is filled with air. As the fire\nheats the air inside, its temperature rises. The volume of the glass jar changes\nonly slightly due to the heating. According to Gay-Lussac\'s law the pressure P of\nthe air inside the jar can increase enough to cause the jar to explode, throwing\nglass pieces outward.\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nThrowing a jar into a campfire\n13-6 The Ideal Gas Law\nThe gas laws of Boyle, Charles, and Gay-Lussac were obtained by means of an\nimportant scientific technique: namely, considering one quantity and how it is\naffected by changing only one other variable, keeping all other variables constant.\nThese laws can now be combined into a single more general relation among all\nthree variables-absolute pressure, volume, and absolute temperature of a fixed\namount of gas:\nPV x T.\nThis relation indicates how any of the quantities P, V, or T will vary when the\nother two quantities change. This relation reduces to Boyle\'s, Charles\'s, or\nGay-Lussac\'s law when either T, P, or V, respectively, is held constant.\nFinally, we must incorporate the effect of the amount of gas present. For exam-\nple, when more air is forced into a balloon, the balloon gets bigger (Fig. 13-16).\nIndeed, careful experiments show that at constant temperature and pressure, the\nvolume V of an enclosed gas increases in direct proportion to the mass m of gas\npresent. Hence we write\nPV x mT.\nThis proportion can be made into an equation by inserting a constant of propor-\ntionality. Experiment shows that this constant has a different value for different\ngases. However, the constant of proportionality turns out to be the same for all\ngases if, instead of the mass m, we use the number of moles.\nThe "mole" is an official SI unit for the amount of substance. One mole\n(abbreviated mol) is the amount of substance that contains 6.02 × 1023 objects\n(usually atoms, molecules, or ions, etc.). This number is called Avogadro\'s number,\nas discussed in Section 13-8. Its value comes from measurements. The mole\'s\nprecise definition is the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12\n(page 360).\nEquivalently, 1 mol is that amount of substance whose mass in grams is\nnumerically equal to the molecular mass of the substance (Section 13-1). For\nexample, the mass of 1 mole of CO2 is [12 + (2 × 16)] = 44 g because carbon\nhas atomic mass of 12 and oxygen 16 (see Periodic Table inside the rear cover).\nIn general, the number of moles, n, in a given sample of a pure substance is\nequal to the mass of the sample in grams divided by the molecular mass specified\nas grams per mole:\nFIGURE 13-16 Blowing up a\nballoon means putting more air\n(more air molecules) into the\nballoon, which increases its volume.\nThe pressure is nearly constant, at\natmospheric pressure, except for the\nsmall effect of the balloon\'s elasticity.\nmass (grams)\n.\nn (mole) =\nmolecular mass (g/mol)\nFor example, the number of moles in 132 g of CO2 (molecular mass 44 u) is\nn =\n132 g\n44 g/mol\n= 3.0 mol.\nSECTION 13-6 The Ideal Gas Law 369\n', 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'IDEAL GAS LAW\nCAUTION\nAlways give T in kelvins and\nP as absolute (not gauge) pressure\nWe can now write the proportion above (PV x mT) as an equation:\nPV = nRT,\n(13-3)\nwhere n represents the number of moles and R is the constant of proportionality.\nR is called the universal gas constant because its value is found experimentally to\nbe the same for all gases.

It was first recognized, although in a slightly\ndifferent form, by the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (1776-1856). Avogadro\nstated that equal volumes of gas at the same pressure and temperature contain\nequal numbers of molecules. This is sometimes called Avogadro's hypothesis.\nThat this is consistent with R being the same for all gases can be seen as follows.\nFrom Eq. 13-3, PV = nRT, we see that for the same number of moles, n, and the\nsame pressure and temperature, the volume will be the same for all gases as long\nas R is the same. Second, the number of molecules in 1 mole is the same for all\ngases (see page 369). Thus Avogadro's hypothesis is equivalent to R being the same\nfor all gases.\nThe number of molecules in one mole of any pure substance is known as\nAvogadro's number, NA . Although Avogadro conceived the notion, he was not\nable to actually determine the value of NA . Indeed, precise measurements were\nnot done until the twentieth century.\nA number of methods have been devised to measure NA, and the accepted\nvalue today is (see inside front cover for more precise value)\nNA = 6.02 × 1023.\n[molecules/mole]\nSince the total number of molecules, N, in a gas is equal to NA times the number\nof moles (N = nNA), then the ideal gas law, Eq. 13-3, can be written in terms of\nthe number of molecules present:\nIDEAL GAS LAW\n(in terms of molecules)\nor\nPV = nRT =\nN RT,\nNA\nPV = NKT,\n(13-4)\nwhere k = R/NA is called the Boltzmann constant and has the value\nk =\nR\n=\n8.314 J/mol · K\nNA\n6.02 × 1023 / mol\n= 1.38 × 10-23 J/K.\n372 CHAPTER 13 Temperature and Kinetic Theory\n", 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 13-13\nHydrogen atom mass.

Most importantly, we will arrive at an important relation between\nthe average kinetic energy of molecules in a gas and the absolute temperature.\nWe make the following assumptions about the molecules in a gas. These\nassumptions reflect a simple view of a gas, but nonetheless the results they predict\ncorrespond well to the essential features of real gases that are at low pressure\nand are far from the liquefaction point. Under these conditions real gases follow the\nideal gas law quite closely, and indeed the gas we now describe is referred to as\nan ideal gas. The assumptions representing the basic postulates of kinetic theory\nfor an ideal gas are:\n1. There are a large number of molecules, N, each of mass m, moving in random\ndirections with a variety of speeds. This assumption agrees with our observation\nthat a gas fills its container and, in the case of air on Earth, is kept from\nescaping only by the force of gravity.\n2. The molecules are, on average, far apart from one another. That is, their average\nseparation is much greater than the diameter of each molecule.\n3. The molecules are assumed to obey the laws of classical mechanics, and are\nassumed to interact with one another only when they collide. Although molecules\nexert weak attractive forces on each other between collisions, the potential\nenergy associated with these forces is small compared to the kinetic energy.\n4. Collisions with another molecule or the wall of the vessel are assumed to be\nperfectly elastic, like the collisions of perfectly elastic billiard balls (Chapter 7).\nWe assume the collisions are of very short duration compared to the time\nbetween collisions. Then we can ignore the potential energy associated with\ncollisions in comparison to the kinetic energy between collisions.\nSECTION 13-9 373\n", 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'y\nl\n-\n-A\nZ.\n(a)\ny\nl\n-\n-x\nx\nZ.\n(b)\nFIGURE 13-18 (a) Molecules of a\ngas moving about in a rectangular\ncontainer. (b) Arrows indicate the\nmomentum of one molecule as it\nrebounds from the end wall.\nWe can see how this kinetic view of a gas can explain Boyle\'s law (Section 13-5).\nThe pressure exerted on a wall of a container of gas is due to the constant bom-\nbardment of molecules. If the volume is reduced by (say) half, the molecules are\ncloser together and twice as many will be striking a given area of the wall per second.\nHence we expect the pressure to be twice as great, in agreement with Boyle\'s law.\nNow let us calculate quantitatively the pressure a gas exerts on its container in\nterms of microscopic quantities. We imagine that the molecules are inside a rectangular\ncontainer (at rest) whose ends have area A and whose length is , as shown in\nFig. 13-18a. The pressure exerted by the gas on the walls of its container is,\naccording to our model, due to the collisions of the molecules with the walls. Let\nus focus our attention on the wall, of area A, at the left end of the container and\nexamine what happens when one molecule strikes this wall, as shown in Fig. 13-18b.\nThis molecule exerts a force on the wall, and according to Newton\'s third law\nthe wall exerts an equal and opposite force back on the molecule. The magnitude\nof this force on the molecule, according to Newton\'s second law, is equal to the\nmolecule\'s rate of change of momentum, F = A(mv)/At (Eq. 7-2). Assuming\nthe collision is elastic, only the x component of the molecule\'s momentum changes,\nand it changes from -mvx (it is moving in the negative x direction) to +mvx . Thus\nthe change in the molecule\'s momentum, A(mv), which is the final momentum\nminus the initial momentum, is\n4(mv) = mvx - (-mvx) = 2mvx\nfor one collision. This molecule will make many collisions with the wall, each\nseparated by a time At, which is the time it takes the molecule to travel across\nthe container and back again, a distance (x component) equal to 20. Thus 20 = vx At,\nor\nAt = 28\n.\n21\nUx\nThe time At between collisions with a wall is very small, so the number of colli-\nsions per second is very large. Thus the average force-averaged over many\ncollisions-will be equal to the momentum change during one collision divided\nby the time between collisions (Newton\'s second law, Eq. 7-2):\nF = "\n4(mv)\nAt\n21/0x\n2mvx = mx.\n[due to one molecule]\nDuring its passage back and forth across the container, the molecule may collide\nwith the tops and sides of the container, but this does not alter its x component of\nmomentum and thus does not alter our result. [It may also collide with other\nmolecules, which may change its vx . However, any loss (or gain) of momentum is\nacquired by other molecules, and because we will eventually sum over all the\nmolecules, this effect will be included. So our result above is not altered.]\nThe actual force due to one molecule is intermittent, but because a huge num-\nber of molecules are striking the wall per second, the force is, on average, nearly\nconstant. To calculate the force due to all the molecules in the container, we have\nto add the contributions of each. If all N molecules have the same mass m, the net\nforce on the wall is\nF = (v31+V2+.+vxN),\nwhere Vr1 means vx for molecule number 1 (we arbitrarily assign each molecule\na number) and the sum extends over the total number of molecules N in the\ncontainer. The average value of the square of the x component of velocity is\n03x1 + 32 + ... + V\'IN\nN\n(13-5)\n,\nwhere the overbar (-) means "average." Thus we can write the force as\nF = m NOK.\n(i)\nWe know that the square of any vector is equal to the sum of the squares of its\ncomponents (theorem of Pythagoras). Thus v2 = 02 + 02 + v2 for any velocity v.\n374 CHAPTER 13 Temperature and Kinetic Theory\n', 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Taking averages, we obtain\n正=+0+0.\n(ii)\nSince the velocities of the molecules in our gas are assumed to be random, there\nis no preference to one direction or another.

Modern quantum theory,\nhowever, tells us this is not quite so. Instead, as absolute zero is approached, the\nkinetic energy approaches a very small nonzero minimum value. Even though all\nreal gases become liquid or solid near 0 K, molecular motion does not cease,\neven at absolute zero.\n13-10 Distribution of Molecular Speeds\nThe molecules in a gas are assumed to be in random motion, which means that\nmany molecules have speeds less than the rms speed and others have greater\nspeeds. In 1859, James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) derived, on the basis of kinetic\ntheory, that the speeds of molecules in a gas are distributed according to the\ngraph shown in Fig. 13-19. This is known as the Maxwell distribution of speeds.+\nThe speeds vary from zero to many times the rms speed, but as the graph shows,\nmost molecules have speeds that are not far from the average. Less than 1% of\nthe molecules exceed four times Vrms .\nExperiments to determine the distribution of molecular speeds in real gases,\nstarting in the 1920s, confirmed with considerable accuracy the Maxwell distri-\nbution and the direct proportion between average kinetic energy and absolute\ntemperature, Eq. 13-8.\nSpeed, v\n* Mathematically, the distribution is given by AN = Cv2 exp(-}mv2/kT)Av, where AN is the num-\nber of molecules with speed between v and v + Av, C is a constant, and exp means the expression\nin parentheses is an exponent on the "natural number" e = 2.718 ....\n376 CHAPTER 13 Temperature and Kinetic Theory\n', 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Figure 13-20 shows the Maxwell distribution for two different temperatures.\nJust as Vrms increases with temperature, so the whole distribution curve shifts to\nthe right at higher temperatures. Kinetic theory can be applied approximately to\nliquids and solutions. Figure 13-20 illustrates how kinetic theory can explain why\nmany chemical reactions, including those in biological cells, take place more\nrapidly as the temperature increases. Most chemical reactions occur in a liquid\nsolution, and the molecules have a speed distribution close to the Maxwell distri-\nbution. Two molecules may chemically react only if their kinetic energy is above\nsome particular minimum value (called the activation energy), EA, so that when\nthey collide, they penetrate into each other somewhat.

But what happens when these two criteria are not satisfied?\nFirst we discuss real gas behavior, and then we examine how kinetic theory can\nhelp us understand this behavior.\nLet us look at a graph of pressure plotted against volume for a given amount\nof gas. On such a PV diagram, Fig. 13-21, each point represents the pressure and\nvolume of an equilibrium state of the given substance. The various curves\n(labeled A, B, C, and D) show how the pressure varies as a function of volume\nfor four different values of constant temperature TA, TB, Tc, and Tp . The red\ndashed curve A' represents the behavior of a gas as predicted by the ideal gas\nlaw; that is, PV = constant. The solid curve A represents the behavior of a real\ngas at the same temperature. Notice that at high pressure, the volume of a\nreal gas is less than that predicted by the ideal gas law. The curves B and C in\nFig. 13-21 represent the gas at successively lower temperatures, and we see that\nthe behavior deviates even more from the curves predicted by the ideal gas law\n(for example, B'), and the deviation is greater the closer the gas is to liquefying.\nTo explain this behavior, note that at higher pressure we expect the molecules\nto be closer together. And at lower temperatures, the potential energy associated\nwith attractive forces between the molecules (which we ignored before) is no\nlonger negligible. These attractive forces tend to pull the molecules closer together so\nthe volume is less than expected from the ideal gas law. At still lower temperatures,\nthese forces cause liquefaction, and the molecules become very close together.\nCurve D represents the situation when liquefaction occurs. At low pressure\non curve D (on the right in Fig. 13-21), the substance is a gas and occupies a large\nvolume. As the pressure is increased, the volume decreases until point b is reached.\nFrom point b to point a, the volume decreases with no change in pressure; the\nsubstance is gradually changing from the gas to the liquid phase. At point a, all of\nthe substance has changed to liquid. Further increase in pressure reduces the\nvolume only slightly-liquids are nearly incompressible-so on the left the curve\nis very steep as shown. The shaded area under the gold dashed line represents the\nregion where the gas and liquid phases exist together in equilibrium.\nCurve C in Fig. 13-21 represents the behavior of the substance at its critical\ntemperature; the point c (the one point where curve C is horizontal) is called the\ncritical point. At temperatures less than the critical temperature, a gas will change\nto the liquid phase if sufficient pressure is applied. Above the critical tempera-\nture (and this is the definition of the term), no amount of pressure can cause a gas\nto change phase and become a liquid. (Thus curves A and B represent the sub-\nstance at temperatures where it can only be a gas.) The critical temperatures for\nvarious gases are given in Table 13-2. Scientists tried for many years to liquefy\noxygen without success, which led to the idea that there must be a critical point.\nOxygen can be liquefied only if first cooled below its critical temperature of -118℃.\nSpeed\nv(EA)\nFIGURE 13-20 Distribution of\nmolecular speeds for two different\ntemperatures.

Sublimation refers to the process whereby at low pressures a\nsolid changes directly into the vapor phase without passing through the liquid\nphase.

For\nwater this occurs at T = 273.16 K and P = 6.03 × 10-3 atm. It is only at the\ntriple point that the three phases can exist together in equilibrium. Because the\ntriple point corresponds to a unique value of temperature and pressure, it is pre-\ncisely reproducible and is often used as a point of reference. For example, the\nstandard of temperature is usually specified as exactly 273.16 K at the triple point\nof water, rather than 273.15 K at the freezing point of water at 1 atm.\nCritical\npoint\n73\nSolid\nLiquid\n56\nP (atm)\nTriple\npoint\n5.11\ns-l\n1-2\nVapor\nS- U\n1\n-56.6\nT (°℃)\n20\n31\nNotice that the solid-liquid (s-() curve for water (Fig. 13-22) slopes upward to\nthe left.

For example, ice has been observed in at least eight\nforms at very high pressure. Ordinary helium has two distinct liquid phases, called\nhelium I and II. They exist only at temperatures within a few degrees of absolute\nzero. Helium II exhibits very unusual properties referred to as superfluidity.\nIt has essentially zero viscosity and exhibits strange properties such as climbing\nup the sides of an open container. Also interesting are liquid crystals (used for\ncomputer and TV monitors, Section 24-11) which can be considered to be in a\nphase between liquid and solid.\n378 CHAPTER 13 Temperature and Kinetic Theory\n', 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': "13-12 Vapor Pressure and Humidity\nEvaporation\nIf a glass of water is left out overnight, the water level will have dropped by morning.\nWe say the water has evaporated, meaning that some of the water has changed to\nthe vapor or gas phase.\nThis process of evaporation can be explained on the basis of kinetic theory.\nThe molecules in a liquid move past one another with a variety of speeds that\nfollow, approximately, the Maxwell distribution. There are strong attractive\nforces between these molecules, which is what keeps them close together in the\nliquid phase. A molecule near the surface of the liquid may, because of its speed,\nleave the liquid momentarily. But just as a rock thrown into the air returns to the\nEarth, so the attractive forces of the other molecules can pull the vagabond mole-\ncule back to the liquid surface-that is, if its velocity is not too large. A molecule\nwith a high enough velocity, however, will escape the liquid entirely, like a rocket\nescaping the Earth, and become part of the gas phase. Only those molecules that\nhave kinetic energy above a particular value can escape to the gas phase. We have\nalready seen that kinetic theory predicts that the relative number of molecules\nwith kinetic energy above a particular value (such as EA in Fig. 13-20) increases\nwith temperature. This is in accord with the well-known observation that the\nevaporation rate is greater at higher temperatures.\nBecause it is the fastest molecules that escape from the surface, the average\nspeed of those remaining is less. When the average speed is less, the absolute tem-\nperature is less. Thus kinetic theory predicts that evaporation is a cooling process.\nYou may have noticed this effect when you stepped out of a warm shower and\nfelt cold as the water on your body began to evaporate; and after working up a\nsweat on a hot day, even a slight breeze makes you feel cool through evaporation.\nTry licking your finger and then blow on it.\nVapor Pressure\nAir normally contains water vapor (water in the gas phase), and it comes mainly\nfrom evaporation. To look at this process in a little more detail, consider a closed\ncontainer that is partially filled with water (or another liquid) and from which the\nair has been removed (Fig. 13-24). The fastest moving molecules quickly evaporate\ninto the empty space above the liquid's surface. As they move about, some of these\nmolecules strike the liquid surface and again become part of the liquid phase: this\nis called condensation. The number of molecules in the vapor increases until\nthe number of molecules returning to the liquid equals the number leaving in the\nsame time interval. Equilibrium then exists, and the space above the liquid surface is\nsaid to be saturated. The pressure of the vapor when it is saturated is called the\nsaturated vapor pressure (or simply the vapor pressure).\nThe saturated vapor pressure of any substance depends on the temperature.\nAt higher temperatures, more molecules have sufficient kinetic energy to break\nfrom the liquid surface into the vapor phase. Hence equilibrium will be reached\nat a higher vapor pressure. The saturated vapor pressure of water at various tempera-\ntures is given in Table 13-3. Notice that even solids-for example, ice-have a\nmeasurable saturated vapor pressure.\nIn everyday situations, evaporation from a liquid takes place into the air\nabove it rather than into a vacuum. This does not materially alter the discussion\nabove relating to Fig. 13-24. Equilibrium will still be reached when there are\nsufficient molecules in the gas phase that the number reentering the liquid equals\nthe number leaving. The concentration of particular molecules (such as water) in\nthe gas phase is not affected by the presence of air, although collisions with air\nmolecules may lengthen the time needed to reach equilibrium. Thus equilibrium\noccurs at the same value of the saturated vapor pressure as if air were not there.\nIf the container is large or is not closed, all the liquid may evaporate before\nsaturation is reached. And if the container is not sealed-as, for example, a room\nin your house-it is not likely that the air will become saturated with water vapor\n(unless it is raining outside).\nFIGURE 13-24 Vapor appears\nabove a liquid in a closed container.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nEvaporation cools\nTABLE 13-3 Saturated\nVapor Pressure of Water\nTemp-\nerature\n(°℃)\nSaturated Vapor Pressure\ntorr\n(= mm-Hg)\nPa\n(= N/m2)\n-50\n0.030\n4.0\n-10\n1.95\n2.60 × 102\n0\n4.58\n6.11 × 102\n5\n6.54\n8.72 × 102\n10\n9.21\n1.23 × 103\n15\n12.8\n1.71 × 103\n20\n17.5\n2.33 × 103\n25\n23.8\n3.17 × 103\n30\n31.8\n4.24 × 103\n40\n55.3\n7.37 × 103\n50\n92.5\n1.23 × 104\n60\n149\n1.99 × 104\n70+\n234\n3.12 × 104\n80\n355\n4.73 × 104\n90\n526\n7.01 × 104\n100*\n760\n1.01 × 105\n120\n1489\n1.99 × 105\n150\n3570\n4.76 × 105\n+ Boiling point on summit of Mt.

When the\ntemperature is raised to the point where the saturated vapor pressure at that\ntemperature equals the external pressure, boiling occurs (Fig. 13-25). As the boil-\ning point is approached, tiny bubbles tend to form in the liquid, which indicate\na change from the liquid to the gas phase. However, if the vapor pressure inside\nthe bubbles is less than the external pressure, the bubbles immediately are crushed.\nAs the temperature is increased, the saturated vapor pressure inside a bubble\neventually becomes equal to or exceeds the external air pressure. The bubble will\nthen not collapse but can rise to the surface. Boiling has then begun. A liquid boils\nwhen its saturated vapor pressure equals the external pressure. This occurs for\nwater at a pressure of 1 atm (760 torr) at 100°C, as can be seen from Table 13-3.\nThe boiling point of a liquid depends on the external pressure. At high ele-\nvations, the boiling point of water is somewhat less than at sea level because the\nair pressure is less up there. For example, on the summit of Mt. Everest (8850 m)\nthe air pressure is about one-third of what it is at sea level, and from Table 13-3\nwe can see that water will boil at about 70℃. Cooking food by boiling takes\nlonger at high elevations, because the boiling water is cooking at a lower\ntemperature. Pressure cookers reduce cooking time because they build up a\npressure as high as 2 atm, allowing a higher boiling (and cooking) temperature to\nbe attained (Problem 58 and Fig. 13-32).\nPartial Pressure and Humidity\nWhen we refer to the weather as being dry or humid, we are referring to the\nwater vapor content of the air. In a gas such as air, which is a mixture of several\ntypes of gases, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas\npresent .* By partial pressure, we mean the pressure each gas would exert if it\nalone were present. The partial pressure of water in the air can be as low as zero\nand can vary up to a maximum equal to the saturated vapor pressure of water at\nthe given temperature. Thus, at 20°C, the partial pressure of water cannot exceed\n17.5 torr (see Table 13-3) or about 0.02 atm. The relative humidity is defined as\nthe ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor to the saturated vapor pressure at\na given temperature. It is usually expressed as a percentage:\npartial pressure of H2O\n× 100%.\nRelative humidity =\nsaturated vapor pressure of H2O\nThus, when the humidity is close to 100%, the air holds nearly all the water vapor\nit can.\nEXAMPLE 13-17\nRelative humidity. On a particular hot day, the tempera-\nture is 30°C and the partial pressure of water vapor in the air is 21.0 torr. What\nis the relative humidity?\nAPPROACH From Table 13-3, we see that the saturated vapor pressure of\nwater at 30℃ is 31.8 torr.\nSOLUTION The relative humidity is thus\n21.0 torr\n× 100% = 66%.\n31.8 torr\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHumidity and comfort\nHumans are sensitive to humidity. A relative humidity of 40-50% is generally\noptimum for both health and comfort. High humidity, particularly on a hot day,\nreduces the evaporation of moisture from the skin, which is one of the body's\nvital mechanisms for regulating body temperature. Very low humidity, on the other\nhand, can dry the skin and mucous membranes.\n* For example, 78% (by volume) of air molecules are nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with much smaller\namounts of water vapor, argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases. At an air pressure of 1 atm, oxygen\nexerts a partial pressure of 0.21 atm and nitrogen 0.78 atm.\n380 CHAPTER 13 Temperature and Kinetic Theory\n", 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 23, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Air is saturated with water vapor when the partial pressure of water in the air\nis equal to the saturated vapor pressure at that temperature. If the partial pressure\nof water exceeds the saturated vapor pressure, the air is said to be supersaturated.\nThis situation can occur when a temperature decrease occurs. For example,\nsuppose the temperature is 30°C and the partial pressure of water is 21 torr, which\nrepresents a humidity of 66% as we saw in Example 13-17. Suppose now that the\ntemperature falls to, say, 20°C, as might happen at nightfall. From Table 13-3 we\nsee that the saturated vapor pressure of water at 20°C is 17.5 torr. Hence the\nrelative humidity would be greater than 100%, and the supersaturated air cannot\nhold this much water vapor. The excess water may condense and appear as dew,\nclouds, or as fog or rain (Fig. 13-26).\nWhen air containing a given amount of water is cooled, a temperature is\nreached where the partial pressure of water equals the saturated vapor pressure.\nThis is called the dew point. Measurement of the dew point is the most accurate\nmeans of determining the relative humidity. One method uses a polished metal sur-\nface which is gradually cooled down while in contact with air. The temperature at\nwhich moisture begins to appear on the surface is the dew point, and the partial\npressure of water can then be obtained from saturated vapor pressure Tables. If, for\nexample, on a given day the temperature is 20°C and the dew point is 5℃, then the\npartial pressure of water (Table 13-3) in the 20°℃ air is 6.54 torr, whereas its satu- (b)\nrated vapor pressure is 17.5 torr; hence the relative humidity is 6.54/17.5 = 37%.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nWeather\n(a)\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 13-18\nDryness in winter. Why does the air\ninside heated buildings seem very dry on a cold winter day?\nRESPONSE Suppose the relative humidity outside on a -10℃ day is 50%.\nTable 13-3 tells us the partial pressure of water in the air is about 1.0 torr.\nIf this air is brought indoors and heated to +20℃, the relative humidity is\n(1.0 torr)/(17.5 torr) = 5.7%. Even if the outside air were saturated at a partial\npressure of 1.95 torr, the inside relative humidity would still be at a low 11%.\n*\n13-13 Diffusion\nIf you carefully place a few drops of food coloring in a glass of water as in\nFig. 13-27, you will find that the color spreads throughout the water. The process\nmay take some time (assuming you do not shake the glass), but eventually the\ncolor will become uniform. This mixing, known as diffusion, is readly explained by\nkinetic theory as due to the random movement of the molecules. Diffusion occurs\nin gases too. Common examples include perfume or smoke (or the odor of some-\nthing cooking on a stove) diffusing in air, although convection (moving air currents)\noften plays a greater role in spreading odors than does diffusion. Diffusion\ndepends on concentration, by which we mean the number of molecules or moles\nper unit volume. In general, the diffusing substance moves from a region where\nits concentration is high to a region where its concentration is low.\n(c)\nFIGURE 13-26 (a) Fog or mist\nsettling in a valley where the\ntemperature has dropped below the\ndew point.

Consider a tube of cross-sectional area A containing\nmolecules in a higher concentration on the left than on the right, Fig. 13-28.\nWe assume the molecules are in random motion. Yet there will be a net flow of\nmolecules to the right. To see why, let us consider the small section of tube\nof length Ax as shown. Molecules from both regions 1 and 2 cross into this\ncentral section as a result of their random motion. The more molecules there are\nin a region, the more will strike a given area or cross a boundary. Since there is a\ngreater concentration of molecules in region 1 than in region 2, more molecules\ncross into the central section from region 1 than from region 2. There is, then, a net\nflow of molecules from left to right, from high concentration (C1) toward low\nconcentration (C2). The net flow becomes zero only when the concentrations\nbecome equal.\nWe might expect that the greater the difference in concentration, the greater\nthe flow rate. Indeed, the rate of diffusion, J (number of molecules or moles or\nkg per second), is directly proportional to the difference in concentration per\nunit distance, (C1 - C2)/Ax (which is called the concentration gradient), and to\nthe cross-sectional area A (see Fig. 13-28):\nJ = DA\nC1 - C2\n.\n(13-10)\n4.x\nD is a constant of proportionality called the diffusion constant. Equation 13-10 is\nknown as the diffusion equation, or Fick's law. If the concentrations are given in\nmol/m3, then J is the number of moles passing a given point per second. If the con-\ncentrations are given in kg/m3, then J is the mass movement per second (kg/s).\nThe length Ax is given in meters, and area A in m2. The values of D for a variety\nof substances diffusing in a particular medium are given in Table 13-4.\nEXAMPLE 13-19\nESTIMATE\nDiffusion of ammonia in air. To get an idea\nof the time required for diffusion, estimate how long it might take for ammonia\n(NH3) to be detected 10 cm from a bottle after it is opened, assuming only\ndiffusion is occurring.\nAPPROACH This will be an order-of-magnitude calculation. The rate of diffu-\nsion J can be set equal to the number of molecules N diffusing across area A in\na time t: J = N/t. Then the time t = N/J, where J is given by Eq. 13-10.\nWe will have to make some assumptions and rough approximations about\nconcentrations to use Eq. 13-10.\nSOLUTION Using Eq. 13-10, we find\nt = A = N AX\n.\nDA AC\nThe average concentration (midway between bottle and nose) can be approxi-\nmated by C ~ N/V, where V is the volume over which the molecules move\nand is roughly on the order of V ~ A Ax, where Ax is 10 cm = 0.10 m. We\nsubstitute N = CV = CA Ax into the above equation:\nt\nL\n(CA Ax) Ax\n=\nC (Ax)2\nDA AC\nAC D\n.\nThe concentration of ammonia is high near the bottle (C) and low near the\ndetecting nose (~ 0), so C~ C/2 ~ AC/2, or (C/AC) ~ 2. Since NH3\nmolecules have a size somewhere between H2 and O2, from Table 13-4 we\ncan estimate D ~ 4 × 10-5 m2/s. Then\nt =\n1\n(0.10 m)2\n22\n100 s,\n2\n(4 × 10-5 m2/s)\nor about a minute or two.\nNOTE This result seems rather long from experience, suggesting that air currents\n(convection) are more important than diffusion for transmitting odors.\n382 CHAPTER 13 Temperature and Kinetic Theory\n", 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 25, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Diffusion is extremely important for living organisms. For example, molecules\nproduced in certain chemical reactions within cells diffuse to other areas where\nthey take part in other reactions.\nGas diffusion is important too. Plants require carbon dioxide for photosyn-\nthesis. The CO2 diffuses into leaves from the outside air through tiny openings\n(stomata). As CO2 is utilized by the cells, its concentration drops below that in\nthe air outside, and more diffuses inward. Water vapor and oxygen produced by\nthe cells diffuse outward into the air.\nAnimals also exchange oxygen and CO2 with the environment. Oxygen is\nrequired for energy-producing reactions and must diffuse into cells. CO2 is\nproduced as an end product of many metabolic reactions and must diffuse out of\ncells. But diffusion is slow over longer distances, so only the smallest organisms in\nthe animal world could survive without having developed complex respiratory and\ncirculatory systems. In humans, oxygen is taken into the lungs, where it diffuses\nshort distances across lung tissue and into the blood. Then the blood circulates\nit to cells throughout the body. The blood also carries CO2 produced by the cells\nback to the lungs, where it diffuses outward.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nDiffusion in\nliving organisms\nSummary\nThe atomic theory of matter postulates that all matter is made\nup of tiny entities called atoms, which are typically 10-10 m in\ndiameter.\nAtomic and molecular masses are specified on a scale\nwhere the most common form of carbon (12C) is arbitrarily\ngiven the value 12.0000 u (atomic mass units), exactly.\nThe distinction between solids, liquids, and gases can be\nattributed to the strength of the attractive forces between the\natoms or molecules and to their average speed.\nTemperature is a measure of how hot or cold something\nis. Thermometers are used to measure temperature on the\nCelsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K) scales. Two stan-\ndard points on each scale are the freezing point of water (0℃,\n32°F, 273.15 K) and the boiling point of water (100°℃, 212°F,\n373.15 K). A one-kelvin change in temperature equals a change\nof one Celsius degree or 3 Fahrenheit degrees. Kelvins are\nrelated to ℃ by\nT(K) = T(C) + 273.15.\nWhen two objects at different temperatures are placed in\ncontact, they eventually reach the same temperature and are\nthen said to be in thermal equilibrium.\nThe change in length, Al, of a solid, when its temperature\nchanges by an amount AT, is directly proportional to the\ntemperature change and to its original length l0 . That is,\nAl = alo AT,\n(13-1a)\nwhere a is the coefficient of linear expansion.\nThe change in volume of most solids, liquids, and gases is\nproportional to the temperature change and to the original\nvolume V0 :\nAV = BVO AT.\n(13-2)\nThe coefficient of volume expansion, B, is approximately equal\nto 3a for uniform solids.\nWater is unusual because, unlike most materials whose\nvolume increases with temperature, its volume in the range from\n0℃ to 4℃ actually decreases as the temperature increases.\nThe ideal gas law, or equation of state for an ideal gas,\nrelates the pressure P, volume V, and temperature T (in kelvins)\nof n moles of gas by the equation\nPV = nRT,\n(13-3)\nwhere R = 8.314 J/mol · K for all gases. Real gases obey the\nideal gas law quite accurately if they are not at too high a pres-\nsure or near their liquefaction point.\nOne mole is that amount of a substance whose mass in\ngrams is numerically equal to the atomic or molecular mass of\nthat substance.\nAvogadro's number, NA = 6.02 × 1023, is the number of\natoms or molecules in 1 mol of any pure substance.\nThe ideal gas law can be written in terms of the number of\nmolecules N in the gas as\nPV = NkT,\n(13-4)\nwhere k = R/NA = 1.38 × 10-23 J/K is Boltzmann's constant.\nAccording to the kinetic theory of gases, which is based on\nthe idea that a gas is made up of molecules that are moving\nrapidly and randomly, the average translational kinetic energy\nof molecules is proportional to the Kelvin temperature T:\nKE = {mv2 = {kT,\n(13-8)\nwhere k is Boltzmann's constant. At any moment, there exists\na wide distribution of molecular speeds within a gas.\nThe behavior of real gases at high pressure, and/or when\nnear their liquefaction point, deviates from the ideal gas law\ndue to the attractive forces between molecules. Below the\ncritical temperature, a gas can change to a liquid if sufficient\npressure is applied; but if the temperature is higher than the\ncritical temperature, no amount of pressure will cause a liquid\nsurface to form. The triple point of a substance is that unique\ntemperature and pressure at which all three phases-solid,\nliquid, and gas-can coexist in equilibrium.\nEvaporation of a liquid is the result of the fastest moving\nmolecules escaping from the surface. Saturated vapor pressure\nrefers to the pressure of the vapor above a liquid when the two\nphases are in equilibrium. The vapor pressure of a substance\n(such as water) depends strongly on temperature, and at the\nboiling point is equal to atmospheric pressure. Relative humidity\nof air is the ratio of the actual partial pressure of water vapor in\nthe air to the saturated vapor pressure at that temperature; it is\nusually expressed as a percentage.\n[*Diffusion is the process whereby molecules of a sub-\nstance move (on average) from one area to another because of\na difference in that substance's concentration.]\nSummary 383\n", 'chapter_title': '13-4 Thermal Expansion'}, {'page_number': 26, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Questions\n1.
