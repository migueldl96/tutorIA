The sound is made by the vibration of the\npiano string and is propagated outward as a vibration of the air (which can reach\nyour ear). How does the vibration on the string compare to the vibration in the air?\n(a) The vibration on the string and the vibration in the air have the same wavelength.\n(b) They have the same frequency.\n(c) They have the same speed.\n(d) Neither wavelength, frequency, nor speed are the same in the air as on the string.\nound is associated with our sense of hearing and, therefore, with the physi-\nology of our ears and the psychology of our brain, which interprets the\nsensations that reach our ears. The term sound also refers to the physical\nsensation that stimulates our ears: namely, longitudinal pressure waves.\nS\nWe can distinguish three aspects of any sound. First, there must be a source\nfor a sound; as with any mechanical wave, the source of a sound wave is a vibrating\nobject. Second, the energy is transferred from the source in the form of longitu-\ndinal sound waves in air or other material. And third, the sound is detected, usually\nby an ear or by a microphone. We start by looking at sound waves themselves.\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound\nWe saw in Chapter 11, Fig. 11-26, how a vibrating drumhead produces a sound\nwave in air. Indeed, we usually think of sound waves traveling in the air, because\nnormally it is the vibrations of the air that force our eardrums to vibrate. But sound\nwaves can also travel in other materials.\nTwo stones struck together under water can be heard by a swimmer beneath\nthe surface, for the vibrations are carried to the ear by the water. When you put\nyour ear flat against the ground, you can hear an approaching train or truck. In\nthis case the ground does not actually touch your eardrum, but the longitudinal\nwave transmitted by the ground is called a sound wave just the same, since its vibra-\ntions cause the outer ear and the air within it to vibrate. Sound cannot travel in\nthe absence of matter. For example, a bell ringing inside an evacuated jar cannot\nbe heard, and sound cannot travel through the empty reaches of outer space.\nThe speed of sound is different in different materials. In air at 0℃ and 1 atm,\nsound travels at a speed of 331 m/s. The speed of sound in various materials is\ngiven in Table 12-1. The values depend somewhat on temperature, especially for\ngases. For example, in air near room temperature, the speed increases approxi-\nmately 0.60 m/s for each Celsius degree increase in temperature:\nv ~ (331 + 0.60T) m/s,\n[speed of sound in air]\nwhere T is the temperature in °C. Unless stated otherwise, we will assume in this\nChapter that T = 20℃, so v = [331 + (0.60)(20)] m/s = 343 m/s.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 12-1\nDistance from a lightning strike. A rule\nof thumb that tells how close lightning has struck is "one mile for every five seconds\nbefore the thunder is heard." Explain why this works, noting that the speed of\nlight is so high (3 × 108 m/s, almost a million times faster than sound) that the\ntime for light to travel to us is negligible compared to the time for the sound.\nRESPONSE The speed of sound in air is about 340 m/s, so to travel\n1 km = 1000 m takes about 3 seconds. One mile is about 1.6 kilometers, so the\ntime for the thunder to travel a mile is about (1.6)(3) ~ 5 seconds.\nTwo aspects of any sound are immediately evident to a human listener:\n"loudness" and "pitch." Each refers to a sensation in the consciousness of the\nlistener. But to each of these subjective sensations there corresponds a physically\nmeasurable quantity. Loudness is related to the intensity (energy per unit time\ncrossing unit area) in the sound wave, and we shall discuss it in the next Section.\nThe pitch of a sound refers to whether it is high, like the sound of a piccolo or\nviolin, or low, like the sound of a bass drum or string bass. The physical quantity\nthat determines pitch is the frequency, as was first noted by Galileo. The lower the\nfrequency, the lower the pitch; the higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.+ The\nbest human ears can respond to frequencies from about 20 Hz to almost 20,000 Hz.\n(Recall that 1 Hz is 1 cycle per second.) This frequency range is called the audible range.\nThese limits vary somewhat from one individual to another. One general trend is\nthat as people age, they are less able to hear high frequencies, so the high-frequency\nlimit may be 10,000 Hz or less.\nSound waves whose frequencies are outside the audible range may reach the\near, but we are not generally aware of them. Frequencies above 20,000 Hz are called\nultrasonic (do not confuse with supersonic, which is used for an object moving with\na speed faster than the speed of sound). Many animals can hear ultrasonic frequen-\ncies; dogs, for example, can hear sounds as high as 50,000 Hz, and bats can detect\nfrequencies as high as 100,000 Hz. Ultrasonic waves have many useful applications\nin medicine and other fields, which we will discuss later in this Chapter.\nTABLE 12-1 Speed of\nSound in Various Materials\n(20°℃ and 1 atm)\nMaterial\nSpeed (m/s)\nAir\n343\nAir (0℃)\n331\nHelium\n1005\nHydrogen\n1300\nWater\n1440\nSea water\n1560\nIron and steel\n≥5000\nGlass\n~4500\nAluminum\n~5100\nHardwood\n≥4000\nConcrete\n~3000\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHow far away is the lightning?\nCAUTION\nDo not confuse\nultrasonic (high frequency)\nwith supersonic (high speed)\n+ Although pitch is determined mainly by frequency, it also depends to a slight extent on loudness.

Sound waves can also be analyzed from the point of view of\npressure. Indeed, longitudinal waves are often called pressure waves. The pressure\nvariation is usually easier to measure than the displacement. As Fig. 12-2 shows,\nin a wave "compression" (where molecules are closest together), the pressure is\nhigher than normal, whereas in an expansion (or rarefaction) the pressure is less\nthan normal. Figure 12-3 shows a graphical representation of a sound wave in air\nin terms of (a) displacement and (b) pressure. Note that the displacement wave is\na quarter wavelength out of phase with the pressure wave: where the pressure is a\nmaximum or minimum, the displacement from equilibrium is zero; and where the\npressure variation is zero, the displacement is a maximum or minimum.\nSound waves whose frequencies are below the audible range (that is, less than\n20 Hz) are called infrasonic. Sources of infrasonic waves include earthquakes,\nthunder, volcanoes, and waves produced by vibrating heavy machinery. This last\nsource can be particularly troublesome to workers, because infrasonic waves-even\nthough inaudible-can cause damage to the human body. These low-frequency waves\nact in a resonant fashion, causing motion and irritation of the body\'s organs.\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': '12-2 Intensity of Sound: Decibels\nLoudness is a sensation in the consciousness of a human being and is related to\na physically measurable quantity, the intensity of the wave. Intensity is defined\nas the energy transported by a wave per unit time across a unit area perpendicular to\nthe energy flow. As we saw in Chapter 11, intensity is proportional to the square of the\nwave amplitude. Intensity has units of power per unit area, or watts/meter2 (W/m2).\nAn average human ear can detect sounds with an intensity as low as\n10-12 W/m2 and as high as 1 W/m2 (and even higher, although above this it is\npainful). This is an incredibly wide range of intensity, spanning a factor of 1012\nfrom lowest to highest. Presumably because of this wide range, what we perceive\nas loudness is not directly proportional to the intensity. To produce a sound that\nsounds about twice as loud requires a sound wave that has about 10 times the\nintensity. This is roughly valid at any sound level for frequencies near the middle\nof the audible range. For example, a sound wave of intensity 10-2 W/m2 sounds\nto an average human being like it is about twice as loud as one with intensity of\n10-3 W/m2, and four times as loud as 10-4 W/m2.\nSound Level\nBecause of this relationship between the subjective sensation of loudness and the phys-\nically measurable quantity "intensity," sound intensity levels are usually specified on a\nlogarithmic scale. The unit on this scale is a bel, after the inventor Alexander Graham\nBell, or much more commonly, the decibel (dB), which is 10 bel (10 dB = 1 bel).+ The\nsound level, B, of any sound is defined in terms of its intensity, I, as\nI\nß (in dB) = 10 log\nI0\n,\n(12-1)\nwhere I0 is the intensity of a chosen reference level, and the logarithm is to the\nbase 10. Io is usually taken as the minimum intensity audible to a good ear-the\n"threshold of hearing," which is Io = 1.0 × 10-12 W/m2. Thus, for example,\nthe sound level of a sound whose intensity I = 1.0 × 10-10 W/m2 will be\n-\n1.0 × 10-10 W/m2\n-\nß = 10 log\n= 10 log 100 = 20 dB,\n1.0 × 10-12 W/m2\nsince log 100 is equal to 2.0. (Appendix A has a brief review of logarithms.)\nNotice that the sound level at the threshold of hearing is 0 dB. That is,\nB = 10 log 10-12/10-12 = 10 log 1 = 0 since log 1 = 0. Notice too that an increase\nin intensity by a factor of 10 corresponds to a sound level increase of 10 dB. An\nincrease in intensity by a factor of 100 corresponds to a sound level increase of\n20 dB. Thus a 50-dB sound is 100 times more intense than a 30-dB sound, and so on.\nIntensities and sound levels for some common sounds are listed in Table 12-2.\nEXAMPLE 12-3\nSound intensity on the street. At a busy street corner,\nthe sound level is 75 dB.

A high-quality loudspeaker is\nadvertised to reproduce, at full volume, frequencies from 30 Hz to 18,000 Hz with\nuniform sound level + 3 dB. That is, over this frequency range, the sound level\noutput does not vary by more than 3 dB for a given input level. By what factor\ndoes the intensity change for a 3 dB change in output level?\nAPPROACH Let us call the average intensity I1 and the average sound level ß1 .\nThen the maximum intensity, I2, corresponds to a level B2 = B1 + 3 dB. We\nthen use the relation between intensity and sound level, Eq. 12-1.\nSOLUTION Equation 12-1 gives\nB2 - B1 = 10 log\nI0\nI2\n- 10 log\nI\nI0\nI2\n- log\nI1\nI0\n=\nI\nb\n10 log-\nI2\n3 dB = 10 log\nbecause (log a - log b) = log a/b, as discussed in Appendix A-8.

See also the short\nTable of Logarithms in Appendix A-8.\nEXERCISE A If an increase of 3 dB means "twice as intense," what does an increase of\n6 dB mean?\nIt is worth noting that a sound-level difference of 3 dB (which corresponds to\na doubled intensity, as we just saw) corresponds to only a very small change in\nthe subjective sensation of apparent loudness. Indeed, the average human can\ndistinguish a difference in sound level of only about 1 or 2 dB.\nNormally, the loudness or intensity of a sound decreases as you get farther\nfrom the source of the sound. Indoors, this effect is altered because of reflections\nfrom the walls. However, if a source is in the open so that sound can radiate out\nfreely in all directions, the intensity decreases as the inverse square of the distance,\n1 x 4 ,\nas we saw in Section 11-9. Over large distances, the intensity decreases faster\nthan 1/r2 because some of the energy is transferred into irregular motion of air\nmolecules. This loss happens more for higher frequencies, so any sound of mixed\nfrequencies will be less "bright" at a distance. Far from an outdoor band, you hear\nmainly the boom of the drums.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 12-5\nTrumpet players. A trumpeter plays at a\nsound level of 75 dB. Three equally loud trumpet players join in. What is the new\nsound level?\nRESPONSE The intensity of four trumpets is four times the intensity of one\ntrumpet (= I1) or 4/1 . The sound level of the four trumpets would be\nB = 10 log\n4I1\n= 10 log 4 + 10 log\nI1\nI0\nI0\n= 6.0 dB + 75 dB = 81 dB,\nsince log 4 = 0.60.\nEXERCISE B From Table 12-2, we see that ordinary conversation corresponds to a\nsound level of about 65 dB. If two people are talking at once, the sound level is\n(a) 65 dB, (b) 68 dB, (c) 75 dB, (d) 130 dB, (e) 62 dB.\n332 CHAPTER 12 Sound\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 12-6\nAirplane roar. The sound level measured 30 m from a jet\nplane is 140 dB. Estimate the sound level at 300 m. (Ignore reflections from the\nground.)\nAPPROACH Given the sound level, we can determine the intensity at 30 m using\nEq. 12-1. Because intensity decreases as the square of the distance, ignoring\nreflections, we can find I at 300 m and again apply Eq. 12-1 to obtain the sound\nlevel.\nSOLUTION The intensity I at 30 m is\nI\n140 dB = 10 log\n10-12 W/m2\nor, dividing through by 10,\nI\n14 = log\n10-12 W/m2\nRecall that y = log x means 10y = x (Appendix A-8). Then\n1014 =\nI\n10-12 W/m2\n,\nso I = (1014)(10-12 W/m2) = 102 W/m2. At 300 m, 10 times as far, the intensity,\nwhich decreases as 1/r2, will be (10) = 1/100 as much, or 1 W/m2. Hence, the\nsound level is\n1 W/m2\n₿ = 10 log\n10-12 W/m2\n= 120 dB.\nEven at 300 m, the sound is at the threshold of pain. This is why workers at air-\nports wear ear covers to protect their ears from damage (Fig. 12-4).\nNOTE Here is a simpler approach that avoids Eq. 12-1. Because the intensity\ndecreases as the square of the distance, at 10 times the distance the intensity\ndecreases by (10) = 100 . We can use the result that 10 dB corresponds to\nan intensity change by a factor of 10 (see just before Example 12-3). Then an\nintensity change by a factor of 100 corresponds to a sound-level change of\n(2)(10 dB) = 20 dB. This confirms our result above: 140 dB - 20 dB = 120 dB.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nJet plane noise\nFIGURE 12-4 Example 12-6.\nAirport worker with sound-intensity-\nreducing ear covers (headphones).\nIntensity Related to Amplitude\nThe intensity I of a wave is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude, A,\nas we saw in Section 11-9.

Mechanical detectors\nof sound (microphones) can barely match the ear in detecting low-intensity\nsounds.\nThe function of the ear is to transform the vibrational energy of waves into\nelectrical signals which are carried to the brain by way of nerves. A microphone\nperforms a similar task. Sound waves striking the diaphragm of a microphone set\nit into vibration, and these vibrations are transformed into an electrical signal\n(Chapter 21) with the same frequencies, which can then be amplified and sent to\na loudspeaker or recorder.\nFigure 12-5 is a diagram of the human ear. The ear consists of three main\ndivisions: the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. In the outer ear, sound waves\nfrom the outside travel down the ear canal to the eardrum (the tympanum), which\nvibrates in response to the impinging waves. The middle ear consists of three small\nbones known as the hammer, anvil, and stirrup, which transfer the vibrations of\nthe eardrum to the inner ear at the oval window. This delicate system of levers,\ncoupled with the relatively large area of the eardrum compared to the area of\nthe oval window, results in the pressure being amplified by a factor of about 20.\nThe inner ear consists of the semicircular canals, which are important for control-\nling balance, and the liquid-filled cochlea where the vibrational energy of sound\nwaves is transformed into electrical energy and sent to the brain.\nStirrup\nAnvil\nHammer\nSemicircular\ncanals\nAuditory nerve\n(to brain)\nCochlea\nEar\ncanal (eardrum)\nTympanum\nOval window\nFIGURE 12-5 Diagram of the human ear.\n*The Ear's Response\nThe ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies. To hear the same loudness for\nsounds of different frequencies requires different intensities. Studies on large\nnumbers of people have produced the averaged curves shown in Fig. 12-6 (top of\nnext page). On this graph, each curve represents sounds that seemed to be equally\nloud. The number labeling each curve represents the loudness level (the units are\ncalled phons), which is numerically equal to the sound level in dB at 1000 Hz. For\nexample, the curve labeled 40 represents sounds that are heard by an average\nperson to have the same loudness as a 1000-Hz sound with a sound level of 40 dB.\nFrom this 40-phon curve, we see that a 100-Hz tone must be at a level of about\n62 dB to be perceived as loud as a 1000-Hz tone of only 40 dB.\n334 CHAPTER 12 Sound\n", 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Intensity (W/m2)\nThreshold of pain\n120 phons\n120\n1\n100\n100\n10-2\n80\n80\n10-4\nSound level (dB)\n60\n60\n10-6\n40\n40\n10-8\nThreshold of hearing\n20\n20\n10-10\n0\n0\n10-12\n20\n50 100\n500 1000\n5000 10,000\nFrequency (Hz)\nFIGURE 12-6 Sensitivity of the human ear as a function of\nfrequency (see text).

Note that the ear is most sensitive to sounds of fre-\nquency between 2000 and 4000 Hz, which are common in speech and music. Note\ntoo that whereas a 1000-Hz sound is audible at a level of 0 dB, a 100-Hz sound\nmust be nearly 40 dB to be heard. The top curve in Fig. 12-6, labeled 120 phons,\nrepresents the threshold of pain. Sounds above this level can actually be felt and\ncause pain.\nFigure 12-6 shows that at lower sound levels, our ears are less sensitive to the\nhigh and low frequencies relative to middle frequencies. The "loudness" control\non some stereo systems is intended to compensate for this low-volume insensitivity.\nAs the volume is turned down, the loudness control boosts the high and low\nfrequencies relative to the middle frequencies so that the sound will have a more\n"normal-sounding" frequency balance. Many listeners, however, find the sound\nmore pleasing or natural without the loudness control.\n12-4 Sources of Sound: Vibrating\nStrings and Air Columns\nThe source of any sound is a vibrating object. Almost any object can vibrate and\nhence be a source of sound. We now discuss some simple sources of sound, partic-\nularly musical instruments. In musical instruments, the source is set into vibration\nby striking, plucking, bowing, or blowing. Standing waves are produced and the\nsource vibrates at its natural resonant frequencies. The vibrating source is in contact\nwith the air (or other medium) and pushes on it to produce sound waves that travel\noutward. The frequencies of the waves are the same as those of the source, but\nthe speed and wavelengths can be different. A drum has a stretched membrane\nthat vibrates. Xylophones and marimbas have metal or wood bars that can be\nset into vibration. Bells, cymbals, and gongs also make use of a vibrating metal.\nMany instruments make use of vibrating strings, such as the violin, guitar, and\npiano, or make use of vibrating columns of air, such as the flute, trumpet, and\npipe organ. We have already seen that the pitch of a pure sound is determined\nby the frequency.

Such standing waves are the basis for all\nstringed instruments. The pitch is normally determined by the lowest resonant\nfrequency, the fundamental, which corresponds to nodes occurring only at the\nends. The string vibrating up and down as a whole corresponds to a half wave-\nlength as shown at the top of Fig. 12-7; so the wavelength of the fundamental on\nthe string is equal to twice the length & of the string. Therefore, the fundamental\nfrequency is f1 = v/> = v/20, where v is the velocity of the wave on the string\n(not in the air). The possible frequencies for standing waves on a stretched string\nare whole-number multiples of the fundamental frequency:\nfn = nf1 = n 2, n = 1, 2, 3, ...\n(just as in Eq. 11-19b), where n = 1 refers to the fundamental and n = 2, 3, ··· are\nthe overtones. All of the standing waves, n = 1, 2, 3, ... , are called harmonics+,\nas we saw in Section 11-12.\nWhen a finger is placed on the string of a guitar or violin, the effective length\nof the vibrating string is shortened. So its fundamental frequency, and pitch, is\nhigher since the wavelength of the fundamental is shorter (Fig. 12-8). The strings\non a guitar or violin are all the same length. They sound at a different pitch\nbecause the strings have different mass per unit length, u = m/l, which affects\nthe velocity on the string, Eq. 11-13,\nv = VFT/M.\n[stretched string]\nThus the velocity on a heavier string is lower and the frequency will be lower for\nthe same wavelength. The tension Fr also has an effect: indeed, adjusting the ten-\nsion is the means for tuning the pitch of each string. In pianos and harps the strings\nare of different lengths. For the lower notes the strings are not only longer, but\nheavier as well, and the reason is illustrated in the following Example.\nEXAMPLE 12-8\nPiano strings. The highest key on a piano corresponds to a\nfrequency about 150 times that of the lowest key. If the string for the highest note\nis 5.0 cm long, how long would the string for the lowest note have to be if it had\nthe same mass per unit length and was under the same tension?\nAPPROACH Since v = VFr/u, the velocity would be the same on each\nstring. So the frequency is inversely proportional to the length l of the string\n(f = v/>= v/2l).\nSOLUTION We can write, for the fundamental frequencies of each string, the ratio\nIL/PH = fH/fL,\nwhere the subscripts L and H refer to the lowest and highest notes, respectively.\nThus &L = &H(fH/fL) = (5.0 cm)(150) = 750 cm, or 7.5 m. This would be ridic-\nulously long (~ 25 ft) for a piano.\nNOTE The longer strings of lower frequency are made heavier (higher mass per\nunit length), so even on grand pianos the strings are less than 3 m long.\n*When the resonant frequencies above the fundamental (that is, the overtones) are integral multiples of\nthe fundamental, as here, they are called harmonics. But if the overtones are not integral multiples\nof the fundamental, as is the case for a vibrating drumhead, for example, they are not harmonics.\n336 CHAPTER 12 Sound\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': '| EXERCISE C How many octaves does the piano of Example 12-8 cover?\nEXAMPLE 12-9\nFrequencies and wavelengths in the violin. A 0.32-m-long\nviolin string is tuned to play A above middle C at 440 Hz. (a) What is the wave-\nlength of the fundamental string vibration, and (b) what are the frequency and\nwavelength of the sound wave produced? (c) Why is there a difference?\nAPPROACH The wavelength of the fundamental string vibration equals twice\nthe length of the string (Fig. 12-7). As the string vibrates, it pushes on the air,\nwhich is thus forced to oscillate at the same frequency as the string.\nSOLUTION (a) From Fig. 12-7 the wavelength of the fundamental is\n1 = 20 = 2(0.32 m) = 0.64 m = 64 cm.\nThis is the wavelength of the standing wave on the string.\n(b) The sound wave that travels outward in the air (to reach our ears) has the\nsame frequency, 440 Hz. Its wavelength is\n1 = 2 = 40 Hz\n343 m/s\n= 0.78 m = 78 cm,\nwhere v is the speed of sound in air (assumed at 20℃), Section 12-1.\n(c) The wavelength of the sound wave is different from that of the standing wave\non the string because the speed of sound in air (343 m/s at 20℃) is different\nfrom the speed of the wave on the string (= f) = 440 Hz × 0.64 m = 280 m/s)\nwhich depends on the tension in the string and its mass per unit length.\n(a)\nNOTE The frequencies on the string and in the air are the same: the string and\nair are in contact, and the string "forces" the air to vibrate at the same fre-\nquency. But the wavelengths are different because the wave speed on the string\nis different than that in air.\nEXERCISE D Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 328, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nStringed instruments would not be very loud if they relied on their vibrating\nstrings to produce the sound waves since the strings are too thin to compress and\nexpand much air. Stringed instruments therefore make use of a kind of mechanical\namplifier known as a sounding board (piano) or sounding box (guitar, violin), which\nacts to amplify the sound by putting a greater surface area in contact with the air\n(Fig. 12-9). When the strings are set into vibration, the sounding board or box is set\ninto vibration as well. Since it has much greater area in contact with the air, it can\nproduce a more intense sound wave. On an electric guitar, the sounding box is not\nso important since the vibrations of the strings are amplified electronically.\nWind Instruments\nInstruments such as woodwinds, the brasses, and the pipe organ produce sound\nfrom the vibrations of standing waves in a column of air within a tube (Fig. 12-10).\nStanding waves can occur in the air of any cavity, including the human throat, but\nthe frequencies present are complicated for any but very simple shapes such as the\nuniform, narrow tube of a flute or an organ pipe. In some instruments, a vibrating\nreed or the vibrating lip of the player helps to set up vibrations of the air column. In\nothers, a stream of air is directed against one edge of the opening or mouthpiece,\nleading to turbulence which sets up the vibrations. Because of the disturbance,\nwhatever its source, the air within the tube vibrates with a variety of frequencies,\nbut only frequencies that correspond to standing waves will persist.\nFor a string fixed at both ends, Fig. 12-7, the standing waves have nodes (no\nmovement) at the two ends, and one or more antinodes (large amplitude of vibration)\nin between. A node separates successive antinodes. The lowest-frequency standing\nwave, the fundamental, corresponds to a single antinode. The higher-frequency\nstanding waves are called overtones or harmonics, as we saw in Section 11-12.\nSpecifically, the first harmonic is the fundamental, the second harmonic (= first\novertone) has twice the frequency of the fundamental, and so on.\n(b)\nFIGURE 12-9 (a) Piano, showing\nsounding board to which strings are\nattached; (b) sounding box (guitar).\nFIGURE 12-10 Wind instruments:\nflute (left) and clarinet.\nSECTION 12-4 337\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'TUBE OPEN AT BOTH ENDS\n(a) Displacement of air\nl\nA\nantinode\nnode\nB\nA\nB\nA\nB\nFIGURE 12-11 Graphs of the\nthree simplest modes of vibration\n(standing waves) for a uniform tube\nopen at both ends ("open tube").\nThese simplest modes of vibration\nare graphed in (a), on the left, in\nterms of the motion of the air\n(displacement), and in (b), on the\nright, in terms of air pressure.

We can describe the\nwaves either in terms of the flow of the air-that is, in terms of the displacement\nof air-or in terms of the pressure in the air (see Figs. 12-2 and 12-3). In terms of\ndisplacement, the air at the closed end of a tube is a displacement node since the\nair is not free to move there, whereas near the open end of a tube there will be\nan antinode because the air can move freely in and out. The air within the tube\nvibrates in the form of longitudinal standing waves. A few of the possible modes\nof vibration for a tube open at both ends (called an open tube) are shown graphi-\ncally in Fig. 12-11. Possible vibration modes for a tube that is open at one end but\nclosed at the other (called a closed tube) are shown in Fig. 12-12. [A tube closed\nat both ends, having no connection to the outside air, would be useless as an\ninstrument.] The graphs in part (a) of each Figure (left-hand sides) represent the\ndisplacement amplitude of the vibrating air in the tube. Note that these are graphs,\nand that the air molecules themselves oscillate horizontally, parallel to the tube\nlength, as shown by the small arrows in the top diagram of Fig. 12-11a (on the\nleft). The exact position of the antinode near the open end of a tube depends on\nthe diameter of the tube, but if the diameter is small compared to the length,\nwhich is the usual case, the antinode occurs very close to the end as shown.+ We\nassume this is the case in what follows. (The position of the antinode may also\ndepend slightly on the wavelength and other factors.)\nLet us look in detail at the open tube, in Fig. 12-11a, which might be an\norgan pipe or a flute. An open tube has displacement antinodes at both ends\nsince the air is free to move at open ends. There must be at least one node within\nan open tube if there is to be a standing wave at all. A single node corresponds to\nthe fundamental frequency of the tube. Since the distance between two successive\nnodes, or between two successive antinodes, is 2A, there is one-half of a wave-\nlength within the length of the tube for the simplest case of the fundamental (top\ndiagram in Fig. 12-11a): l = {\\, or > = 20. So the fundamental frequency is\nf1= v/> = v/20, where v is the velocity of sound in air (the air in the tube). The\nstanding wave with two nodes is the first overtone or second harmonic and has\nhalf the wavelength (l = >) and twice the frequency of the fundamental. Indeed,\nin a uniform tube open at both ends, the frequency of each overtone is an integral\nmultiple of the fundamental frequency, as shown in Fig. 12-11a. This is just what\nis found for a string.\n*The diameter D of a tube does affect the node at the open end of a tube. The end correction can be\nroughly approximated as adding D/3 to & to give us an effective length for the tube in calculations.\n338 CHAPTER 12 Sound\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'TUBE CLOSED AT ONE END\n(a) Displacement of air\nl\nA\nB\nA\nFirst harmonic = fundamental\ne = = 11\nfi = 44\n(b) Pressure variation in the air\nl\nA\nB\nA\nThird harmonic\nl=2 13\nB\nf3 = 40 = 3f1\nOvertones\nFifth harmonic\nA\ne = 15\nB\nf5 = 60 = 5f1\nL\nFor a closed tube, shown in Fig. 12-12a, which could be an organ pipe, there\nis always a displacement node at the closed end (because the air is not free to\nmove) and an antinode at the open end (where the air can move freely). Since the\ndistance between a node and the nearest antinode is 4À, we see that the funda-\nmental in a closed tube corresponds to only one-fourth of a wavelength within the\nlength of the tube: l = 1/4, and > = 40. The fundamental frequency is thus\nf1 = v/4l, or half that for an open pipe of the same length. There is another\ndifference, for as we can see from Fig. 12-12a, only the odd harmonics are present\nin a closed tube: the overtones have frequencies equal to 3, 5, 7, ··· times the\nfundamental frequency. There is no way for waves with 2, 4, 6, ··· times the funda-\nmental frequency to have a node at one end and an antinode at the other, and\nthus they cannot exist as standing waves in a closed tube.\nAnother way to analyze the vibrations in a uniform tube is to consider a\ndescription in terms of the pressure in the air, shown in part (b) of Figs. 12-11 and\n12-12 (right-hand sides). Where the air in a wave is compressed, the pressure is\nhigher, whereas in a wave expansion (or rarefaction), the pressure is less than normal.\nThe open end of a tube is open to the atmosphere. Hence the pressure variation\nat an open end must be a node: the pressure does not alternate, but remains at\nthe outside atmospheric pressure. If a tube has a closed end, the pressure at that\nclosed end can readily alternate to be above or below atmospheric pressure.\nHence there is a pressure antinode at a closed end of a tube. There can be pressure nodes\nand antinodes within the tube. Some of the possible vibrational modes in terms of\npressure are shown in Fig. 12-11b for an open tube, and in Fig. 12-12b for a closed tube.\nA\nB\nA\nB\nFIGURE 12-12 Modes of vibration\n(standing waves) for a tube closed at\none end ("closed tube").

A flute acts as an open tube, for it is open not only where you blow\ninto it, but is open also at the opposite end. The different notes on a flute are\nobtained by shortening the length of the vibrating air column, by uncovering holes\nalong the tube (so a displacement antinode can occur at the hole). The shorter\nthe length of the vibrating air column, the higher the fundamental frequency.\nEXAMPLE 12-11\nFlute. A flute is designed to play middle C (262 Hz) as the\nfundamental frequency when all the holes are covered. Approximately how long\nshould the distance be from the mouthpiece to the far end of the flute? (This is\nonly approximate since the antinode does not occur precisely at the mouthpiece.)\nAssume the temperature is 20°C.\nAPPROACH When all holes are covered, the length of the vibrating air column\nis the full length. The speed of sound in air at 20℃ is 343 m/s. Because a flute is\nopen at both ends, we use Fig. 12-11: the fundamental frequency f1 is related\nto the length & of the vibrating air column by f = v/2l.\nSOLUTION Solving for l, we find\ne = " ==\n343 m/s\n=\n0.655 m.\n2f\n2(262 s-1)\nEXERCISE E To see why players of wind instruments "warm up" their instruments (so\nthey will be in tune), determine the fundamental frequency of the flute of Example 12-11\nwhen all holes are covered and the temperature is 10℃ instead of 20°℃.\nEXAMPLE 12-12\nESTIMATE\nWind noise frequencies. Wind can be noisy-\nit can "howl" in trees; it can "moan" in chimneys. What is causing the noise, and\nabout what range of frequencies would you expect to hear?\nAPPROACH Gusts of air in the wind cause vibrations or oscillations of the tree\nlimb (or air column in the chimney), which produce sound waves of the same\nfrequency. The end of a tree limb fixed to the tree trunk is a node, whereas the\nother end is free to move and therefore is an antinode; the tree limb is thus about\n4 (Fig. 12-13).\nSOLUTION We estimate v ~ 4000 m/s for the speed of sound in wood\n(Table 12-1). Suppose that a tree limb has length & ~ 2 m; then > = 40 = 8 m\nand f=v/>=(4000m/s)/(8m) ~ 500 Hz.\nNOTE Wind can excite air oscillations in a chimney, much like in an organ pipe\nor flute. A chimney is a fairly long tube, perhaps 3 m in length, acting like a tube\nopen at either one end or even both ends. If open at both ends () = 20), with\nv ~ 340 m/s, we find f1 ~ ~ /20 ~ 57 Hz, which is a fairly low note-no\nwonder chimneys "moan"!\n*\n12-5 Quality of Sound, and Noise;\nSuperposition\nWhenever we hear a sound, particularly a musical sound, we are aware of its\nloudness, its pitch, and also of a third aspect called "quality." For example, when a\npiano and then a flute play a note of the same loudness and pitch (say, middle C),\nthere is a clear difference in the overall sound. We would never mistake a piano\nfor a flute. This is what is meant by the quality of a sound. For musical instruments,\nthe terms timbre and tone color are also used.\nJust as loudness and pitch can be related to physically measurable quantities,\nso too can quality. The quality of a sound depends on the presence of overtones-\ntheir number and their relative amplitudes. Generally, when a note is played on a\nmusical instrument, the fundamental as well as overtones are present simultaneously.\nFigure 12-14 illustrates how the principle of superposition (Section 11-11) applies\nto three wave forms, in this case the fundamental and first two overtones (with\nparticular amplitudes): they add together at each point to give a composite waveform.\n340 CHAPTER 12 Sound\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'By "waveform" we mean the shape of the wave in space at a given moment. Nor-\nmally, more than two overtones are present. [Any complex wave can be analyzed\ninto a superposition of sinusoidal waves of appropriate amplitudes, wavelengths,\nand frequencies. Such an analysis is called a Fourier analysis.]\nThe relative amplitudes of the overtones for a given note are different for\ndifferent musical instruments, which is what gives each instrument its characteristic\nquality or timbre. A bar graph showing the relative amplitudes of the harmonics\nfor a given note produced by an instrument is called a sound spectrum. Several\ntypical examples for different musical instruments are shown in Fig. 12-15. The\nfundamental usually has the greatest amplitude, and its frequency is what is heard\nas the pitch.\n1.0-\n1.0\n1.0-\nClarinet\nPiano\nRelative\namplitude\n0.5-\nRelative\namplitude\n0.5\nRelative\namplitude\n0.5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1000 2000 3000\nFrequency (Hz)\n0\n2000\n3000\n1000\n0\nViolin\n1000 2000 3000\nFrequency (Hz)\nFrequency (Hz)\nThe manner in which an instrument is played strongly influences the sound\nquality. Plucking a violin string, for example, makes a very different sound than\npulling a bow across it. The sound spectrum at the very start (or end) of a note (as\nwhen a hammer strikes a piano string) can be very different from the subsequent\nsustained tone. This too affects the subjective tone quality of an instrument.\nAn ordinary sound, like that made by striking two stones together, is a noise\nthat has a certain quality, but a clear pitch is not discernible. Such a noise is a\nmixture of many frequencies which bear little relation to one another. A sound\nspectrum made of that noise would not show discrete lines like those of Fig. 12-15.\nInstead it would show a continuous, or nearly continuous, spectrum of frequencies.\nSuch a sound we call "noise" in comparison with the more harmonious sounds\nwhich contain frequencies that are simple multiples of the fundamental.\n12-6 Interference of Sound Waves;\nBeats\nFIGURE 12-15 Sound spectra for\ndifferent instruments. The spectra\nchange when the instruments play\ndifferent notes. The clarinet is a bit\ncomplicated: it acts like a closed tube\nat lower frequencies, having only odd\nharmonics, but at higher frequencies\nall harmonics occur as for an open tube.\nFIGURE 12-16 Sound waves from\ntwo loudspeakers interfere.\nInterference in Space\nWe saw in Section 11-11 that when two waves simultaneously pass through the\nsame region of space, they interfere with one another. Interference also occurs\nwith sound waves.\n-1-\nConsider two large loudspeakers, A and B, a distance d apart on the stage of\nan auditorium as shown in Fig. 12-16. Let us assume the two speakers are emit-\nting sound waves of the same single frequency and that they are in phase: that is,\nwhen one speaker is forming a compression, so is the other. (We ignore reflections\nfrom walls, floor, etc.) The curved lines in the diagram represent the crests of\nsound waves from each speaker at one instant in time. We must remember that\nfor a sound wave, a crest is a compression in the air whereas a trough-which\nfalls between two crests-is a rarefaction. A human ear or detector at a point\nsuch as C, which is the same distance from each speaker, will experience a loud\nsound because the interference will be constructive-two crests reach it at one\nmoment, two troughs reach it a moment later. On the other hand, at a point\nsuch as D in the diagram, little if any sound will be heard because destructive\ninterference occurs-compressions of one wave meet rarefactions of the other\nand vice versa (see Fig. 11-38 and the related discussion on water waves in\nSection 11-11).\nD\nA\nd\nC\nB\nl\nSECTION 12-6 Interference of Sound Waves; Beats 341\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': "A\nd\nC\n(a)\nB\nA\nD\nd\nE\n(b)\nB\nFIGURE 12-17 Sound waves of a\nsingle frequency from loudspeakers\nA and B (see Fig. 12-16)\nconstructively interfere at C and\ndestructively interfere at D. [Shown\nhere are graphical representations,\nnot the actual longitudinal sound\nwaves.]\nAn analysis of this situation is perhaps clearer if we graphically represent\nthe waveforms as in Fig. 12-17. In Fig. 12-17a it can be seen that at point C,\nconstructive interference occurs because both waves simultaneously have crests or\nsimultaneously have troughs when they arrive at C. In Fig. 12-17b we see that, to\nreach point D, the wave from speaker B must travel a greater distance than the wave\nfrom A. Thus the wave from B lags behind that from A. In this diagram, point E is\nchosen so that the distance ED is equal to AD. Thus we see that if the distance BE\nis equal to precisely one-half the wavelength of the sound, the two waves will be\nexactly out of phase when they reach D, and destructive interference occurs.\nThis then is the criterion for determining at what points destructive interference\noccurs: destructive interference occurs at any point whose distance from one\nspeaker is one-half wavelength greater than its distance from the other speaker.\nNotice that if this extra distance (BE in Fig. 12-17b) is equal to a whole wave-\nlength (or 2, 3, ... wavelengths), then the two waves will be in phase and\nconstructive interference occurs. If the distance BE equals 2, 12, 22, ... wave-\nlengths, destructive interference occurs.\nIt is important to realize that a person sitting at point D in Fig. 12-16 or\n12-17 hears nothing at all (or nearly so), yet sound is coming from both speakers.\nIndeed, if one of the speakers is turned off, the sound from the other speaker will\nbe clearly heard.\nIf a loudspeaker emits a whole range of frequencies, only specific wavelengths\nwill destructively interfere completely at a given point.\nEXAMPLE 12-13\nLoudspeakers' interference. Two loudspeakers are 1.00 m\napart. A person stands 4.00 m from one speaker. How far should this person be\nfrom the second speaker to detect destructive interference when the speakers\nemit an 1150-Hz sound? Assume the temperature is 20°C.\nAPPROACH To sense destructive interference, the person should be one-half\nwavelength closer to or farther from one speaker than from the other-that is,\nat a distance = 4.00 m + \\/2. We can determine À because we know f and v.\nSOLUTION The speed of sound at 20℃ is 343 m/s, so the wavelength of this\nsound is (Eq. 11-12)\n1 = 2\n343 m/s\n= 0.30 m.\n=\n1150 Hz\nFor destructive interference to occur, the person must be one-half wavelength\nfarther from one loudspeaker than from the other, or 0.15 m.

The sound level at a given position alternately rises and\nfalls in time, because the two waves are sometimes in phase and sometimes out of\nphase due to their different wavelengths. The regularly spaced intensity changes\nare called beats.\n342 CHAPTER 12 Sound\n", 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'fA=50 Hz fB = 60 Hz\nt\nt=0\nsum\nt=0.05 s\nt=0.10 s\nt=0.15 s\nFIGURE 12-18 Beats occur as\na result of the superposition\nof two sound waves of\nslightly different frequency.\nt\nbeat period (0.10 s).\nTo see how beats arise, consider two equal-amplitude sound waves of frequency\nfA = 50 Hz and fB = 60 Hz, respectively. In 1.00 s, the first source makes 50 vibra-\ntions whereas the second makes 60. We now examine the waves at one point in\nspace equidistant from the two sources. The waveforms for each wave as a function\nof time, at a fixed position, are shown on the top graph of Fig. 12-18; the red line\nrepresents the 50-Hz wave, and the blue line represents the 60-Hz wave. The\nlower graph in Fig. 12-18 shows the sum of the two waves as a function of time. At\ntime t = 0 the two waves are shown to be in phase and interfere constructively.\nBecause the two waves vibrate at different rates, at time t = 0.05 s they are\ncompletely out of phase and interfere destructively. At t = 0.10 s, they are again\nin phase and the resultant amplitude again is large. Thus the resultant amplitude\nis large every 0.10 s and drops drastically in between. This rising and falling of the\nintensity is what is heard as beats. In this case the beats are 0.10 s apart. That is,\nthe beat frequency is ten per second, or 10 Hz. This result, that the beat frequency\nequals the difference in frequency of the two waves, is valid in general.\nThe phenomenon of beats can occur with any kind of wave and is a very\nsensitive method for comparing frequencies. For example, to tune a piano, a piano\ntuner listens for beats produced between his standard tuning fork and the frequency\nof a particular string on the piano, and knows it is in tune when the beats disappear.\nThe members of an orchestra tune up by listening for beats between their instru-\nments and the frequency of a standard tone (usually A above middle C at 440 Hz)\nproduced by a piano or an oboe. Humans hear the individual beats if they are only\na few per second. For higher beat frequencies, they run together and up to about\n20 Hz or so you hear an intensity modulation (a wavering between loud and soft);\nabove 20 Hz you hear a separate low tone (audible if the tones are strong enough).\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nTuning a piano\nEXAMPLE 12-14\nBeats. A tuning fork produces a steady 400-Hz tone. When\nthis tuning fork is struck and held near a vibrating guitar string, twenty beats\nare counted in five seconds. What are the possible frequencies produced by the\nguitar string?\nAPPROACH For beats to occur, the string must vibrate at a frequency different\nfrom 400 Hz by whatever the beat frequency is.\nSOLUTION The beat frequency is\nfbeat = 20 vibrations/5 s = 4 Hz.\nThis is the difference of the frequencies of the two waves. Because one wave is\nknown to be 400 Hz, the other must be either 404 Hz or 396 Hz.\n*Beats will be heard even if the amplitudes are not equal, as long as the difference in amplitude is\nnot great.\nSECTION 12-6 Interference of Sound Waves; Beats 343\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 12-20 Determination of\nthe frequency shift in the Doppler\neffect (see text).

Or you may have noticed the change in pitch of a\nblaring horn on a fast-moving car as it passes by you. The pitch of the engine\nnoise of a race car changes as the car passes an observer. When a source of sound\nis moving toward an observer, the pitch the observer hears is higher than when\nthe source is at rest; and when the source is traveling away from the observer, the\npitch is lower. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler effectt and occurs for\nall types of waves. Let us now see why it occurs, and calculate the difference\nbetween the perceived and source sound frequencies when there is relative motion\nbetween source and observer.\n(a) At rest\n(b) Fire truck moving\nFIGURE 12-19 (a) Both observers on the sidewalk hear the same\nfrequency from the fire truck at rest. (b) Doppler effect: observer\ntoward whom the fire truck moves hears a higher-frequency sound,\nand observer behind the fire truck hears a lower-frequency sound.\nConsider the siren of a fire truck at rest, which is emitting sound of a partic-\nular frequency in all directions as shown in Fig. 12-19a. The sound waves are\nmoving at the speed of sound in air, Usnd, which is independent of the velocity of\nthe source or observer. If our source, the fire truck, is moving, the siren emits sound\nat the same frequency as it does at rest. But the sound wavefronts it emits forward,\nin front of it, are closer together than when the fire truck is at rest, as shown in\nFig. 12-19b. This is because the fire truck, as it moves, is partly "catching up" to the\npreviously emitted wavefronts, and emits each crest closer to the previous one. Thus an\nobserver on the sidewalk in front of the truck will detect more wave crests passing\nper second, so the frequency heard is higher. The wavefronts emitted behind the\ntruck, on the other hand, are farther apart than when the truck is at rest because\nthe truck is speeding away from them. Each new wavefront emitted is farther from\nthe preceding one than when the truck is at rest. Hence, fewer wave crests per second\npass by an observer behind the moving truck (Fig. 12-19b) and the perceived\npitch is lower.\nWe can calculate the frequency shift by making use of Fig. 12-20. We assume\nthe air (or other medium) is at rest in our reference frame. We consider first the sta-\ntionary observer off to the right in Fig. 12-19. In Fig. 12-20a, the source of the sound\nis shown as a red dot, and is at rest. Two successive wave crests are shown, the\nsecond of which has just been emitted and is still near the source. The distance\nbetween these crests is À, the wavelength. If the frequency of the source is f,\nthen the time between emissions of wave crests is\n1\n<\n.\nIn Fig. 12-20b, the source is moving with a velocity Usource toward the observer.\n+After J. C.

Light and other types\nof electromagnetic waves (such as for radar) exhibit the Doppler effect: although\nthe formulas for the frequency shift are not identical to Eqs. 12-2 and 12-3,\nthe effect is similar (see Chapter 33). One important application is for\nweather forecasting using radar. The time delay between the emission of a radar\npulse and its reception after being reflected off raindrops gives the position of\nprecipitation. Measuring the Doppler shift in frequency (as in Example 12-16)\ntells how fast the storm is moving and in which direction. "Radar guns" used by police\nwork similarly, measuring a car\'s speed by the Doppler shift of electromagnetic waves.\nAnother important application is to astronomy, where the velocities of galaxies\ncan be estimated from the Doppler shift. Light from distant galaxies is shifted\ntoward lower frequencies, indicating that the galaxies are moving away from us.\nThis is called the redshift since red has the lowest frequency of visible light. The\ngreater the frequency shift, the greater the velocity of recession. It is found that\nthe farther the galaxies are from us, the faster they move away.

Such a speed is often given as a Macht number, which is\ndefined as the ratio of the speed of the object to the speed of sound in the sur-\nrounding medium. For example, a plane traveling 600 m/s high in the atmosphere,\nwhere the speed of sound is only 300 m/s, has a speed of Mach 2.\nShock wave\nθ\nShock wave\n(a) \\obj=0\n(b) Vobj < Usnd\n(c) Vobj = Usnd\nFIGURE 12-23 Sound waves emitted by an object (a) at rest or (b, c, and d) moving.\n(b) If the object\'s velocity is less than the velocity of sound, the Doppler effect occurs.\n(c) At Vobj = Usnd, the waves pile up in front, forming a "sound barrier."

But if a source of sound moves faster than the speed of\nsound, a more dramatic effect known as a shock wave occurs. In this case, the\nsource is actually "outrunning" the waves it produces. As shown in Fig. 12-23c,\nwhen the source is traveling at the speed of sound, the wave fronts it emits in the\nforward direction "pile up" directly in front of it. When the object moves faster, at\na supersonic speed, the wave fronts pile up on one another along the sides, as shown\nin Fig. 12-23d. The different wave crests overlap one another and form a single\nvery large crest which is the shock wave. Behind this very large crest there is\nusually a very large trough. A shock wave is essentially the result of constructive\ninterference of a large number of wave fronts. A shock wave in air is analogous\nto the bow wave of a boat traveling faster than the speed of the water waves it\nproduces, Fig. 12-24.\n+After the Austrian physicist Ernst Mach (1838-1916).\n348 CHAPTER 12 Sound\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 22, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Tail shock wave\nFront shock wave\nA\nB\nC\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 12-25 (a) The (double) sonic boom has already been heard by person A on the left.\nThe front shock wave is just being heard by person B in the center. And both will shortly be heard\nby person C on the right. (b) Special photo of supersonic aircraft showing shock waves produced\nin the air. (Several closely spaced shock waves are produced by different parts of the aircraft.)\nWhen an airplane travels at supersonic speeds, greater than the speed of sound\nin the air, the noise it makes and its disturbance of the air form into a shock wave con-\ntaining a tremendous amount of sound energy. When the shock wave passes a listener,\nit is heard as a loud sonic boom. A sonic boom lasts only a fraction of a second, but the\nenergy it contains is sometimes sufficient to break windows and cause other damage.\nActually, a sonic boom is made up of two or more booms since major shock waves\ncan form at the front and the rear of the aircraft (Fig. 12-25), as well as at the wings\nand other parts. Bow waves of a boat are also multiple, as can be seen in Fig. 12-24a.\nWhen an aircraft accelerates toward the speed of sound, it encounters a barrier\nof sound waves in front of it (see Fig. 12-23c). To exceed the speed of sound, the\naircraft needs extra thrust to pass through this sound barrier. This is called\n"breaking the sound barrier." Once a supersonic speed is attained, this barrier no\nlonger impedes the motion. It is sometimes erroneously thought that a sonic boom\nis produced only at the moment an aircraft is breaking through the sound barrier.\nActually, a shock wave follows the aircraft at all times it is traveling at supersonic\nspeeds. A series of observers on the ground will each hear a loud "boom" as the\nshock wave passes, Fig. 12-25. The shock wave consists of a cone whose apex is at\nthe aircraft. The angle of this cone, 0 (see Fig. 12-23d), is given by\nsin 0 = Usnd ,\nVobj\n(12-5)\nwhere Vobj is the velocity of the object (the aircraft) and Usnd is the velocity of\nsound in the medium (air for an airplane).\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nSonic boom\n*\n12-9 Applications: Sonar, Ultrasound,\nand Medical Imaging\n*\nSonar\nThe reflection of sound is used in many applications to determine distance. The\nsonar* or pulse-echo technique is used to locate underwater objects. A transmitter\nsends out a sound pulse through the water, and a detector receives its reflection,\nor echo, a short time later. This time interval is carefully measured, and from it\nthe distance to the reflecting object can be determined since the speed of sound\nin water is known. The depth of the sea and the location of reefs, sunken ships, sub-\nmarines, or schools of fish can be determined in this way. The interior structure of\nthe Earth is studied in a similar way by detecting reflections of waves traveling\nthrough the Earth whose source was a deliberate explosion (called "soundings").\nAn analysis of waves reflected from various structures and boundaries within the\nEarth reveals characteristic patterns that are also useful in the exploration for oil\nand minerals. (Radar used at airports to track aircraft involves a similar pulse-echo\ntechnique except that it uses electromagnetic (EM) waves, which, like visible light,\ntravel with a speed of 3 × 108 m/s.)\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nSonar: depth finding, Earth\nsoundings\n*Sonar stands for "sound navigation ranging."\n*SECTION 12-9 349\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 23, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 12-26 Ultrasound image\nof a human fetus within the uterus.\nSonar generally makes use of ultrasonic frequencies: that is, sound waves whose\nfrequencies are above 20 kHz, beyond the range of human detection. For sonar,\nthe frequencies are typically in the range 20 kHz to 100 kHz. One reason for using\nultrasound waves, other than the fact that they are inaudible, is that for shorter\nwavelengths there is less diffraction (Section 11-14) so the beam spreads less and\nsmaller objects can be detected.\n* Ultrasound Medical Imaging\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nUltrasound medical imaging\nThe diagnostic use of ultrasound in medicine, in the form of images (sometimes\ncalled sonograms), is an important and interesting application of physical princi-\nples. A pulse-echo technique is used, much like sonar, except that the frequencies\nused are in the range of 1 to 10 MHz (1 MHz = 106 Hz). A high-frequency sound\npulse is directed into the body, and its reflections from boundaries or interfaces\nbetween organs and other structures and lesions in the body are then detected.\nTumors and other abnormal growths, or pockets of fluid, can be distinguished;\nthe action of heart valves and the development of a fetus (Fig. 12-26) can be exam-\nined; and information about various organs of the body, such as the brain, heart,\nliver, and kidneys, can be obtained. Although ultrasound does not replace X-rays, for\ncertain kinds of diagnosis it is more helpful. Some kinds of tissue or fluid are not\ndetected in X-ray photographs, but ultrasound waves are reflected from their bound-\naries. "Real-time" ultrasound images are like a movie of a section of the interior\nof the body.\nThe pulse-echo technique for medical imaging works as follows. A brief\npulse of ultrasound is emitted by a transducer that transforms an electrical\npulse into a sound-wave pulse. Part of the pulse is reflected as echoes at each\ninterface in the body, and most of the pulse (usually) continues on, Fig. 12-27a.\nTransducer\nPulse\nVertebra\nFIGURE 12-27 (a) Ultrasound pulse\nEchoes\nEchoes\npasses through the abdomen,\nAbdominal\nwall\nreflecting from surfaces in its path.\n(a)\n(b) Reflected pulses plotted as a\nfunction of time when received by\ntransducer.

For example, if the distance from the transducer to the\nvertebra is 25 cm, the pulse travels a round-trip distance of 2 × 25 cm = 0.50 m.\nThe speed of sound in human tissue is about 1540 m/s (close to that of sea water),\nso the time taken is\n(0.50 m)\nt = == =\n(1540 m/s)\n= 320 us.\nThe strength of a reflected pulse depends mainly on the difference in density\nof the two materials on either side of the interface and can be displayed as a pulse\nor as a dot (Figs. 12-27b and c).

At 20℃,\nit is about 343 m/s.\nThe pitch of a sound is determined by the frequency; the\nhigher the frequency, the higher the pitch.\nThe audible range of frequencies for humans is roughly\n20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (1 Hz = 1 cycle per second).\nThe loudness or intensity of a sound is related to the\namplitude squared of the wave. Because the human ear can detect\nsound intensities from 10-12 W/m2 to over 1 W/m2, sound\nlevels are specified on a logarithmic scale. The sound level B,\nspecified in decibels, is defined in terms of intensity I as\nB (in dB) = 10 log\nI\n1.\n(12-1)\nwhere the reference intensity I0 is usually taken to be\n10-12 W/m2.\nMusical instruments are simple sources of sound in which\nstanding waves are produced.\nThe strings of a stringed instrument may vibrate as a\nwhole with nodes only at the ends; the frequency at which this\nstanding wave occurs is called the fundamental. The funda-\nmental frequency corresponds to a wavelength equal to twice\nthe length of the string, À1 = 20. The string can also vibrate at\nhigher frequencies, called overtones or harmonics, in which\nthere are one or more additional nodes. The frequency of each\nharmonic is a whole-number multiple of the fundamental.\nIn wind instruments, standing waves are set up in the col-\numn of air within the tube.\nThe vibrating air in an open tube (open at both ends) has\ndisplacement antinodes at both ends. The fundamental\nfrequency corresponds to a wavelength equal to twice the\ntube length: À1 = 20. The harmonics have frequencies that are\n1, 2, 3, 4, ··· times the fundamental frequency, just as for\nstrings.\nFor a closed tube (closed at one end), the fundamental\ncorresponds to a wavelength four times the length of the tube:\nÀ1 = 4l. Only the odd harmonics are present, equal to\n1, 3, 5, 7, ··· times the fundamental frequency.\nSound waves from different sources can interfere with\neach other. If two sounds are at slightly different frequencies,\nbeats can be heard at a frequency equal to the difference in fre-\nquency of the two sources.\nThe Doppler effect refers to the change in pitch of a sound\ndue to the motion either of the source or of the observer. If source\nand observer are approaching each other, the perceived pitch is\nhigher. If they are moving apart, the perceived pitch is lower.\n[*Shock waves and a sonic boom occur when an object\nmoves at a supersonic speed-faster than the speed of sound.\nUltrasonic-frequency (higher than 20 kHz) sound waves are used\nin many applications, including sonar and medical imaging.]\nSummary 351\n', 'chapter_title': '12-1 Characteristics of Sound'}, {'page_number': 25, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Questions\n1.

When it emerges and you\ndo see it, its sound is suddenly "brighter"-you hear more of\nthe high-frequency noise. Explain. [Hint: See Section 11-14\non diffraction.]\n11. Standing waves can be said to be due to "interference in\nspace," whereas beats can be said to be due to "interfer-\nence in time." Explain.\n12. In Fig. 12-16, if the frequency of the speakers is lowered,\nwould the points D and C (where destructive and con-\nstructive interference occur) move farther apart or closer\ntogether? Explain.\n13. Traditional methods of protecting the hearing of people who\nwork in areas with very high noise levels have consisted\nmainly of efforts to block or reduce noise levels. With a\nrelatively new technology, headphones are worn that do\nnot block the ambient noise. Instead, a device is used which\ndetects the noise, inverts it electronically, then feeds it to the\nheadphones in addition to the ambient noise. How could\nadding more noise reduce the sound levels reaching the ears?\n14. Consider the two waves shown in Fig. 12-31. Each wave can\nbe thought of as a superposition of two sound waves with\nslightly different frequencies, as in Fig. 12-18.

A fish finder uses a sonar device that sends 20,000-Hz\nsound pulses downward from the bottom of the boat, and\nthen detects echoes.

A single mosquito 5.0 m from a person makes a sound\nclose to the threshold of human hearing (0 dB). What will\nbe the sound level of 200 such mosquitoes?\n66. What is the resultant sound level when an 81-dB sound and\nan 87-dB sound are heard simultaneously?\n67. The sound level 8.25 m from a loudspeaker, placed in the\nopen, is 115 dB. What is the acoustic power output (W) of\nthe speaker, assuming it radiates equally in all directions?\n68. A stereo amplifier is rated at 225 W output at 1000 Hz.\nThe power output drops by 12 dB at 15 kHz. What is the\npower output in watts at 15 kHz?\n69. Workers around jet aircraft typically wear protective devices\nover their ears.

Manufacturers typically offer a particular guitar string in a\nchoice of diameters so that players can tune their instruments\nwith a preferred string tension. For example, a nylon high-E\nstring is available in a low- and high-tension model with diam-\neter 0.699 mm and 0.724 mm, respectively. Assuming the\ndensity p of nylon is the same for each model, compare (as a\nratio) the tension in a tuned high- and low-tension string.\n72. A tuning fork is set into vibration above a vertical open\ntube filled with water (Fig. 12-40). The water level is allowed\nto drop slowly. As it does so, the air in the tube above the water\nlevel is heard to resonate with the\ntuning fork when the distance from\nthe tube opening to the water level\nis 0.125 m and again at 0.395 m.\n0.125 m\nWhat is the frequency of the\ntuning fork?\n0.395 m\nFIGURE 12-40\nProblem 72.\n73.

The "alpenhorn" (Fig. 12-42) was once used to send signals\nfrom one Alpine village to another. Since lower frequency\nsounds are less susceptible to intensity loss, long horns\nwere used to create deep sounds. When played as a musical\ninstrument, the alpenhorn must be blown in such a way\nthat only one of the overtones is resonating. The most\npopular alpenhorn is about 3.4 m long, and it is called the\nF# (or Gb) horn. What is the fundamental frequency\nof this horn, and which overtone is close to F#? (See\nTable 12-3.)

The intensity at the threshold of hearing for the human ear\nat a frequency of about 1000 Hz is Io = 1.0 × 10-12 W/m2,\nfor which B, the sound level, is 0 dB. The threshold of pain\nat the same frequency is about 120 dB, or I = 1.0 W/m2,\ncorresponding to an increase of intensity by a factor of 1012.\nBy what factor does the displacement amplitude, A, vary?\n84. A Doppler flow meter uses ultrasound waves to measure\nblood-flow speeds. Suppose the device emits sound at\n3.5 MHz, and the speed of sound in human tissue is about\n1540 m/s.
