In this Chapter, we will discuss some more common instru-\nments, most of which use lenses, including the camera, telescope, microscope,\nand the human eye. To describe their operation, we will use ray diagrams as we\ndid in Chapter 23. However, we will see that understanding some aspects of their\noperation will require the wave nature of light.\n25-1 Cameras: Film and Digital\nThe basic elements of a camera are a lens, a light-tight box, a shutter to let light\npass through the lens only briefly, and in a digital camera an electronic sensor or\nin a traditional camera a piece of film (Fig. 25-1). When the shutter is opened for\na brief "exposure," light from external objects in the field of view is focused by\nthe lens as an image on the sensor or film.\nYou can see the image yourself if you remove the back of a conventional\ncamera, keeping the shutter open, and view through a piece of tissue paper (on\nwhich an image can form) placed where the film should be.\nOf the many optical devices we\ndiscuss in this Chapter, the\nmagnifying glass is the simplest.\nHere it is magnifying part of\npage 722 of this Chapter, which\ndescribes how the magnifying glass\nworks according to the ray model.\nIn this Chapter we examine film\nand digital cameras, the human\neye, eyeglasses, telescopes, and\nmicroscopes as well as image\nresolution, X-rays, and CT scans.\nA\nPT\nE\nCH\n25\nR\nCONTENTS\n25-1 Cameras: Film and Digital\n25-2 The Human Eye;\nCorrective Lenses\n25-3 Magnifying Glass\n25-4 Telescopes\n25-5 Compound Microscope\n25-6 Aberrations of Lenses\nand Mirrors\n25-7 Limits of Resolution;\nCircular Apertures\n25-8 Resolution of Telescopes and\nMicroscopes; the À Limit\n25-9 Resolution of the Human Eye\nand Useful Magnification\n*25-10 Specialty Microscopes\nand Contrast\n25-11 X-Rays and X-Ray Diffraction\n*25-12 X-Ray Imaging and Computed\nTomography (CT Scan)\nFIGURE 25-1 A simple camera.\nViewfinder\nLens\nD = lens\n1\nopening\nIris diaphragm\nor "stop"\nShutter\nSensor\nor film\n713\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'PHYSICS APPLIED\nCameras, film and digital\nColor\npixel\nElectrodes\nFIGURE 25-2 Portion of a typical\nBayer array sensor.

The film is then developed by chemicals dissolved\nin water, which causes the most changed areas (brightest light) to turn opaque,\nso the image is recorded on the film.+ We might call film "chemical photography"\nas compared to digital, which is electronic.\nDigital Cameras, Electronic Sensors (CCD, CMOS)\nIn a digital camera, the film is replaced by a semiconductor sensor. Two types are\ncommon: CCD (charge-coupled device) and CMOS (complementary metal oxide\nsemiconductor). A CCD sensor is made up of millions of tiny semiconductor pixels\n("picture elements")-see Fig. 24-49. A 12-MP (12-megapixel) sensor might contain\nabout 4000 pixels horizontally by 3000 pixels vertically over an area of perhaps\n16 × 12 mm, and preferably larger such as 36 × 24 mm like 35-mm film. Light\nreaching any pixel liberates electrons within the semiconductor* which are stored\nas charge in that pixel\'s capacitance. The more intense the light, the more charge\naccumulates during the brief exposure time. After exposure, the charge on each\npixel has to be "read" (measured) and stored. A reader circuit first reads the\ncharge on the pixel capacitance right next to it. Immediately after, the charge on\neach pixel is electronically transferred to its adjacent pixel, towards the reader\nwhich reads each pixel charge in sequence, one-by-one. Hence the name\n"charge-coupled device." All this information (the brightness of each pixel) goes to\na central processor that stores it and allows re-formation of the image later onto\nthe camera\'s screen, a computer screen, or a printer. After all the pixel charge\ninformation is transferred to memory (Section 21-8), a new picture can be taken.\nA CMOS sensor also uses a silicon semiconductor, and incorporates tran-\nsistor electronics within each pixel, allowing parallel readout, somewhat like the\nsimilar MOSFET array that was shown in Fig. 21-29.\nSensor sizes are typically in the ratio 4:3 or 3:2. A larger sensor is better\nbecause it can hold more pixels, and/or each pixel can be larger and hold more\ncharge (free electrons) to provide a wider range of brightness, better color accuracy,\nand better sensitivity in low-light conditions.\nIn the most common array of pixels, referred to as a Bayer mosaic, color is\nachieved by red, green, and blue filters over alternating pixels as shown in\nFig. 25-2, similar to what a color LCD or CRT screen does (Sections 17-11 and\n24-11). The sensor type shown in Fig. 25-2 contains twice as many green pixels as\nred or blue (because green seems to have a stronger influence on the human\neye\'s sensation of sharpness). The computer-analyzed color at many pixels is\noften an average with nearest-neighbor colors to reduce memory size\n(= compression, see page 489).\nEach different color of pixel in a Bayer array is counted as a separate pixel.\nIn contrast, in an LCD screen (Sections 17-11 and 24-11), a group of three\nsubpixels is counted as one pixel, a more conservative count.\nAn alternative technology, called "Foveon," uses a semiconductor layer sys-\ntem. Different wavelengths of light penetrate silicon to different depths, as shown in\nFig. 25-3: blue wavelengths are absorbed in the top layer, allowing green and red\nlight to pass through. Longer wavelengths (green) are absorbed in the second\nlayer, and the bottom layer detects the longest wavelengths (red). All three colors\nare detected by each "tri-pixel" site, resulting in better color resolution and fewer\nartifacts.\nDigital Artifacts\nDigital cameras can produce image artifacts (artificial effects in the image not\npresent in the original) resulting from the electronic sensing of the image. One\nexample using the Bayer mosaic of pixels (Fig. 25-2) is described in Fig. 25-4.\n*This is called a negative, because the black areas correspond to bright objects and vice versa. The\nsame process occurs during printing to produce a black-and-white "positive" picture from the\nnegative. Color film has three emulsion layers (or dyes) corresponding to the three primary colors.\n*Specifically, photons of light knock electrons in the valence band up to the conduction band. This\nmaterial on semiconductors is covered in Chapter 29.\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Camera Adjustments\nThere are three main adjustments on good-quality cameras: shutter speed, f-stop,\nand focusing. Although most cameras today make these adjustments automati-\ncally, it is valuable to understand these adjustments to use a camera effectively.\nFor special or top-quality work, a manual camera is indispensable (Fig. 25-5).\nExposure time or shutter speed This refers to how quickly the digital sensor\ncan make an accurate reading of the images, or how long the shutter of a camera\nis open and the film or sensor is exposed. It could vary from a second or more\n("time exposures") to 1000 s or faster. To avoid blurring from camera movement,\nexposure times shorter than 100 s are normally needed. If the object is moving,\neven shorter exposure times are needed to "stop" the action (1000 S or less).\nIf the exposure time is not fast enough, the image will be blurred by camera\nshake. Blurring in low light conditions is more of a problem with cell-phone\ncameras whose inexpensive sensors need to have the shutter open longer to\ncollect enough light. Digital still cameras or cell phones that take short videos\nmust have a fast enough "sampling" time and fast "clearing" (of the charge) so\nas to take pictures at least 15 frames per second; preferable is 24 fps (like film)\nor 30, 60, or 120 fps like TV refresh rates (25, 50, or 100 in areas like Europe\nwhere 50 Hz is the normal line voltage frequency).\nf-stop The amount of light reaching the sensor or film depends on the area of\nthe lens opening as well as shutter speed, and must be carefully controlled to\navoid underexposure (too little light so the picture is dark and only the brightest\nobjects show up) or overexposure (too much light, so that bright objects have a\nlack of contrast and "washed-out" appearance). A high quality camera con-\ntrols the exposure with a "stop" or iris diaphragm, whose opening is of variable\ndiameter, placed behind the lens (Fig. 25-1). The lens opening is controlled\n(automatically or manually) to compensate for bright or dark lighting conditions,\nthe sensitivity of the sensor or film,t and for different shutter speeds. The size of\nthe opening is specified by the f-stop or f-number, defined as\nf-stop = 6.\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens and D is the diameter of the lens opening\n(see Fig. 25-1). For example, when a 50-mm-focal-length lens has an opening\nD = 25 mm, then f/D = 50 mm/25 mm = 2, so we say it is set at f/2. When\nthis lens is set at f /5.6, the opening is only 9 mm (50/9 = 5.6). For faster shutter\nspeeds, or low light conditions, a wider lens opening must be used to get a proper\nexposure, which corresponds to a smaller f-stop number. The smaller the f-stop\nnumber, the larger the opening and the more light passes through the lens to the\nsensor or film. The smallest f-number of a lens (largest opening) is referred to as\nthe speed of the lens. The best lenses may have a speed of f/2.0, or even faster.\nThe advantage of a fast lens is that it allows pictures to be taken under poor\nlighting conditions. Good quality lenses consist of several elements to reduce the\ndefects present in simple thin lenses (Section 25-6). Standard f-stops are\n1.0, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8, 4.0, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, and 32\n(Fig. 25-5). Each of these stops corresponds to a diameter reduction by a factor of\nV2 ~ 1.4. Because the amount of light reaching the film is proportional to the\narea of the opening, and therefore proportional to the diameter squared, each\nstandard f-stop corresponds to a factor of 2 change in light intensity reaching\nthe film.\n*Different films have different sensitivities to light, referred to as the "film speed" and specified as an\n"ISO (or ASA) number." A "faster" film is more sensitive and needs less light to produce a good\nimage, but is grainier which you see when the image is enlarged. Digital cameras may have a "gain" or\n"ISO" adjustment for sensitivity. A typical everyday ISO might be 200 or so. Adjusting a CCD to be\n"faster" (high ISO like 3200) for low light conditions results in "noise," resulting in graininess just as\nin film cameras.\nPAUSA\n16 11 8 36 4 28 2 14\nFIGURE 25-5 On this camera, the\nf-stops and the focusing ring are on\nthe camera lens.

The image distance is\nsmallest for objects at infinity (the symbol oo is used for infinity) and is equal to\nthe focal length, as we saw in Section 23-7. For closer objects, the image distance\nis greater than the focal length, as can be seen from the lens equation,\n1/f=1/do + 1/di (Eq. 23-8). To focus on nearby objects, the lens must there-\nfore be moved away from the sensor or film, and this is usually done on a manual\ncamera by turning a ring on the lens.\nIf the lens is focused on a nearby object, a sharp image of it will be formed,\nbut the image of distant objects may be blurry (Fig. 25-6). The rays from a point\non the distant object will be out of focus-instead of a point, they will form a\ncircle on the sensor or film as shown (exaggerated) in Fig. 25-7. The distant object\nwill thus produce an image consisting of overlapping circles and will be blurred.\nThese circles are called circles of confusion. To have near and distant objects sharp\nin the same photo, you (or the camera) can try setting the lens focus at an inter-\nmediate position. For a given distance setting, there is a range of distances over\nwhich the circles of confusion will be small enough that the images will be\nreasonably sharp. This is called the depth of field. For a sensor or film width of\n36 mm (including 35-mm film cameras), the depth of field is usually based on\na maximum circle of confusion diameter of 0.030 mm, even 0.02 mm or 0.01 mm\nfor critical work or very large photographs. The depth of field varies with the\nlens opening. If the lens opening is smaller, only rays through the central part\nof the lens are accepted, and these form smaller circles of confusion for a given\nobject distance. Hence, at smaller lens openings, a greater range of object dis-\ntances will fit within the circle of confusion criterion, so the depth of field is greater.\nSmaller lens openings, however, result in reduced resolution due to diffraction\n(discussed later in this Chapter). Best resolution is typically found around f/5.6\nor f/8.\nRays from\nnearby object\n(in focus)\nRays from\ndistant object\n"Circle of confusion"\nfor distant object\n(greatly exaggerated)\n-\nFIGURE 25-7 When the lens is positioned to focus on a nearby object,\npoints on a distant object produce circles and are therefore blurred.\n(The effect is shown greatly exaggerated.)\nEXAMPLE 25-1\nCamera focus. How far must a 50.0-mm-focal-length\ncamera lens be moved from its infinity setting to sharply focus an object 3.00 m\naway?\nAPPROACH For an object at infinity, the image is at the focal point, by definition\n(Section 23-7). For an object distance of 3.00 m, we use the thin lens equation,\nEq. 23-8, to find the image distance (distance of lens to film or sensor).\nSOLUTION When focused at infinity, the lens is 50.0 mm from the film.

To improve the depth of\nfield, you "stop down" your camera lens by two f-stops from f /4 to f /8. What\nshould you do to the shutter speed to maintain the same exposure?\nRESPONSE The amount of light admitted by the lens is proportional to the\narea of the lens opening. Reducing the lens opening by two f-stops reduces the\ndiameter by a factor of 2, and the area by a factor of 4. To maintain the same\nexposure, the shutter must be open four times as long. If the shutter speed had\nbeen 500 s, you would have to increase the exposure time to 125 S.\n* Picture Sharpness\nThe sharpness of a picture depends not only on accurate focusing and short exposure\ntimes, but also on the graininess of the film, or number of pixels on a digital sensor.\nFine-grained films and tiny pixels are "slower," meaning they require longer expo-\nsures for a given light level. All pixels are rarely used because digital cameras have\naveraging (or "compression") programs, such as JPEG, which reduce memory size\nby averaging over pixels where little contrast is detected. But some detail is inevi-\ntably lost. For example, a small blue lake may seem uniform, and coding 600 pixels\nas identical takes less memory than specifying all 600. Any slight variation of the\nwater surface is lost. Full "RAW" data uses more memory. Film records everything\n(down to its grain size), as does RAW if your camera offers it. The processor also\naverages over pixels in low light conditions, resulting in a less sharp photo.\nThe quality of the lens strongly affects the image quality, and we discuss lens\nresolution and diffraction effects in Sections 25-6 and 25-7. The sharpness, or\nresolution, of a lens is often given as so many lines per millimeter, measured by\nphotographing a standard set of parallel black lines on a white background\n(sometimes said as "line pairs/mm") on fine-grain film or high quality sensor, or\nas so many dots per inch (dpi). The minimum spacing of distinguishable lines or\ndots gives the resolution. A lens that can give 50 lines/mm is reasonable,\n100 lines/mm is very good (= 100 dots/mm ~ 2500 dpi). Electronic sensors also\nhave a resolution and it is sometimes given as line pairs across the full sensor width.\nA "full" Bayer pixel (upper left in Fig. 25-2) is 4 regular pixels: for example,\nto make a white dot as part of a white line (between two black lines when deter-\nmining lens resolution), all 4 Bayer pixels (RGGB) would have to be bright. For\na Foveon, all three colors of one pixel need to be bright to produce a white dot.+\nEXAMPLE 25-3\nPixels and resolution. A digital camera offers a maximum\nresolution of 4000 × 3000 pixels on a 32 mm × 24 mm sensor. How sharp should\nthe lens be to make use of this sensor resolution in RAW?\nAPPROACH We find the number of pixels per millimeter and require the lens\nto be at least that good.\nSOLUTION We can either take the image height (3000 pixels in 24 mm) or the\nwidth (4000 pixels in 32 mm):\n3000 pixels\n24 mm\n= 125 pixels/mm.\nWe would like the lens to match this resolution of 125 lines or dots per mm,\nwhich would be a quite good lens. If the lens is not this good, fewer pixels and\nless memory could be used.\nNOTE Increasing lens resolution is a tougher problem today than is squeezing\nmore pixels on a CCD or CMOS sensor. The sensor for high quality cameras\nmust also be physically larger for better image accuracy and greater light\nsensitivity in low light conditions.\n*Consider a 4000 × 3000 pixel array. For a Foveon, each "full pixel" (Fig. 25-3) has all 3 colors, each\nof which can be counted as a pixel, so it may be considered as 4000 × 3000 × 3 = 36 MP. For a\nBayer sensor, Fig. 25-2, 4000 × 3000 is 12 MP (6 MP of green, 3 MP each of red and blue). There are\nmore green pixels because they are most important in our eyes\' ability to note resolution. So the\ndistance between green pixels is a rough guide to the sharpness of a Bayer. To match a 4000 × 3000\nFoveon (36 MP, or 12 MP of tri-pixel sites), a Bayer would need to have about 24 MP (because it\nwould then have 12 MP of green). This "equivalence" is only a rough approximation.\nSECTION 25-1 717\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'PHYSICS APPLIED\nWhen is a photo sharp?\nLens\nPrism\nMirror\nFIGURE 25-8 Single-lens reflex\n(SLR) camera, showing how the\nimage is viewed through the lens\nwith the help of a movable mirror\nand prism.\nEXAMPLE 25-4\nBlown-up photograph. A photograph looks sharp\nat normal viewing distances if the dots or lines are resolved to perhaps\n10 dots/mm. Would an 8 × 10-inch enlargement of a photo taken by the camera\nin Example 25-3 seem sharp?\nAPPROACH We assume the image is 4000 × 3000 pixels on a 32 × 24-mm\nsensor as in Example 25-3, or 125 pixels/mm. We make an enlarged photo\n8 × 10 in. = 20 cm × 25 cm.\nSOLUTION The short side of the sensor is 24 mm = 2.4 cm long, and that side\nof the photograph is 8 inches or 20 cm. Thus the size is increased by a factor of\n20 cm/2.4 cm ~ 8X (or 25 cm/3.2 cm ~ 8x). To fill the 8 × 10-in. paper, we\nassume the enlargement is 8X. The pixels are thus enlarged 8x. So the pixel\ncount of 125/mm on the sensor becomes 125/8 = 15 per mm on the print.\nHence an 8 × 10-inch print would be a sharp photograph. We could go 50%\nlarger-11 × 14 or maybe even 12 × 18 inches.\nIn order to make very large photographic prints, large-format cameras are used\nsuch as 6 cm X 6 cm (24inch square)-either film or sensor-and even 4 × 5 inch\nand 8 × 10 inch (using sheet film or glass plates).\nEXERCISE B The criterion of 0.030 mm as the diameter of a circle of confusion as\nacceptable sharpness is how many dots per mm on the sensor?\nTelephotos and Wide-angles\nCamera lenses are categorized into normal, telephoto, and wide angle, according\nto focal length and film size. A normal lens covers the sensor or film with a field\nof view that corresponds approximately to that of normal vision. A "normal" lens\nfor 35-mm film has a focal length of 50 mm. The best digital cameras aim for a\nsensor of the same size+ (24 mm × 36 mm). (If the sensor is smaller, digital cam-\neras sometimes specify focal lengths to correspond with classic 35-mm cameras.)\nTelephoto lenses act like telescopes to magnify images. They have longer focal\nlengths than a normal lens: as we saw in Section 23-8 (Eq. 23-9), the height of the\nimage for a given object distance is proportional to the image distance, and the\nimage distance will be greater for a lens with longer focal length. For distant\nobjects, the image height is very nearly proportional to the focal length. Thus\na 200-mm telephoto lens for use with a 35-mm camera gives a 4X magnification\nover the normal 50-mm lens. A wide-angle lens has a shorter focal length than\nnormal: a wider field of view is included, and objects appear smaller. A zoom lens\nis one whose focal length can be changed (by changing the distance between the thin\nlenses that make up the compound lens) so that you seem to zoom up to, or away\nfrom, the subject as you change the focal length.\nDigital cameras may have an optical zoom meaning the lens can change focal\nlength and maintain resolution. But an "electronic" or digital zoom just enlarges\nthe dots (pixels) with loss of sharpness.\nDifferent types of viewing systems are used in cameras. In some cameras,\nyou view through a small window just above the lens as in Fig. 25-1. In a\nsingle-lens reflex camera (SLR), you actually view through the lens with the use\nof prisms and mirrors (Fig. 25-8). A mirror hangs at a 45° angle behind the lens\nand flips up out of the way just before the shutter opens. SLRs have the advan-\ntage that you can see almost exactly what you will get. Digital cameras use an LCD\ndisplay, and it too can show what you will get on the photo if it is carefully\ndesigned.\n+A "35-mm camera" uses film that is physically 35 mm wide; that 35 mm is not to be confused with a\nfocal length. 35-mm film has sprocket holes, so only 24 mm of its height is used for the photo; the width\nis usually 36 mm for stills. Thus one frame is 36 mm × 24 mm. Movie frames on 35-mm film are\n24 mm × 18 mm.\n718 CHAPTER 25 Optical Instruments\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': '25-2 The Human Eye;\nCorrective Lenses\nThe human eye resembles a camera in its basic structure (Fig. 25-9), but is far\nmore sophisticated. The interior of the eye is filled with a transparent gel-like\nsubstance called the vitreous humor with index of refraction n = 1.337. Light\nenters this enclosed volume through the cornea and lens. Between the cornea and\nlens is a watery fluid, the aqueous humor (aqua is "water" in Latin) with n = 1.336.\nA diaphragm, called the iris (the colored part of your eye), adjusts automatically\nto control the amount of light entering the eye, similar to a camera. The hole in the\niris through which light passes (the pupil) is black because no light is reflected\nfrom it (it\'s a hole), and very little light is reflected back out from the interior of\nthe eye. The retina, which plays the role of the film or sensor in a camera, is on the\ncurved rear surface of the eye. The retina consists of a complex array of nerves\nand receptors known as rods and cones which act to change light energy into elec-\ntrical signals that travel along the nerves. The reconstruction of the image from all\nthese tiny receptors is done mainly in the brain, although some analysis may also\nbe done in the complex interconnected nerve network at the retina itself. At the\ncenter of the retina is a small area called the fovea, about 0.25 mm in diameter,\nwhere the cones are very closely packed and the sharpest image and best color\ndiscrimination are found.\nUnlike a camera, the eye contains no shutter. The equivalent operation is\ncarried out by the nervous system, which analyzes the signals to form images at\nthe rate of about 30 per second. This can be compared to motion picture or tele-\nvision cameras, which operate by taking a series of still pictures at a rate of 24\n(movies) and 60 or 30 (U.S. television) per second. Their rapid projection on the\nscreen gives the appearance of motion.\nThe lens of the eye (n = 1.386 to 1.406) does little of the bending of the light\nrays. Most of the refraction is done at the front surface of the cornea (n = 1.376)\nat its interface with air (n = 1.0). The lens acts as a fine adjustment for focusing\nat different distances. This is accomplished by the ciliary muscles (Fig. 25-9),\nwhich change the curvature of the lens so that its focal length is changed. To\nfocus on a distant object, the ciliary muscles of the eye are relaxed and the lens is\nthin, as shown in Fig. 25-10a, and parallel rays focus at the focal point (on the\nretina). To focus on a nearby object, the muscles contract, causing the center of\nthe lens to thicken, Fig. 25-10b, thus shortening the focal length so that images of\nnearby objects can be focused on the retina, behind the new focal point. This\nfocusing adjustment is called accommodation.\nThe closest distance at which the eye can focus clearly is called the near point\nof the eye. For young adults it is typically 25 cm, although younger children can\noften focus on objects as close as 10 cm. As people grow older, the ability to\naccommodate is reduced and the near point increases. A given person\'s far point\nis the farthest distance at which an object can be seen clearly. For some purposes\nit is useful to speak of a normal eye (a sort of average over the population),\ndefined as an eye having a near point of 25 cm and a far point of infinity. To check\nyour own near point, place this book close to your eye and slowly move it away\nuntil the type is sharp.\nThe "normal" eye is sort of an ideal. Many people have eyes that do not\naccommodate within the "normal" range of 25 cm to infinity, or have some other\ndefect. Two common defects are nearsightedness and farsightedness. Both can\nbe corrected to a large extent with lenses-either eyeglasses or contact lenses.\nIn nearsightedness, or myopia, the human eye can focus only on nearby\nobjects. The far point is not infinity but some shorter distance, so distant objects\nare not seen clearly. Nearsightedness is usually caused by an eyeball that is too\nlong, although sometimes it is the curvature of the cornea that is too great.\nIn either case, images of distant objects are focused in front of the retina.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nThe eye\nCiliary\nmuscles\nRetina\nIris\nAqueous\nhumor\nFovea\nVitreous\nhumor\nPupil\nCornea\nOptic\nnerve\nLens\nCiliary\nmuscles\nFIGURE 25-9 Diagram of a human\neye.\nFIGURE 25-10 Accommodation\nby a normal eye: (a) lens relaxed,\nfocused at infinity; (b) lens thickened,\nfocused on a nearby object.\nFocal point of lens and cornea\nObject\nat oo\n(a)\nFocal point of lens and cornea\nObject\n(b)\nSECTION 25-2 The Human Eye; Corrective Lenses 719\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 25-11 Correcting eye defects\nwith lenses.

This defect is caused by an\neyeball that is too short or (less often) by a cornea that is not sufficiently curved. It\nis corrected by a converging lens, Figs. 25-11c and d. Similar to hyperopia is\npresbyopia, which is the lessening ability of the eye to accommodate as a person\nages, and the near point moves out. Converging lenses also compensate for this.\nAstigmatism is usually caused by an out-of-round cornea or lens so that point\nobjects are focused as short lines, which blurs the image. It is as if the cornea were\nspherical with a cylindrical section superimposed. As shown in Fig. 25-12, a cylin-\ndrical lens focuses a point into a line parallel to its axis. An astigmatic eye may\nfocus rays in one plane, such as the vertical plane, at a shorter distance than it does\nfor rays in a horizontal plane. Astigmatism is corrected with the use of a compen-\nsating cylindrical lens. Lenses for eyes that are nearsighted or farsighted as well\nas astigmatic are ground with superimposed spherical and cylindrical surfaces, so\nthat the radius of curvature of the correcting lens is different in different planes.\nEXAMPLE 25-5\nFarsighted eye. A farsighted eye has a near point of\n100 cm. Reading glasses must have what lens power so that a newspaper can be\nread at a distance of 25 cm? Assume the lens is very close to the eye.\nAPPROACH When the object is placed 25 cm from the lens (= do), we want the\nimage to be 100 cm away on the same side of the lens (so the eye can focus it),\nand so the image is virtual, as shown in Fig. 25-13, and di = - 100 cm will be\nnegative.

Assume\nthat the lens is 2.0 cm from the eye (typical for eyeglasses).\nAPPROACH For a distant object (do = 00), the lens must put the image at the\nfar point of the eye as shown in Fig. 25-14a, 17 cm in front of the eye. We can\nuse the thin lens equation to find the focal length of the lens, and from this its\nlens power. The new near point (as shown in Fig. 25-14b) can be calculated for\nthe lens by again using the thin lens equation.\nSOLUTION (a) For an object at infinity (do = ), the image must be in front\nof the lens 17 cm from the eye or (17 cm - 2 cm) = 15 cm from the lens; hence\ndi = - 15 cm.

The new near point would be 41 cm. Thus we see that a\ncontact lens and an eyeglass lens will require slightly different powers, or focal\nlengths, for the same eye because of their different placements relative to the eye.\nWe also see that glasses in this case give a better near point than contacts.\nEXERCISE C What power of contact lens is needed for an eye to see distant objects if its\nfar point is 25 cm?\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nContact lenses-different\nfand P\nUnderwater Vision\nWhen your eyes are under water, distant underwater objects look blurry because\nat the water-cornea interface, the difference in indices of refraction is very small:\nn = 1.33 for water, 1.376 for the cornea.

We first discuss the simple magnifier,\nor magnifying glass, which is simply a converging lens (see Chapter-Opening\nPhoto, page 713).\nHow large an object appears, and how much detail we can see on it, depends\non the size of the image it makes on the retina. This, in turn, depends on the\nangle subtended by the object at the eye. For example, a penny held 30 cm from\nthe eye looks twice as tall as one held 60 cm away because the angle it subtends is\ntwice as great (Fig. 25-16). When we want to examine detail on an object, we\nbring it up close to our eyes so that it subtends a greater angle. However, our\neyes can accommodate only up to a point (the near point), and we will assume\na standard distance of N = 25 cm as the near point in what follows.\nA magnifying glass allows us to place the object closer to our eye so that it\ncan be seen. The angle 0 that the object subtends a greater angle.

Then the converging lens produces a virtual image,\nwhich must be at least 25 cm from the eye if the eye is to focus on it. If the eye is\nrelaxed, the image will be at infinity, and in this case the object is exactly at the\nfocal point.

He was the first to examine the heavens with the\ntelescope (Fig. 25-19), and he made world-shaking discoveries, including the\nmoons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, sunspots, the structure of the Moon\'s\nsurface, and that the Milky Way is made up of a huge number of individual stars.\n(a)\n*Galileo built his first telescope in 1609 after having heard of such an instrument existing in Holland.\nThe first telescopes magnified only three to four times, but Galileo soon made a 30-power instrument.\nThe first Dutch telescopes date from about 1604 and probably were copies of an Italian telescope\nbuilt around 1590. Kepler (see Chapter 5) gave a ray description (in 1611) of the Keplerian telescope,\nwhich is named for him because he first described it, although he did not build it.\n(b)\nSECTION 25-4 Telescopes 723\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'fo\n- fe fe-\nFIGURE 25-20 Astronomical\ntelescope (refracting).

The objective lens is\n102 cm (40 inches) in diameter, and\nthe telescope tube is about 19 m\nlong. Example 25-8.\n12\nSeveral types of astronomical telescope exist. The common refracting type,\nsometimes called Keplerian, contains two converging lenses located at opposite\nends of a long tube, as illustrated in Fig. 25-20. The lens closest to the object is\ncalled the objective lens (focal length f.) and forms a real image I1 of the distant\nobject in the plane of its focal point Fo (or near it if the object is not at infinity).\nThe second lens, called the eyepiece (focal length fe), acts as a magnifier. That is,\nthe eyepiece magnifies the image I1 formed by the objective lens to produce\na second, greatly magnified image, I2, which is virtual and inverted. If the view-\ning eye is relaxed, the eyepiece is adjusted so the image I2 is at infinity. Then the\nreal image I1 is at the focal point Fe of the eyepiece, and the distance between the\nlenses is fo + fe for an object at infinity.\nTo find the total angular magnification of this telescope, we note that the\nangle an object subtends as viewed by the unaided eye is just the angle 0 sub-\ntended at the telescope objective. From Fig. 25-20 we can see that 0 ~ h/f.,\nwhere h is the height of the image I1 and we assume 0 is small so that tan 0 ~ 0.\nNote, too, that the thickest of the three rays drawn in Fig. 25-20 is parallel to the\naxis before it strikes the eyepiece and therefore is refracted through the eyepiece\nfocal point Fe on the far side. Thus, 0\' ~ h/fe and the total magnifying power\n(that is, angular magnification, which is what is always quoted) of this telescope is\nM = \' = (h/fe)\n(h/f 0)\n: fo,\nfe\ntelescope\nmagnification\nd\n(25-3)\nwhere we used Eq. 25-1 and we inserted a minus sign to indicate that the image is\ninverted. To achieve a large magnification, the objective lens should have a long\nfocal length and the eyepiece a short focal length.\nEXAMPLE 25-8\nTelescope magnification. The largest optical refracting\ntelescope in the world is located at the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin,\nFig. 25-21. It is referred to as a "40-inch" telescope, meaning that the diameter of\nthe objective is 40 in., or 102 cm. The objective lens has a focal length of 19 m,\nand the eyepiece has a focal length of 10 cm. (a) Calculate the total magnifying\npower of this telescope.

The distance between the two lenses is thus fo + fe ~ 19 m,\nwhich is essentially the length of the telescope.\n724 CHAPTER 25 Optical Instruments\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXERCISE D A 40X telescope has a 1.2-cm focal length eyepiece. What is the focal\nlength of the objective lens?\nFor an astronomical telescope to produce bright images of faint stars, the\nobjective lens must be large to allow in as much light as possible. Indeed, the diam-\neter of the objective lens (and hence its "light-gathering power") is an important\nparameter for an astronomical telescope, which is why the largest ones are specified\nby giving the objective diameter (such as the 10-meter Keck telescope in Hawaii).\nThe construction and grinding of large lenses is very difficult. Therefore, the\nlargest telescopes are reflecting telescopes which use a curved mirror as the objec-\ntive, Fig. 25-22. A mirror has only one surface to be ground and can be supported\nalong its entire surface* (a large lens, supported at its edges, would sag under its\nown weight). Often, the eyepiece lens or mirror (see Fig. 25-22) is removed so\nthat the real image formed by the objective mirror can be recorded directly on\nfilm or on an electronic sensor (CCD or CMOS, Section 25-1).\nConcave mirror\n(objective)\nParallel\nrays from\ndistant\nobject\nSecondary\nmirror\nEyepiece\nEyepiece\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFIGURE 25-22 A concave mirror can be used as the objective of an astronomical telescope.

Two designs are shown in Fig. 25-23. The Galilean type, which\nGalileo used for his great astronomical discoveries, has a diverging lens as eye-\npiece which intercepts the converging rays from the objective lens before they reach\na focus, and acts to form a virtual upright image, Fig. 25-23a. This design is still\nused in opera glasses. The tube is reasonably short, but the field of view is small.\nThe second type, shown in Fig. 25-23b, is often called a spyglass and makes use\nof a third convex lens that acts to make the image upright as shown. A spyglass\nmust be quite long. The most practical design today is the prism binocular which\nwas shown in Fig. 23-28. The objective and eyepiece are converging lenses. The\nprisms reflect the rays by total internal reflection and shorten the physical size of\nthe device, and they also act to produce an upright image. One prism reinverts\nthe image in the vertical plane, the other in the horizontal plane.\n+Another advantage of mirrors is that they exhibit no chromatic aberration because the light doesn\'t\npass through them; and they can be ground into a parabolic shape to correct for spherical aberration\n(Section 25-6).

The object is placed just beyond the objective\'s focal point\nas shown in Fig. 25-24a. The image I1 formed by the objective lens is real, quite\nfar from the objective lens, and much enlarged.

The image I1 is magnified by the\neyepiece into a very large virtual image, I2, which is seen by the eye and is\ninverted.

We found,\nfor example, that all rays from each point on an object are brought to a single\npoint as the image point. This result, and others, were based on approximations for\na thin lens, mainly that all rays make small angles with the axis and that we can\nuse sin 0 ~ 0. Because of these approximations, we expect deviations from the\nsimple theory, which are referred to as lens aberrations. There are several types of\naberration; we will briefly discuss each of them separately, but all may be present\nat one time.\nConsider an object at any point (even at infinity) on the axis of a lens with\nspherical surfaces. Rays from this point that pass through the outer regions of the\nlens are brought to a focus at a different point from those that pass through the\ncenter of the lens. This is called spherical aberration, and is shown exaggerated in\nFig. 25-25. Consequently, the image seen on a screen or film will not be a point\nbut a tiny circular patch of light. If the sensor or film is placed at the point C, as\nindicated, the circle will have its smallest diameter, which is referred to as the\ncircle of least confusion. Spherical aberration is present whenever spherical\nsurfaces are used. It can be reduced by using nonspherical (= aspherical) lens\nsurfaces, but grinding such lenses is difficult and expensive. Spherical aberration\ncan be reduced by the use of several lenses in combination, and by using primarily\nthe central part of lenses.\nFor object points off the lens axis, additional aberrations occur. Rays passing\nthrough the different parts of the lens cause spreading of the image that is\nnoncircular. There are two effects: coma (because the image of a point is comet-\nshaped rather than a tiny circle) and off-axis astigmatism.+ Furthermore, the\nimage points for objects off the axis but at the same distance from the lens do not\nfall on a flat plane but on a curved surface-that is, the focal plane is not flat. (We\nexpect this because the points on a flat plane, such as the film in a camera, are not\nequidistant from the lens.) This aberration is known as curvature of field and is\na problem in cameras and other devices where the sensor or film is a flat plane.\nIn the eye, however, the retina is curved, which compensates for this effect.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nLens aberrations\nC\nFIGURE 25-25 Spherical aberration\n(exaggerated). Circle of least confusion\nis at C.\n+Although the effect is the same as for astigmatism in the eye (Section 25-2), the cause is different.\nOff-axis astigmatism is no problem in the eye because objects are clearly seen only at the fovea, on\nthe lens axis.\nSECTION 25-6 Aberrations of Lenses and Mirrors 727\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Another aberration, distortion, is a result of variation of magnification at\ndifferent distances from the lens axis. Thus a straight-line object some distance\nfrom the axis may form a curved image. A square grid of lines may be distorted\nto produce "barrel distortion," or "pincushion distortion," Fig. 25-26. The former\nis common in extreme wide-angle lenses.\nFIGURE 25-26 Distortion: lenses may image\na square grid of perpendicular lines to\nproduce (a) barrel distortion or (b) pincushion\ndistortion.

Different colors are\nfocused at different points.\nWhite\nRed\nBlue\nFIGURE 25-28 Achromatic doublet.\nWhite\nRed\nWhite\nBlue\n*\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nAberration in the human eye\nAxis\n(a)\n(b)\nAll the above aberrations occur for monochromatic light and hence are\nreferred to as monochromatic aberrations. Normal light is not monochromatic,\nand there will also be chromatic aberration. This aberration arises because of\ndispersion-the variation of index of refraction of transparent materials with\nwavelength (Section 24-4). For example, blue light is bent more than red light by\nglass. So if white light is incident on a lens, the different colors are focused at\ndifferent points, Fig. 25-27, and have slightly different magnifications resulting in\ncolored fringes in the image. Chromatic aberration can be eliminated for any two\ncolors (and reduced greatly for all others) by the use of two lenses made of\ndifferent materials with different indices of refraction and dispersion. Normally\none lens is converging and the other diverging, and they are often cemented\ntogether (Fig. 25-28). Such a lens combination is called an achromatic doublet\n(or "color-corrected" lens).\nTo reduce aberrations, high-quality lenses are compound lenses consisting of\nmany simple lenses, referred to as elements. A typical high-quality camera lens\nmay contain six to eight (or more) elements. For simplicity we will usually indi-\ncate lenses in diagrams as if they were simple lenses.\nThe human eye is also subject to aberrations, but they are minimal. Spherical\naberration, for example, is minimized because (1) the cornea is less curved at the\nedges than at the center, and (2) the lens is less dense at the edges than at the center.\nBoth effects cause rays at the outer edges to be bent less strongly, and thus help\nto reduce spherical aberration. Chromatic aberration is partially compensated for\nbecause the lens absorbs the shorter wavelengths appreciably and the retina is less\nsensitive to the blue and violet wavelengths. This is just the region of the spectrum\nwhere dispersion-and thus chromatic aberration-is greatest (Fig. 24-14).\nSpherical mirrors (Section 23-3) also suffer aberrations including spherical\naberration (see Fig. 23-13). Mirrors can be ground in a parabolic shape to correct\nfor aberrations, but they are much harder to make and therefore very expensive.\nSpherical mirrors do not, however, exhibit chromatic aberration because the\nlight does not pass through them (no refraction, no dispersion).\n25-7 Limits of Resolution;\nCircular Apertures\nThe ability of a lens to produce distinct images of two point objects very close\ntogether is called the resolution of the lens. The closer the two images can be and\nstill be seen as distinct (rather than overlapping blobs), the higher the resolution.\nThe resolution of a camera lens, for example, is often specified as so many dots or\nlines per millimeter, as mentioned in Section 25-1.\n728 CHAPTER 25 Optical Instruments\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Two principal factors limit the resolution of a lens. The first is lens aberrations.\nAs we just saw, because of spherical and other aberrations, a point object is not a\npoint on the image but a tiny blob. Careful design of compound lenses can reduce\naberrations significantly, but they cannot be eliminated entirely. The second factor\nthat limits resolution is diffraction, which cannot be corrected for because it is a\nnatural result of the wave nature of light. We discuss it now.\nIn Section 24-5, we saw that because light travels as a wave, light from a point\nsource passing through a slit is spread out into a diffraction pattern (Figs. 24-19\nand 24-21). A lens, because it has edges, acts like a round slit. When a lens forms\nthe image of a point object, the image is actually a tiny diffraction pattern. Thus\nan image would be blurred even if aberrations were absent.\nIn the analysis that follows, we assume that the lens is free of aberrations, so we\ncan concentrate on diffraction effects and how much they limit the resolution of a\nlens. In Fig. 24-21 we saw that the diffraction pattern produced by light passing\nthrough a rectangular slit has a central maximum in which most of the light falls. This\ncentral peak falls to a minimum on either side of its center at an angle 0 given by\nsin 0 = A/D\n(this is Eq. 24-3a), where D is the slit width and À the wavelength of light used. 0 is\nthe angular half-width of the central maximum, and for small angles (in radians)\ncan be written\nA ~ sine = A .\nThere are also low-intensity fringes beyond.\nFor a lens, or any circular hole, the image of a point object will consist of a\ncircular central peak (called the diffraction spot or Airy disk) surrounded by faint\ncircular fringes, as shown in Fig. 25-29a. The central maximum has an angular\nhalf-width given by\n0 = 1.224 ,\nwhere D is the diameter of the circular opening. [This is a theoretical result for a\nperfect circle or lens. For real lenses or circles, the factor is on the order of 1 to 2.]\nThis formula differs from that for a slit (Eq. 24-3) by the factor 1.22. This factor\nappears because the width of a circular hole is not uniform (like a rectangular slit)\nbut varies from its diameter D to zero. A mathematical analysis shows that the\n"average" width is D/1.22. Hence we get the equation above rather than Eq. 24-3.\nThe intensity of light in the diffraction pattern from a point source of light passing\nthrough a circular opening is shown in Fig. 25-30. The image for a non-point source\nis a superposition of such patterns. For most purposes we need consider only the\ncentral spot, since the concentric rings are so much dimmer.\nIf two point objects are very close, the diffraction patterns of their images\nwill overlap as shown in Fig. 25-29b. As the objects are moved closer, a separation\nis reached where you can\'t tell if there are two overlapping images or a single image.\nThe separation at which this happens may be judged differently by different obser-\nvers. However, a generally accepted criterion is that proposed by Lord Rayleigh\n(1842-1919). This Rayleigh criterion states that two images are just resolvable when\nthe center of the diffraction disk of one image is directly over the first minimum in\nthe diffraction pattern of the other. This is shown in Fig. 25-31. Since the first\nminimum is at an angle 0 = 1.22\\/D from the central maximum, Fig. 25-31\nshows that two objects can be considered just resolvable if they are separated by\nat least an angle 0 given by\n0 = 121.\n2 points just resolvable;\ne in radians\n(25-7)\nIn this equation, D is the diameter of the lens, and applies also to a mirror\ndiameter. This is the limit on resolution set by the wave nature of light due to\ndiffraction. A smaller angle means better resolution: you can make out closer\nobjects. We see from Eq. 25-7 that using a shorter wavelength À can reduce 0 and\nthus increase resolution.\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 25-29 Photographs of\nimages (greatly magnified) formed by\na lens, showing the diffraction pattern\nof an image for: (a) a single point\nobject; (b) two point objects whose\nimages are barely resolved.\nIntensity\n1.22/ 0 1.22A\nu\nD\nD\nFIGURE 25-30 Intensity of light\nacross the diffraction pattern of a\ncircular hole.\nFIGURE 25-31 The Rayleigh criterion.\nTwo images are just resolvable when\nthe center of the diffraction peak of\none is directly over the first minimum\nin the diffraction pattern of the other.\nThe two point objects O and O\'\nsubtend an angle 0 at the lens; only\none ray (it passes through the center\nof the lens) is drawn for each object,\nto indicate the center of the\ndiffraction pattern of its image.\nO\ns\nu\nO\'\nu\nSECTION 25-7 Limits of Resolution; Circular Apertures\n729\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': "FIGURE 25-32 Hubble Space\nTelescope, with Earth in the\nbackground.

Radiotelescopes\nare not hindered by atmospheric turbulence, and the resolution found in (b) is\na good estimate.\nFIGURE 25-33 The 300-meter\nradiotelescope in Arecibo, Puerto\nRico, uses radio waves (Fig. 22-8)\ninstead of visible light.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nWhy large-diameter objectives\nFor a microscope, it is more convenient to specify the actual distance, s,\nbetween two points that are just barely resolvable: see Fig. 25-31. Since objects\nare normally placed near the focal point of the microscope objective, the angle\nsubtended by two objects is 0 = s/f, so s = f0. If we combine this with\nEq. 25-7, we obtain the resolving power (RP) of a microscope\nRP = s = f0 =\n50 = 1.2 1 ,\n[microscope] (25-8)\nwhere f is the objective lens' focal length (not frequency) and D its diameter. The\ndistance s is called the resolving power of the lens because it is the minimum\nseparation of two object points that can just be resolved-assuming the highest\nquality lens since this limit is imposed by the wave nature of light. A smaller RP\nmeans better resolution, better detail.\n*Earth-bound telescopes with large-diameter objectives are usually limited not by diffraction but by\nother effects such as turbulence in the atmosphere. The resolution of a high-quality microscope, on\nthe other hand, normally is limited by diffraction; microscope objectives are complex compound\nlenses containing many elements of small diameter (since fis small), thus reducing aberrations.\nSECTION 25-8 Resolution of Telescopes and Microscopes; the \\ Limit 731\n", 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Diffraction sets an ultimate limit on the detail that can be seen on any object.\nIn Eq. 25-8 for the resolving power of a microscope, the focal length of the lens\ncannot practically be made less than (approximately) the radius of the lens (= D/2),\nand even that is very difficult (see the lensmaker's equation, Eq. 23-10). In this\nbest case, Eq. 25-8 gives, with f ~ D/2,\nRP ~ 1.\n(25-9)\nWavelength limits resolution\nThus we can say, to within a factor of 2 or so, that\nit is not possible to resolve detail of objects smaller than the wavelength of\nthe radiation being used.\nThis is an important and useful rule of thumb.\nCompound lenses in microscopes are now designed so well that the actual\nlimit on resolution is often set by diffraction-that is, by the wavelength of the\nlight used. To obtain greater detail, one must use radiation of shorter wavelength.\nThe use of UV radiation can increase the resolution by a factor of perhaps 2. Far\nmore important, however, was the discovery in the early twentieth century that\nelectrons have wave properties (Chapter 27) and that their wavelengths can be\nvery small. The wave nature of electrons is utilized in the electron microscope\n(Section 27-9), which can magnify 100 to 1000 times more than a visible-light\nmicroscope because of the much shorter wavelengths. X-rays, too, have very short\nwavelengths and are often used to study objects in great detail (Section 25-11).\n25-9 Resolution of the Human Eye\nand Useful Magnification\nThe resolution of the human eye is limited by several factors, all of roughly the\nsame order of magnitude. The resolution is best at the fovea, where the cone\nspacing is smallest, about 3 um (= 3000 nm). The diameter of the pupil varies\nfrom about 0.1 cm to about 0.8 cm. So for À = 550 nm (where the eye's sensi-\ntivity is greatest), the diffraction limit is about 0 ~ 1.22\\/D ~ 8 × 10-5 rad to\n6 × 10-4 rad. The eye is about 2 cm long, giving a resolving power (Eq. 25-8) of\ns~ (2 × 10-2m)(8 × 10-5 rad) ~ 2 um at best, to about 10 um at worst (pupil\nsmall). Spherical and chromatic aberration also limit the resolution to about 10 um.\nThe net result is that the eye can just resolve objects whose angular separation is\naround\nbest eye\nresolution\n5 × 10-4 rad.\nd\nThis corresponds to objects separated by 1 cm at a distance of about 20 m.\nThe typical near point of a human eye is about 25 cm. At this distance, the\neye can just resolve objects that are (25 cm)(5 × 10-4 rad) ~ 10-4m = 101\n1 mm\napart.+ Since the best light microscopes can resolve objects no smaller than about\n200 nm at best (Eq. 25-9 for violet light, À = 400 nm), the useful magnification\n[= (resolution by naked eye)/ (resolution by microscope)] is limited to about\n10-4 m\n200 × 10-9m\nL\nmaximum useful\nmicroscope magnification\n500X.\nIn practice, magnifications of about 1000X are often used to minimize eyestrain.\nAny greater magnification would simply make visible the diffraction pattern pro-\nduced by the microscope objective lens.\nEXERCISE F Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 713, and answer it again\nnow.

The difference in brightness\nbetween the image of an object and the image of the surroundings is called contrast.\nAchieving high contrast is an important problem in microscopy and other forms\nof imaging. The problem arises in biology, for example, because cells consist largely\nof water and are almost uniformly transparent to light. We now briefly discuss\ntwo special types of microscope that can increase contrast: the interference and\nphase-contrast microscopes.\nAn interference microscope makes use of the wave properties of light in a\ndirect way to increase contrast in a transparent object. Consider a transparent\nobject-say, a bacterium in water (Fig. 25-34). Coherent light enters uniformly\nfrom the left and is in phase at all points such as a and b. If the object is as trans-\nparent as the water, the beam leaving at d will be as bright as that at c. There will\nbe no contrast and the object will not be seen. However, if the object\'s refractive\nindex is slightly different from that of the surrounding medium, the wavelength\nwithin the object will be altered as shown. Hence light waves at points c and d\nwill differ in phase, if not in amplitude. The interference microscope changes this\ndifference in phase into a difference of amplitude which our eyes can detect. Light\nthat passes through the sample is superimposed onto a reference beam that does\nnot pass through the object, so that they interfere. One way of doing this is shown\nin Fig. 25-35. Light from a source is split into two equal beams by a half-silvered\nmirror, MS1 . One beam passes through the object, and the second (comparison\nbeam) passes through an identical system without the object. The two meet again\nand are superposed by the half-silvered mirror MS2 before entering the eyepiece\nand eye. The path length (and amplitude) of the comparison beam is adjustable so\nthat the background can be dark; that is, full destructive interference occurs. Light\npassing through the object (beam bd in Fig. 25-34) will also interfere with the com-\nparison beam. But because of its different phase, the interference will not be\ncompletely destructive. Thus it will appear brighter than the background. Where the\nobject varies in thickness, the phase difference between beams ac and bd in Fig. 25-34\nwill be different, thus affecting the amount of interference. Hence variation in the\nthickness of the object will appear as variations in brightness in the image.\nA phase-contrast microscope also makes use of interference and differences\nin phase to produce a high-contrast image. Contrast is achieved by a circular\nglass phase plate that has a groove (or a raised portion) in the shape of a ring,\npositioned so undeviated source rays pass through it, but rays deviated by the\nobject do not pass through this ring. Because the rays deviated by the object travel\nthrough a different thickness of glass than the undeviated source rays, the two can\nbe out of phase and can interfere destructively at the object image plane. Thus the\nimage of the object can contrast sharply with the background. Phase-contrast\nmicroscope images tend to have "halos" around them (as a result of diffraction from\nthe phase-plate opening), so care must be taken in the interpretation of images.\n25-11 X-Rays and X-Ray Diffraction\nIn 1895, W. C. Roentgen (1845-1923) discovered that when electrons were accel-\nerated by a high voltage in a vacuum tube and allowed to strike a glass or metal\nsurface inside the tube, fluorescent minerals some distance away would glow, and\nphotographic film would become exposed. Roentgen attributed these effects to\na new type of radiation (different from cathode rays). They were given the name\nX-rays after the algebraic symbol x, meaning an unknown quantity. He soon found\nthat X-rays penetrated through some materials better than through others, and\nwithin a few weeks he presented the first X-ray photograph (of his wife\'s hand).\nThe production of X-rays today is usually done in a tube (Fig. 25-36) similar to\nRoentgen\'s, using voltages of typically 30 kV to 150 kV.\na\nc\nLight\nb\nObject\nd\nH2O\nFIGURE 25-34 Object-say,\na bacterium-in a water solution.\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nInterference microscope\nFIGURE 25-35 Diagram of an\ninterference microscope.\nComparison\nslide\nM1\nMS2\nObjective\nlenses\nEyepiece\nObject\nSource\nMS1\n/M2\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nPhase-contrast microscope\nFIGURE 25-36 X-ray tube.

The diffraction\npattern was detected directly on a\nphotographic plate.\nInvestigations into the nature of X-rays indicated they were not charged par-\nticles (such as electrons) since they could not be deflected by electric or magnetic\nfields. It was suggested that they might be a form of invisible light. However,\nthey showed no diffraction or interference effects using ordinary gratings.\nIndeed, if their wavelengths were much smaller than the typical grating spacing\nof 10-6 m (= 103 nm), no effects would be expected. Around 1912, Max von Laue\n(1879-1960) suggested that if the atoms in a crystal were arranged in a regular\narray (see Fig. 13-2a), such a crystal might serve as a diffraction grating for very\nshort wavelengths on the order of the spacing between atoms, estimated to be\nabout 10-10 m (= 10-1 nm). Experiments soon showed that X-rays scattered\nfrom a crystal did indeed show the peaks and valleys of a diffraction pattern\n(Fig. 25-37). Thus it was shown, in a single blow, that X-rays have a wave nature\nand that atoms are arranged in a regular way in crystals. Today, X-rays are\nrecognized as electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the range of about\n10-2 nm to 10 nm, the range readily produced in an X-ray tube.\n*X-Ray Diffraction\nWe saw in Sections 25-7 and 25-8 that light of shorter wavelength provides\ngreater resolution when we are examining an object microscopically. Since\nX-rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible light, they should in principle\noffer much greater resolution. However, there seems to be no effective material\nto use as lenses for the very short wavelengths of X-rays. Instead, the clever but\ncomplicated technique of X-ray diffraction (or crystallography) has proved very\neffective for examining the microscopic world of atoms and molecules. In\na simple crystal such as NaCl, the atoms are arranged in an orderly cubical\nfashion, Fig. 25-38, with atoms spaced a distance d apart. Suppose that a beam of\nX-rays is incident on the crystal at an angle ø to the surface, and that the two rays\nshown are reflected from two subsequent planes of atoms as shown. The two rays\nwill constructively interfere if the extra distance ray I travels is a whole number\nof wavelengths farther than the distance ray II travels. This extra distance is\n2d sin ø. Therefore, constructive interference will occur when\nmì = 2d sin ¢,\nm = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\n(25-10)\nwhere m can be any integer. (Notice that ø is not the angle with respect to the normal\nto the surface.) This is called the Bragg equation after W. L. Bragg (1890-1971),\nwho derived it and who, together with his father, W. H. Bragg (1862-1942),\ndeveloped the theory and technique of X-ray diffraction by crystals in 1912-1913.\nIf the X-ray wavelength is known and the angle ø is measured, the distance d\nbetween atoms can be obtained. This is the basis for X-ray crystallography.\nI\nII\nFIGURE 25-38 X-ray diffraction by\na crystal.\nf\n1\nd\nf\nd sin ₲\nFIGURE 25-39 X-rays can be\ndiffracted from many possible planes\nwithin a crystal.\nEXERCISE G When X-rays of wavelength 0.10 × 10-9 m are scattered from a sodium\nchloride crystal, a second-order diffraction peak is observed at 21°. What is the spacing\nbetween the planes of atoms for this scattering?\nActual X-ray diffraction patterns are quite complicated. First of all, a crystal\nis a three-dimensional object, and X-rays can be diffracted from different planes\nat different angles within the crystal, as shown in Fig. 25-39. Although the analysis\nis complex, a great deal can be learned from X-ray diffraction about any sub-\nstance that can be put in crystalline form.\n734 CHAPTER 25 Optical Instruments\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 23, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'X-ray diffraction has been very useful in determining the structure of biolog-\nically important molecules, such as the double helix structure of DNA, worked\nout by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. See Fig. 25-40, and for models\nof the double helix, Figs. 16-39a and 16-40. Around 1960, the first detailed\nstructure of a protein molecule, myoglobin, was elucidated with the aid of X-ray\ndiffraction. Soon the structure of an important constituent of blood, hemoglobin,\nwas worked out, and since then the structures of a great many molecules have\nbeen determined with the help of X-rays.\n25-12 X-Ray Imaging and\nComputed Tomography (CT Scan)\n*\nNormal X-Ray Image\nFor a conventional medical or dental X-ray photograph, the X-rays emerging from\nthe tube (Fig. 25-36) pass through the body and are detected on photographic film,\na digital sensor, or a fluorescent screen, Fig. 25-41. The rays travel in very nearly\nstraight lines through the body with minimal deviation since at X-ray wavelengths\nthere is little diffraction or refraction. There is absorption (and scattering), how-\never; and the difference in absorption by different structures in the body is what\ngives rise to the image produced by the transmitted rays. The less the absorption,\nthe greater the transmission and the darker the film. The image is, in a sense,\na "shadow" of what the rays have passed through. The X-ray image is not pro-\nduced by focusing rays with lenses as for the instruments discussed earlier in\nthis Chapter.\n* Tomography Images (CT)\nIn conventional X-ray images, a body\'s thickness is projected onto film or a\nsensor; structures overlap and in many cases are difficult to distinguish. In the 1970s,\na revolutionary X-ray technique was developed called computed tomography (CT),\nwhich produces an image of a slice through the body. (The word tomography\ncomes from the Greek: tomos = slice, graph = picture.) Structures and lesions\npreviously impossible to visualize can now be seen with remarkable clarity. The\nprinciple behind CT is shown in Fig. 25-42: a thin collimated (parallel) beam of\nX-rays passes through the body to a detector that measures the transmitted\nintensity. Measurements are made at a large number of points as the source and\ndetector are moved past the body together. The apparatus is then rotated slightly\nabout the body axis and again scanned; this is repeated at (perhaps) 1° intervals\nfor 180°. The intensity of the transmitted beam for the many points of each scan,\nand for each angle, is sent to a computer that reconstructs the image of the slice.\nNote that the imaged slice is perpendicular to the long axis of the body. For this\nreason, CT is sometimes called computerized axial tomography (CAT), although\nthe abbreviation CAT, as in CAT scan, can also be read as computer-assisted\ntomography.\nVideo monitor\nComputer\nCollimator\nDetector\nCollimator\nX-ray\nsource\nFIGURE 25-40 X-ray diffraction photo\nof DNA molecules taken by Rosalind\nFranklin in the early 1950s.

The source and detectors\nare then rotated about the patient, and an image requires only a few seconds.\nEven faster, and therefore useful for heart scans, are fixed source machines\nwherein an electron beam is directed (by magnetic fields) to tungsten targets\nsurrounding the patient, creating the X-rays.

We can think of the slice to be imaged as being\ndivided into many tiny picture elements (or pixels), which could be squares (as in\nFig. 24-49). For CT, the width of each pixel is chosen according to the width of\nthe detectors and/or the width of the X-ray beams, and this determines the reso-\nlution of the image, which might be 1 mm. An X-ray detector measures the\nintensity of the transmitted beam. Subtracting this value from the intensity of the\nbeam at the source yields the total absorption (called a "projection") along that\nbeam line. Complicated mathematical techniques are used to analyze all the\nabsorption projections for the huge number of beam scans measured (see the\nnext Subsection), obtaining the absorption at each pixel and assigning each a\n"grayness value" according to how much radiation was absorbed. The image is\nmade up of tiny spots (pixels) of varying shades of gray. Often the amount of\nabsorption is color-coded. The colors in the resulting false-color image have\nnothing to do, however, with the actual color of the object. The actual images are\nmonochromatic (various shades of gray, depending on the absorption). Only\nvisible light has color; X-rays do not.\nFigure 25-44 illustrates what actual CT images look like. It is generally agreed\nthat CT scanning has revolutionized some areas of medicine by providing much\nless invasive, and/or more accurate, diagnosis.\nComputed tomography can also be applied to ultrasound imaging\n(Section 12-9) and to emissions from radioisotopes and nuclear magnetic\nresonance (Sections 31-8 and 31-9).\n*Tomographic Image Reconstruction\nHow can the "grayness" of each pixel be determined even though all we can\nmeasure is the total absorption along each beam line in the slice? It can be done\nonly by using the many beam scans made at a great many different angles. Sup-\npose the image is to be an array of 100 × 100 elements for a total of 104 pixels.\nIf we have 100 detectors and measure the absorption projections at 100 different\nangles, then we get 104 pieces of information. From this information, an image can\nbe reconstructed, but not precisely. If more angles are measured, the reconstruction\nof the image can be done more accurately.\n(b)\n736 CHAPTER 25 Optical Instruments\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 25, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'To suggest how mathematical reconstruction is done, we consider a very simple\ncase using the iterative technique ("to iterate" is from the Latin "to repeat").\nSuppose our sample slice is divided into the simple 2 × 2 pixels as shown in\nFig. 25-45. The number inside each pixel represents the amount of absorption by\nthe material in that area (say, in tenths of a percent): that is, 4 represents twice\nas much absorption as 2. But we cannot directly measure these values-they are\nthe unknowns we want to solve for. All we can measure are the projections-the\ntotal absorption along each beam line-and these are shown in Fig. 25-45 out-\nside the yellow squares as the sum of the absorptions for the pixels along each\nline at four different angles. These projections (given at the tip of each arrow) are\nwhat we can measure, and we now want to work back from them to see how close\nwe can get to the true absorption value for each pixel. We start our analysis with\neach pixel being assigned a zero value, Fig. 25-46a. In the iterative technique, we\nuse the projections to estimate the absorption value in each square, and repeat\nfor each angle. The angle 1 projections are 7 and 13 (Fig. 25-45). We divide each of\nthese equally between their two squares: each square in the left column of Fig. 25-46a\ngets 32 (half of 7), and each square in the right column gets 62 (half of 13).\n7\n13\n4\nAngle 1\n2\n4\n> 6\nAngle\n2\n5\n9\n14\nAngle\n4\n9\nAngle\n3\n11\nFIGURE 25-45 A simple 2 × 2\nimage showing true absorption\nvalues (inside the squares) and\nmeasured projections.\n7\n13\n+\nAngle 1\nFIGURE 25-46 Reconstructing the image using projections in an iterative procedure.\n0\n0\n0\n0\n32\n2\n3 4\n62\n6\nAngle 2\n(measured)\n->14\n14\n4%\n2\n8-\n2\n4\n5\n9\n(a)\n(b)\nAngle\n4\n9\nAngle\n(c)\n(d)\n3\n11\nNext we use the projections at angle 2. We calculate the difference between the\nmeasured projections at angle 2 (6 and 14) and the projections based on the pre-\nvious estimate (top row: 32 + 62 = 10; same for bottom row). Then we distribute\nthis difference equally to the squares in that row. For the top row, we have\n31 +\n6 - 10\n2\n= 14\nand\n6} +\n2\n6 - 10 = 4;\nand for the bottom row,\n14 - 10\n= 52\nand\n62 +\n14 - 10\n34 + 1\n2\n2\n= 8%.\nThese values are inserted as shown in Fig. 25-46c.

To obtain these numbers exactly, we used six pieces of\ninformation (two each at angles 1 and 2, one each at angles 3 and 4). For the\nmuch larger number of pixels used for actual images, exact values are generally\nnot attained. Many iterations may be needed, and the calculation is considered\nsufficiently precise when the difference between calculated and measured\nprojections is sufficiently small. The above example illustrates the "convergence"\nof the process: the first iteration (b to c in Fig. 25-46) changed the values by 2,\nthe last iteration (c to d) by only 2 .\n*SECTION 25-12 X-Ray Imaging and Computed Tomography (CT Scan) 737\n', 'chapter_title': 'Optical Instruments'}, {'page_number': 26, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Summary\nA camera lens forms an image on film, or on an electronic\nsensor (CCD or CMOS) in a digital camera. Light is allowed in\nbriefly through a shutter. The image is focused by moving the\nlens relative to the film or sensor, and the f-stop (or lens\nopening) must be adjusted for the brightness of the scene and\nthe chosen shutter speed. The f-stop is defined as the ratio of\nthe focal length to the diameter of the lens opening.\nThe human eye also adjusts for the available light-by\nopening and closing the iris. It focuses not by moving the lens,\nbut by adjusting the shape of the lens to vary its focal length.\nThe image is formed on the retina, which contains an array of\nreceptors known as rods and cones.\nDiverging eyeglass or contact lenses are used to correct\nthe defect of a nearsighted eye, which cannot focus well on dis-\ntant objects. Converging lenses are used to correct for defects\nin which the eye cannot focus on close objects.\nA simple magnifier is a converging lens that forms a virtual\nimage of an object placed at (or within) the focal point.

Compound\nlenses, consisting of several elements, can largely correct for\naberrations.\nThe wave nature of light also limits the sharpness, or\nresolution, of images. Because of diffraction, it is not possible\nto discern details smaller than the wavelength of the radiation\nbeing used.
