But the electric force plays an\neven deeper role in our lives. According to atomic theory, electric forces\nbetween atoms and molecules hold them together to form liquids and solids, and\nelectric forces are also involved in the metabolic processes that occur within our\nbodies. Many of the forces we have dealt with so far, such as elastic forces, the\nnormal force, and friction and other contact forces (pushes and pulls), are now\nconsidered to result from electric forces acting at the atomic level. Gravity, on\nthe other hand, is a separate force.+\n+As we discussed in Section 5-9, physicists in the twentieth century came to recognize four different\nfundamental forces in nature: (1) gravitational force, (2) electromagnetic force (we will see later that\nelectric and magnetic forces are intimately related), (3) strong nuclear force, and (4) weak nuclear\nforce. The last two forces operate at the level of the nucleus of an atom. Recent theory has combined\nthe electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces so they are now considered to have a common origin\nknown as the electroweak force.

We will discuss the development\nof ideas about electricity, including practical devices, as well as its relation to\nmagnetism, in the next seven Chapters.\n16-1 Static Electricity; Electric Charge\nand Its Conservation\nThe word electricity comes from the Greek word elektron, which means "amber."\nAmber is petrified tree resin, and the ancients knew that if you rub a piece of\namber with a cloth, the amber attracts small pieces of leaves or dust. A piece of\nhard rubber, a glass rod, or a plastic ruler rubbed with a cloth will also display\nthis "amber effect," or static electricity as we call it today. You can readily pick up\nsmall pieces of paper with a plastic comb or ruler that you have just vigorously\nrubbed with even a paper towel. See the photo on the previous page and Fig. 16-1.\nYou have probably experienced static electricity when combing your hair or when\ntaking a synthetic blouse or shirt from a clothes dryer. And you may have felt a\nshock when you touched a metal doorknob after sliding across a car seat or walking\nacross a synthetic carpet. In each case, an object becomes "charged" as a result of\nrubbing, and is said to possess a net electric charge.\nIs all electric charge the same, or is there more than one type? In fact, there\nare two types of electric charge, as the following simple experiments show. A plastic\nruler suspended by a thread is vigorously rubbed with a cloth to charge it. When\na second plastic ruler, which has been charged in the same way, is brought close\nto the first, it is found that one ruler repels the other. This is shown in Fig. 16-2a.\nSimilarly, if a rubbed glass rod is brought close to a second charged glass rod,\nagain a repulsive force is seen to act, Fig. 16-2b. However, if the charged glass\nrod is brought close to the charged plastic ruler, it is found that they attract each\nother, Fig. 16-2c. The charge on the glass must therefore be different from that on\nthe plastic. Indeed, it is found experimentally that all charged objects fall into one\nof two categories. Either they are attracted to the plastic and repelled by the glass;\nor they are repelled by the plastic and attracted to the glass. Thus there seem to be\ntwo, and only two, types of electric charge. Each type of charge repels the same type\nbut attracts the opposite type. That is: unlike charges attract; like charges repel.\nThe two types of electric charge were referred to as positive and negative by\nthe American statesman, philosopher, and scientist Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790).\nThe choice of which name went with which type of charge was arbitrary. Franklin\'s\nchoice set the charge on the rubbed glass rod to be positive charge, so the charge\non a rubbed plastic ruler (or amber) is called negative charge. We still follow this\nconvention today.\nFranklin argued that whenever a certain amount of charge is produced on one\nobject, an equal amount of the opposite type of charge is produced on another\nobject. The positive and negative are to be treated algebraically, so during any\nprocess, the net change in the amount of charge produced is zero. For example,\nwhen a plastic ruler is rubbed with a paper towel, the plastic acquires a negative\ncharge and the towel acquires an equal amount of positive charge. The charges\nare separated, but the sum of the two is zero.\nThis is an example of a law that is now well established: the law of conservation\nof electric charge, which states that\nthe net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero;\nor, said another way,\nno net electric charge can be created or destroyed.\nIf one object (or a region of space) acquires a positive charge, then an equal\namount of negative charge will be found in neighboring areas or objects. No\nviolations have ever been found, and the law of conservation of electric charge is\nas firmly established as those for energy and momentum.\n444 CHAPTER 16\n', 'chapter_title': 'Electric Charge and Electric Field'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': '16-2 Electric Charge in the Atom\nOnly within the past century has it become clear that an understanding of electric-\nity originates inside the atom itself. In later Chapters we will discuss atomic structure\nand the ideas that led to our present view of the atom in more detail. But it will\nhelp our understanding of electricity if we discuss it briefly now.\nA simplified model of an atom shows it as having a tiny but massive, positively\ncharged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons (Fig. 16-3).\nThe nucleus contains protons, which are positively charged, and neutrons, which\nhave no net electric charge. All protons and all electrons have exactly the same\nmagnitude of electric charge; but their signs are opposite. Hence neutral atoms,\nhaving no net charge, contain equal numbers of protons and electrons. Sometimes\nan atom may lose one or more of its electrons, or may gain extra electrons, in which\ncase it will have a net positive or negative charge and is called an ion.\nIn solid materials the nuclei tend to remain close to fixed positions, whereas\nsome of the electrons may move quite freely. When an object is neutral, it contains\nequal amounts of positive and negative charge. The charging of a solid object by\nrubbing can be explained by the transfer of electrons from one object to the other.\nWhen a plastic ruler becomes negatively charged by rubbing with a paper towel,\nelectrons are transferred from the towel to the plastic, leaving the towel with a\npositive charge equal in magnitude to the negative charge acquired by the plastic.\nIn liquids and gases, nuclei or ions can move as well as electrons.\nNormally when objects are charged by rubbing, they hold their charge only\nfor a limited time and eventually return to the neutral state. Where does the\ncharge go? Usually the excess charge "leaks off" onto water molecules in the air.\nThis is because water molecules are polar-that is, even though they are neutral,\ntheir charge is not distributed uniformly, Fig. 16-4. Thus the extra electrons on,\nsay, a charged plastic ruler can "leak off" into the air because they are attracted\nto the positive end of water molecules. A positively charged object, on the other\nhand, can be neutralized by transfer of loosely held electrons from water mole-\ncules in the air. On dry days, static electricity is much more noticeable since the\nair contains fewer water molecules to allow leakage of charge. On humid or rainy\ndays, it is difficult to make any object hold a net charge for long.\n16-3 Insulators and Conductors\nSuppose we have two metal spheres, one highly charged and the other electrically\nneutral (Fig. 16-5a). If we now place a metal object, such as a nail, so that it touches\nboth spheres (Fig. 16-5b), the previously uncharged sphere quickly becomes\ncharged. If, instead, we had connected the two spheres by a wooden rod or a piece\nof rubber (Fig. 16-5c), the uncharged ball would not become noticeably charged.\nMaterials like the iron nail are said to be conductors of electricity, whereas wood\nand rubber are nonconductors or insulators.\nMetals are generally good conductors, whereas most other materials are\ninsulators (although even insulators conduct electricity very slightly). Nearly all\nnatural materials fall into one or the other of these two distinct categories.\nHowever, a few materials (notably silicon and germanium) fall into an intermediate\ncategory known as semiconductors.\nFrom the atomic point of view, the electrons in an insulating material are\nbound very tightly to the nuclei. In a good metal conductor, on the other hand,\nsome of the electrons are bound very loosely and can move about freely within the\nmetal (although they cannot leave the metal easily) and are often referred to as\nfree electrons or conduction electrons. When a positively charged object is brought\nclose to or touches a conductor, the free electrons in the conductor are attracted\nby this positively charged object and move quickly toward it. If a negatively\ncharged object is brought close to the conductor, the free electrons in the con-\nductor move swiftly away from it. In a semiconductor, there are many fewer free\nelectrons, and in an insulator, almost none.\n++\nFIGURE 16-3 Simple model of the\natom.\nFIGURE 16-4 Diagram of a water\nmolecule.

If the two touch, the free electrons in the neutral one are attracted\nto the positively charged object and some of those electrons will pass over to it,\nFig. 16-6. Since object B, originally neutral, is now missing some of its negative\nelectrons, it will have a net positive charge. This process is called charging by\nconduction, or "by contact," and the two objects end up with the same sign of\ncharge.\nNow suppose a positively charged object is brought close to a neutral metal\nrod, but does not touch it. Although the free electrons of the metal rod do not leave\nthe rod, they still move within the metal toward the external positive charge,\nleaving a positive charge at the opposite end of the rod (Fig. 16-7b). A charge is said\nto have been induced at the two ends of the metal rod. No net charge has been created\nin the rod: charges have merely been separated. The net charge on the metal rod\nis still zero. However, if the metal is separated into two pieces, we would have two\ncharged objects: one charged positively and one charged negatively. This is\ncharging by induction.\n(a)\nNeutral metal rod\n(a)\n++\n-\n(b)\n.+\n–\n–\n++\n+\n–\n(b)\nMetal rod still neutral, but\nwith a separation of charge\nFIGURE 16-7 Charging by induction:\nif the rod in (b) is cut into two parts,\neach part will have a net charge.\n++ ++ +\n(c)\nFIGURE 16-8 Inducing a\ncharge on an object connected\nto ground.\nAnother way to induce a net charge on a metal object is to first connect it\nwith a conducting wire to the ground (or a conducting pipe leading into the\nground) as shown in Fig. 16-8a (the symbol = means connected to "ground").\nThe object is then said to be grounded or "earthed." The Earth, because it is so\nlarge and can conduct, easily accepts or gives up electrons; hence it acts like a\nreservoir for charge. If a charged object-say negative this time-is brought up\nclose to the metal object, free electrons in the metal are repelled and many of\nthem move down the wire into the Earth, Fig. 16-8b. This leaves the metal posi-\ntively charged. If the wire is now cut, the metal object will have a positive induced\ncharge on it (Fig. 16-8c). If the wire is cut after the negative object is moved\naway, the electrons would all have moved from the ground back into the metal\nobject and it would be neutral again.\nCharge separation can also be done in nonconductors. If you bring a positively\ncharged object close to a neutral nonconductor as shown in Fig. 16-9, almost no\nelectrons can move about freely within the nonconductor. But they can move\nslightly within their own atoms and molecules. Each oval in Fig. 16-9 represents a\nmolecule (not to scale); the negatively charged electrons, attracted to the external\npositive charge, tend to move in its direction within their molecules. Because the\nnegative charges in the nonconductor are nearer to the external positive charge,\nthe nonconductor as a whole is attracted to the external positive charge (see the\nChapter-Opening Photo, page 443).\nAn electroscope is a device that can be used for detecting charge. As shown in\nFig. 16-10, inside a case are two movable metal leaves, often made of gold foil,\nconnected to a metal knob on the outside. (Sometimes only one leaf is movable.)\n446 CHAPTER 16 Electric Charge and Electric Field\n', 'chapter_title': 'Electric Charge and Electric Field'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': "If a positively charged object is brought close to the knob, a separation of charge\nis induced: electrons are attracted up into the knob, and the leaves become posi-\ntively charged, Fig. 16-11a. The two leaves repel each other as shown, because they\nare both positively charged. If, instead, the knob is charged by conduction\n(touching), the whole apparatus acquires a net charge as shown in Fig. 16-11b.\nIn either case, the greater the amount of charge, the greater the separation of\nthe leaves.\nNote that you cannot tell the sign of the charge in this way, since negative\ncharge will cause the leaves to separate just as much as an equal amount of\npositive charge; in either case, the two leaves repel each other. An electroscope\ncan, however, be used to determine the sign of the charge if it is first charged by\nconduction: say, negatively, as in Fig. 16-12a. Now if a negative object is brought\nclose, as in Fig. 16-12b, more electrons are induced to move down into the leaves\nand they separate further. If a positive charge is brought close instead, the\nelectrons are induced to flow upward, so the leaves are less negative and their\nseparation is reduced, Fig. 16-12c.\nThe electroscope was used in the early studies of electricity. The same\nprinciple, aided by some electronics, is used in much more sensitive modern\nelectrometers.\n+\n+++ x\nE\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 16-11 Electroscope charged\n(a) by induction, (b) by conduction.\nFIGURE 16-12 A previously\ncharged electroscope can be used to\ndetermine the sign of a charged object.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n16-5 Coulomb's Law\nWe have seen that an electric charge exerts a force of attraction or repulsion on\nother electric charges. What factors affect the magnitude of this force? To find an\nanswer, the French physicist Charles Coulomb (1736-1806) investigated electric\nforces in the 1780s using a torsion balance (Fig. 16-13) much like that used by\nCavendish for his studies of the gravitational force (Chapter 5).\nPrecise instruments for the measurement of electric charge were not available\nin Coulomb's time. Nonetheless, Coulomb was able to prepare small spheres with\ndifferent magnitudes of charge in which the ratio of the charges was known.+\nAlthough he had some difficulty with induced charges, Coulomb was able to\nargue that the electric force one tiny charged object exerts on a second tiny charged\nobject is directly proportional to the charge on each of them. That is, if the charge\non either one of the objects is doubled, the force is doubled; and if the charge\non both of the objects is doubled, the force increases to four times the original\nvalue. This was the case when the distance between the two charges remained the\nsame. If the distance between them was allowed to increase, he found that\nthe force decreased with the square of the distance between them. That is, if the\ndistance was doubled, the force fell to one-fourth of its original value. Thus,\nCoulomb concluded, the magnitude of the force F that one small charged object\nexerts on a second one is proportional to the product of the magnitude of the\ncharge on one, Q1, times the magnitude of the charge on the other, Q2, and\ninversely proportional to the square of the distance r between them (Fig. 16-14).\nAs an equation, we can write Coulomb's law as\nFIGURE 16-13 Coulomb's apparatus:\nwhen an external charged sphere is\nplaced close to the charged one on the\nsuspended bar, the bar rotates slightly.\nThe suspending fiber resists the\ntwisting motion, and the angle of twist\nis proportional to the force applied. With\nthis apparatus, Coulomb investigated\nhow the electric force varies as a\nfunction of the magnitude of the charges\nand of the distance between them.\nFiber\n+\nRod\n+\nF = k212,\n1.2\n[magnitudes] (16-1)\nCOULOMB'S LAW\nwhere k is a proportionality constant .*\n*Coulomb reasoned that if a charged conducting sphere is placed in contact with an identical uncharged\nsphere, the charge on the first would be shared equally by the two of them because of symmetry. He\nthus had a way to produce charges equal to 2, 4, and so on, of the original charge.\n*The validity of Coulomb's law today rests on precision measurements that are much more sophisticated\nthan Coulomb's original experiment. The exponent 2 on r in Coulomb's law has been shown to be\naccurate to 1 part in 1016 [that is, 2 + (1 × 10-16)].\nFIGURE 16-14 Coulomb's law,\nEq. 16-1, gives the force between two\npoint charges, Q1 and Q2, a distance r\napart.\nQ1\nQ2\nr\nSECTION 16-5 Coulomb's Law 447\n", 'chapter_title': 'Electric Charge and Electric Field'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': "1\n[magnitudes] (16-1)\nF12 = force on 1\ndue to 2\nF12\nF21 = force on 2\ndue to 1\n+\n1\n+\n->F21\n2\n(a)\nF12\n-\n-\n-F21\n2\n(b)\nF 12\nF21\n+\n1\n2\n(c)\nFIGURE 16-15 The direction of the\nstatic electric force one point charge\nexerts on another is always along the\nline joining the two charges, and\ndepends on whether the charges\nhave the same sign as in (a) and (b),\nor opposite signs (c).\nCOULOMB'S LAW\n(in terms of €0)\nAs we just saw, Coulomb's law, Eq. 16-1,\nF = k 212,\ngives the magnitude of the electric force that either charge exerts on the other.\nThe direction of the electric force is always along the line joining the two charges.\nIf the two charges have the same sign, the force on either charge is directed away\nfrom the other (they repel each other). If the two charges have opposite signs,\nthe force on one is directed toward the other (they attract). See Fig. 16-15.\nNotice that the force one charge exerts on the second is equal but opposite to\nthat exerted by the second on the first, in accord with Newton's third law.\nThe SI unit of charge is the coulomb (C). The precise definition of the coulomb\ntoday is in terms of electric current and magnetic field, and will be discussed later\n(Section 20-6). In SI units, the constant k in Coulomb's law has the value\nk = 8.988 × 109 N · m2/C2\nor, when we only need two significant figures,\nk ~ 9.0 × 109 N .m2/C2.\nThus, 1 C is that amount of charge which, if placed on each of two point\nobjects that are 1.0 m apart, will result in each object exerting a force of\n(9.0×109N.m2/C2)(1.0C)(1.0C)/(1.0m)2 =9.0×109N on the other. This\nwould be an enormous force, equal to the weight of almost a million tons. We\nrarely encounter charges as large as a coulomb.+\nCharges produced by rubbing ordinary objects (such as a comb or plastic\nruler) are typically around a microcoulomb (1 uC = 10-6C) or less. Objects that\ncarry a positive charge have a deficit of electrons, whereas negatively charged\nobjects have an excess of electrons. The charge on one electron has been deter-\nmined to have a magnitude of about 1.6022 × 10-19 C, and is negative. This is the\nsmallest charge observed in nature,* and because it is fundamental, it is given the\nsymbol e and is often referred to as the elementary charge:\ne = 1.6022 × 10-19℃ ~ 1.6 × 10-19 C.\nNote that e is defined as a positive number, so the charge on the electron is -e.\n(The charge on a proton, on the other hand, is +e.) Since an object cannot gain or\nlose a fraction of an electron, the net charge on any object must be an integral\nmultiple of this charge. Electric charge is thus said to be quantized (existing only\nin discrete amounts: 1e, 2e, 3e, etc.). Because e is so small, however, we normally\ndo not notice this discreteness in macroscopic charges (1 uC requires about 1013\nelectrons), which thus seem continuous.\nCoulomb's law looks a lot like the law of universal gravitation, F = Gm1 m2/ r2,\nwhich expresses the magnitude of the gravitational force a mass m1 exerts on a\nmass m2 (Eq. 5-4). Both are inverse square laws (F x 1/r2). Both also have a\nproportionality to a property of each object-mass for gravity, electric charge for\nelectricity. And both act over a distance (that is, there is no need for contact).\nA major difference between the two laws is that gravity is always an attractive force,\nwhereas the electric force can be either attractive or repulsive. Electric charge\ncomes in two types, positive and negative; gravitational mass is only positive.\nThe constant k in Eq. 16-1 is often written in terms of another constant, €0,\ncalled the permittivity of free space. It is related to k by k = 1/4TTE,. Coulomb's\nlaw can be written\n1\nATTEO r2\n,\nF\n=\n(16-2)\nwhere\nEo =\n1\n= 8.85 × 10-12 C2/N ·m2.\n*In the once common cgs system of units, k is set equal to 1, and the unit of electric charge is called the\nelectrostatic unit (esu) or the statcoulomb. One esu is defined as that charge, on each of two point\nobjects 1 cm apart, that gives rise to a force of 1 dyne.\n*According to the Standard Model of elementary particle physics, subnuclear particles called quarks\nhave a smaller charge than the electron, equal to Je or ge. Quarks have not been detected directly as\nisolated objects, and theory indicates that free quarks may not be detectable.\n448 CHAPTER 16\n", 'chapter_title': 'Electric Charge and Electric Field'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Equation 16-2 looks more complicated than Eq. 16-1, but other fundamental\nequations we haven't seen yet are simpler in terms of €, rather than k.

(The latest\nprecise values of e and €, are given inside the front cover.)*\nEquations 16-1 and 16-2 apply to objects whose size is much smaller than\nthe distance between them. Ideally, it is precise for point charges (spatial size\nnegligible compared to other distances). For finite-sized objects, it is not always\nclear what value to use for r, particularly since the charge may not be distributed\nuniformly on the objects. If the two objects are spheres and the charge is known\nto be distributed uniformly on each, then r is the distance between their centers.\nCoulomb's law describes the force between two charges when they are at rest.\nAdditional forces come into play when charges are in motion, and will be dis-\ncussed in later Chapters. In this Chapter we discuss only charges at rest, the study\nof which is called electrostatics, and Coulomb's law gives the electrostatic force.\nWhen calculating with Coulomb's law, we usually use magnitudes, ignoring\nsigns of the charges, and determine the direction of a force separately based on\nwhether the force is attractive or repulsive.\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nUse magnitudes in Coulomb's law;\nfind force direction from signs of charges\nEXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 443, and answer it again\nnow.

The magnitudes of these three forces are determined\nfrom Coulomb's law, and then are added vectorially.\nB\n16-6 Solving Problems Involving\nCoulomb's Law and Vectors\nThe electric force between charged particles at rest (sometimes referred to as the\nelectrostatic force or as the Coulomb force) is, like all forces, a vector: it has both\nmagnitude and direction. When several forces act on an object (call them F1 , F2,\netc.), the net force Fnet on the object is the vector sum of all the forces acting on it:\nF2\n(a) Two forces acting on an object.\nB\nF\nF2\n1\nF (=F1 +F2)\n(b) The total, or net, force is\nF = F1 + F2 by the tail-to-tip\nmethod of adding vectors.\nB\nF\n1\nF (=F +F2)\nF2\n(c) F= F1 + F2 by the\nparallelogram method.\n+y\nB\ni\nB\nly\nB\nF\nLx\nB\n+x\n02\nF\nFnet = F1 + F2 + ....\nThis is the principle of superposition for forces. We studied how to add vectors in\nChapter 3; then in Chapter 4 we used the rules for adding vectors to obtain the\nnet force on an object by adding the different vector forces acting on it. It might\nbe useful now to review Sections 3-2, 3-3, and 3-4. Here is a brief review of vectors.\nVector Addition Review\nSuppose two vector forces, F1 and F2, act on an object (Fig. 16-18a). They can be\nadded using the tail-to-tip method (Fig. 16-18b) or by the parallelogram method\n(Fig. 16-18c), as discussed in Section 3-2. These two methods are useful for\nunderstanding a given problem (for getting a picture in your mind of what is\ngoing on). But for calculating the direction and magnitude of the resultant sum, it\nis more precise to use the method of adding components. Figure 16-18d shows\nthe forces F1 and F2 resolved into components along chosen x and y axes (for\nmore details, see Section 3-4). From the definitions of the trigonometric functions\n(Figs. 3-11 and 3-12), we have\nF1x = F1 cos 01\nF2x = F2 cos 02\nF1y = F1 sin 01\nF2y = - F2 sin 02 .\nWe add up the x and y components separately to obtain the components of the\nresultant force F, which are\nFx = Fix + F2x = F1 cos 01 + F2 cos 02,\nFy = F1y + F2y = F1 sin 01 - F2 sin 02 .\nThe magnitude of the resultant (or net) force F is\n-x\nF2y\nB\nF\n2\nF = VR + F2.\n(d) F1 and F2 resolved into their\nx and y components.\nFIGURE 16-18 Review of vector\naddition.\nThe direction of F is specified by the angle 0 that F makes with the x axis, which is\ngiven by\ntan 0 =\nFy\n.\nFx\nAdding Electric Forces; Principle of Superposition\nWhen dealing with several charges, it is helpful to use double subscripts on each\nof the forces involved. The first subscript refers to the particle on which the force\nacts; the second refers to the particle that exerts the force. For example, if we\nhave three charges, F31 means the force exerted on particle 3 by particle 1.\n450 CHAPTER 16 Electric Charge and Electric Field\n", 'chapter_title': 'Electric Charge and Electric Field'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': "As in all problem solving, it is very important to draw a diagram, in particular\na free-body diagram (Chapter 4) for each object, showing all the forces acting on\nthat object.

The direction of each force will be along the line connecting Q3 to Q1\nor Q2.

The forces F31\nand F32 are not along the same line, so to find the resultant force on Q3 we resolve\nF31 and F32 into x and y components and perform the vector addition.\nSOLUTION The magnitudes of F31 and F32 are (ignoring signs of the charges\nsince we know the directions)\n140 N,\nF31 = k\nr31\nQ3Q1\n=\n(9.0×109N·m2/C2)(6.5×10-5℃)(8.6×10-5℃)\n(0.60 m)2\nQ3 Q2\n=\n(9.0×109 N·m2/C2)(6.5×10-5℃)(5.0×10-5℃)\n325 N.\nF32 = k\nr32\n(0.30 m)2\n(We keep 3 significant figures until the end, and then keep 2 because only 2 are\ngiven.) We resolve F31 into its components along the x and y axes, as shown in\nFig. 16-20a:\nF31x = F31 cos 30° = (140 N) cos 30° = 120 N,\nF31y = - F31 sin 30° = - (140 N) sin 30° = - 70 N.\nThe force F32 has only a y component. So the net force F on Q3 has components\nFx = F31x = 120 N,\nFy = F32 + F31y = 325 N - 70N = 255 N.\nThe magnitude of the net force is\nF= VF2 + F2 = \\ (120N)2 + (255 N)2 = 280 N;\nand it acts at an angle 0 (see Fig. 16-20b) given by\ntan 0 =\nFy\n=\n255 N\n120 N\n= 2.13,\nFx\nso 0 = tan-1(2.13) = 65°.\nNOTE Because F31 and F32 are not along the same line, the magnitude of F3 is\nnot equal to the sum (or difference as in Example 16-3) of the separate magni-\ntudes. That is, F3 is not equal to F31 + F32; nor does it equal F32 - F31 . Instead\nwe had to do vector addition.\n452 CHAPTER 16 Electric Charge and Electric Field\n", 'chapter_title': 'Electric Charge and Electric Field'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 16-5\nMake the force on Q3 zero. In Fig. 16-20,\nwhere could you place a fourth charge, Q4 = - 50 uC, so that the net force on\nQ3 would be zero?\nRESPONSE By the principle of superposition, we need a force in exactly the\nopposite direction to the resultant F due to Q2 and Q1 that we calculated in\nExample 16-4, Fig. 16-20b. Our force must have magnitude 290 N, and must\npoint down and to the left of Q3 in Fig. 16-20b, in the direction opposite to F.\nSo Q4 must be along this line. See Fig. 16-21.\n| EXERCISE D In Example 16-5, what distance r must Q4 be from Q3 ?\nEXERCISE E (a) Consider two point charges, +Q and -Q, which are fixed a distance d\napart. Can you find a location where a third positive charge Q could be placed so that\nthe net electric force on this third charge is zero? (b) What if the first two charges were\nboth +Q?\n16-7 The Electric Field\nMany common forces might be referred to as "contact forces," such as your hands\npushing or pulling a cart, or a tennis racket hitting a tennis ball.\nIn contrast, both the gravitational force and the electrical force act over a dis-\ntance: there is a force between two objects even when the objects are not touching.\nThe idea of a force acting at a distance was a difficult one for early thinkers.\nNewton himself felt uneasy with this idea when he published his law of universal\ngravitation. A helpful way to look at the situation uses the idea of the field, devel-\noped by the British scientist Michael Faraday (1791-1867). In the electrical case,\naccording to Faraday, an electric field extends outward from every charge and\npermeates all of space (Fig. 16-22). If a second charge (call it Q2) is placed near\nthe first charge, it feels a force exerted by the electric field that is there (say, at\npoint P in Fig. 16-22). The electric field at point P is considered to interact directly\nwith charge Q2 to produce the force on Q2.\nWe can in principle investigate the electric field surrounding a charge or\ngroup of charges by measuring the force on a small positive test charge which is\nat rest. By a test charge we mean a charge so small that the force it exerts does\nnot significantly affect the charges that create the field. If a tiny positive test\ncharge q is placed at various locations in the vicinity of a single positive charge Q\nas shown in Fig. 16-23 (points A, B, C), the force exerted on q is as shown. The\nforce at B is less than at A because B\'s distance from Q is greater (Coulomb\'s\nlaw); and the force at C is smaller still. In each case, the force on q is directed\nradially away from Q. The electric field is defined in terms of the force on such a\npositive test charge. In particular, the electric field, E, at any point in space is\ndefined as the force F exerted on a tiny positive test charge placed at that point\ndivided by the magnitude of the test charge q:\nB\nE\n=\n.\nB\nF\n(16-3)\nq\nMore precisely, È is defined as the limit of F/q as q is taken smaller and smaller,\napproaching zero. That is, q is so tiny that it exerts essentially no force on the\nother charges which created the field. From this definition (Eq. 16-3), we see that\nthe electric field at any point in space is a vector whose direction is the direction\nof the force on a tiny positive test charge at that point, and whose magnitude is\nthe force per unit charge. Thus E has SI units of newtons per coulomb (N/C).\nThe reason for defining E as F/q (with q -> 0) is so that E does not depend\non the magnitude of the test charge q. This means that E describes only the effect\nof the charges creating the electric field at that point.\ny\nF=F31+ F32\nTQ3.\n0 = 65°\nx\n115°\nr = ?\nF34\nQ4\nFIGURE 16-21 Example 16-5 and\nExercise D: Q4 exerts force (F34) that\nmakes the net force on Q3 zero.\nFIGURE 16-22 An electric field\nsurrounds every charge.

Then\nEB= 2EB1 COS 0 = 2(2.8×106N/C)(0.65) = 3.6 × 106 N/C,\nand the direction of EB is along the +x direction.\n16-8 Electric Field Lines\nSince the electric field is a vector, it is sometimes referred to as a vector field. We\ncould indicate the electric field with arrows at various points in a given situation,\nsuch as at A, B, and C in Fig. 16-30. The directions of EA, EB, and Ec are the\nsame as for the forces shown earlier in Fig. 16-23, but the magnitudes (arrow\nlengths) are different since we divide F by q to get E. However, the relative\nlengths of EA, EB, and Ec are the same as for the forces since we divide by the\nsame q each time. To indicate the electric field in such a way at many points,\nhowever, would result in many arrows, which would quickly become cluttered and\nconfusing. To avoid this, we use another technique, that of field lines.\nTo visualize the electric field, we draw a series of lines to indicate the direction\nof the electric field at various points in space. These electric field lines (or lines of\nforce) are drawn to indicate the direction of the force due to the given field on a\npositive test charge. The lines of force due to a single isolated positive charge are\nshown in Fig. 16-31a, and for a single isolated negative charge in Fig. 16-31b. In\npart (a) the lines point radially outward from the charge, and in part (b) they point\nradially inward toward the charge because that is the direction the force would be\non a positive test charge in each case (as in Fig. 16-26). Only a few representative\nlines are shown. We could draw lines in between those shown since the electric field\nexists there as well. We can draw the lines so that the number of lines starting on a\npositive charge, or ending on a negative charge, is proportional to the magnitude\nof the charge. Notice that nearer the charge, where the electric field is greater\n(F x 1/r2), the lines are closer together. This is a general property of electric\nfield lines: the closer together the lines are, the stronger the electric field in that\nregion. In fact, field lines can be drawn so that the number of lines crossing unit\narea perpendicular to E is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field.\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nUse symmetry to save work,\nwhen possible\nEA\nBA\n·+Q\nC.\nEc\nB\nEB\nFIGURE 16-30 Electric field vector,\nshown at three points, due to a\nsingle point charge Q.

The electric field lines\nare curved in this case and are directed from the positive charge to the negative\ncharge. The direction of the electric field at any point is tangent to the field line at\nthat point as shown by the vector arrow E at point P. To satisfy yourself that this\nis the correct pattern for the electric field lines, you can make a few calculations\nsuch as those done in Examples 16-9 and 16-10 for just this case (see Fig. 16-29).\nFigure 16-32b shows the electric field lines for two equal positive charges, and\nFig. 16-32c for unequal charges, -Q and +2Q. Note that twice as many lines\nleave +2Q as enter -Q (number of lines is proportional to magnitude of Q).\nFinally, in Fig. 16-32d, we see in cross section the field lines between two flat\nparallel plates carrying equal but opposite charges. Notice that the electric field\nlines between the two plates start out perpendicular to the surface of the metal\nplates (we will see why this is true in the next Section) and go directly from one\nplate to the other, as we expect because a positive test charge placed between\nthe plates would feel a strong repulsion from the positive plate and a strong\nattraction to the negative plate.

Thus, in the central region, the electric field has the same magnitude at\nall points, and we can write\n+2Q\nE = constant.\nbetween two closely spaced, oppositely\ncharged, flat parallel plates\nd\n(16-6)\n(c)\n+Q\n-Q\n+\n−\n+\n−\n+\n−\n+\n+\n−\n+\n−\n+\n−\n−\n+\n+\n+\n−\n(d)\nFIGURE 16-32 Electric field lines\nfor four arrangements of charges.\nFIGURE 16-33 The Earth's\ngravitational field, which at any\npoint is directed toward the Earth's\ncenter (the force on any mass points\ntoward the Earth's center).\nThe fringing of the field near the edges can often be ignored, particularly if the\nseparation of the plates is small compared to their height and width.+ We summarize\nthe properties of field lines as follows:\n1. Electric field lines indicate the direction of the electric field; the field points\nin the direction tangent to the field line at any point.\n2. The lines are drawn so that the magnitude of the electric field, E, is propor-\ntional to the number of lines crossing unit area perpendicular to the lines.\nThe closer together the lines, the stronger the field.\n3. Electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges;\nand the number starting or ending is proportional to the magnitude of the\ncharge.\nAlso note that field lines never cross. Why not? Because it would not make sense\nfor the electric field to have two directions at the same point.\nGravitational Field\nThe field concept can also be applied to the gravitational force (Chapter 5). Thus we\ncan say that a gravitational field exists for every object that has mass. One object\nattracts another by means of the gravitational field. The Earth, for example,\ncan be said to possess a gravitational field (Fig. 16-33) which is responsible for\nthe gravitational force on objects. The gravitational field is defined as the\nforce per unit mass. The magnitude of the Earth's gravitational field at any point\nabove the Earth's surface is thus GME/r2, where ME is the mass of the Earth,\nr is the distance of the point from the Earth's center, and G is the gravitational\nconstant (Chapter 5). At the Earth's surface, r is the radius of the Earth and the\ngravitational field is equal to g, the acceleration due to gravity. Beyond the Earth,\nthe gravitational field can be calculated at any point as a sum of terms due to Earth,\nSun, Moon, and other bodies that contribute significantly.\n*The magnitude of the constant electric field between two parallel plates is given by E = Q/60 A,\nwhere Q is the magnitude of the charge on each plate and A is the area of one plate. We show this in\nthe optional Section 16-12 on Gauss's law.\n458 CHAPTER 16 Electric Charge and Electric Field\n", 'chapter_title': 'Electric Charge and Electric Field'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': '+\n16-9 Electric Fields and Conductors\nConductor\n−\nWe now discuss some properties of conductors. First, the electric field inside a\nconductor is zero in the static situation-that is, when the charges are at rest. If\nthere were an electric field within a conductor, there would be a force on the free\nelectrons. The electrons would move until they reached positions where the electric\nfield, and therefore the electric force on them, did become zero.\n+\nThis reasoning has some interesting consequences. For one, any net charge on\na conductor distributes itself on the surface. For a negatively charged conductor,\nyou can imagine that the negative charges repel one another and race to the sur-\nface to get as far from one another as possible. Another consequence is the following.\nSuppose that a positive charge Q is surrounded by an isolated uncharged metal\nconductor whose shape is a spherical shell, Fig. 16-34. Because there can be no\nfield within the metal, the lines leaving the central positive charge must end on\nnegative charges on the inner surface of the metal. That is, the encircled charge\n+Q induces an equal amount of negative charge, -Q, on the inner surface of\nthe spherical shell. Since the shell is neutral, a positive charge of the same\nmagnitude, +Q, must exist on the outer surface of the shell. Thus, although no\nfield exists in the metal itself, an electric field exists outside of it, as shown in\nFig. 16-34, as if the metal were not even there.\nA related property of static electric fields and conductors is that the electric\nfield is always perpendicular to the surface outside of a conductor. If there were a\ncomponent of E parallel to the surface (Fig. 16-35), it would exert a force on free\nelectrons at the surface, causing the electrons to move along the surface until\nthey reached positions where no net force was exerted on them parallel to the\nsurface-that is, until the electric field was perpendicular to the surface.\nThese properties apply only to conductors. Inside a nonconductor, which\ndoes not have free electrons, a static electric field can exist as we will see in the next\nChapter. Also, the electric field outside a nonconductor does not necessarily make\nan angle of 90° to the surface.\nFIGURE 16-36 Example 16-11.\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n++ ++++++++++ + +\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n++ ++ + + +++++ + + +\n+ + +\n+\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n(a)\n(b)\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 16-11\nShielding, and safety in a storm. A neu-\ntral hollow metal box is placed between two parallel charged plates as shown in\nFig. 16-36a. What is the field like inside the box?\nRESPONSE If our metal box had been solid, and not hollow, free electrons in\nthe box would have redistributed themselves along the surface until all their\nindividual fields would have canceled each other inside the box. The net field\ninside the box would have been zero. For a hollow box, the external field is not\nchanged since the electrons in the metal can move just as freely as before to the\nsurface. Hence the field inside the hollow metal box is also zero, and the field lines\nare shown in Fig. 16-36b. A conducting box is an effective device for shielding\ndelicate instruments and electronic circuits from unwanted external electric fields.\nWe also can see that a relatively safe place to be during a lightning storm is inside\na parked car, surrounded by metal. See also Fig. 16-37, where a person inside a\nporous "cage" is protected from a strong electric discharge.

It is an important area for application of physics.\nThe interior of every biological cell is mainly water. We can imagine a cell as a thick\nsoup of molecules continually in motion (kinetic theory, Chapter 13), colliding with\none another with various amounts of kinetic energy. These molecules interact\nwith one another because of the electrostatic force between molecules.\nIndeed, cellular processes are now considered to be the result of random\n("thermal") molecular motion plus the ordering effect of the electrostatic force. As\nan example, we look at DNA structure and replication. The picture we present\nis a model of what happens based on physical theories and experiment.\nThe genetic information that is passed on from generation to generation in all\nliving cells is contained in the chromosomes, which are made up of genes. Each\ngene contains the information needed to produce a particular type of protein mol-\necule, and that information is built into the principal molecule of a chromosome,\nDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), Fig. 16-38. DNA molecules are made up of many\nsmall molecules known as nucleotide bases which are each polar (Section 16-2)\ndue to unequal sharing of electrons. There are four types of nucleotide bases in\nDNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).\nThe DNA of a chromosome generally consists of two long DNA strands wrapped\nabout one another in the shape of a "double helix." The genetic information is\ncontained in the specific order of the four bases (A, C, G, T) along each strand. As\nshown in Fig. 16-39, the two strands are attracted by electrostatic forces-that is,\nby the attraction of positive charges to negative charges that exist on parts of the\nmolecules. We see in Fig. 16-39a that an A (adenine) on one strand is always oppo-\nsite a T on the other strand; similarly, a G is always opposite a C. This important\nordering effect occurs because the shapes of A, T, C, and G are such that a T fits\nclosely only into an A, and a G into a C. Only in the case of this close proximity of\nthe charged portions is the electrostatic force great enough to hold them together\neven for a short time (Fig. 16-39b), forming what are referred to as "weak bonds."\nA\nC\nG\nT\nAK\nG\nC\nA\nC\nG\nThymine (T)\nH\nC\nH\nT\nH\n....\n|0.280 nm+/\nH\nAdenine (A)\nG\nO . . .

These charges are due to some electrons in\neach of these molecules spending more time orbiting one atom than another.\nFor example, the electron normally on the H atom of adenine (upper part of\nFig. 16-39b) spends some of its time orbiting the adjacent N atom (more on this\nin Chapter 29), so the N has a net negative charge and the H is left with a net positive\ncharge. This H+ atom of adenine is then attracted to the O" atom of thymine.\nThese net + and - charges usually have magnitudes of a fraction of e (charge on\nthe electron) such as 0.2e or 0.4e. (This is what we mean by "polar" molecules.)\n[When H+ is involved, the weak bond it can make with a nearby negative\ncharge, such as O", is relatively strong (partly because H+ is so small) and is\nreferred to as a hydrogen bond (Section 29-3).]\nWhen the DNA replicates (duplicates) itself just before cell division, the\narrangement of A opposite T and G opposite C is crucial for ensuring that the\ngenetic information is passed on accurately to the next generation, Fig. 16-40.\nThe two strands of DNA separate (with the help of enzymes, which also operate\nvia the electrostatic force), leaving the charged parts of the bases exposed.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nDNA replication\nOld\nA\nC\nT\nA\nT\nNew\nA\nG\nT\nT\nA\n2\nT\nA\nA\nNew\nT\nNew\n4\nA\nG\nT\nT\nA\n3\nC\nG\nT\nA JA\nT\nT\nA\nA\nNew\nOld\nT\nC\n1\nG\nOld\nC\nOld\nA\nT\nA\nT\nT\nG\nA\nG\nG\nT\nA\nC\nA\nT\nT\nC\nC\nC\nC\nA\nG\nT\nC\nG\nG\nA\nC\nOld\n1\nT\nT\nG\nG\nG\nA\nA\nA\nT\nA\nC\nT\nOld\n2\nFIGURE 16-40 Replication of DNA.\nG\nG\nC\nOnce replication starts, let us see how the correct order of bases occurs by\nlooking at the G molecule indicated by the red arrow in Fig. 16-40. Many unat-\ntached nucleotide bases of all four kinds are bouncing around in the cellular\nfluid, and the only type that will experience attraction to our G, if it comes close\nto it, will be a C. The charges on the other three bases can not get close enough to\nthose on the G to provide a significant attractive force-remember that the\nelectrostatic (Coulomb) force decreases rapidly with distance (x 1/r2). Because\nthe G does not attract an A, T, or G appreciably, an A, T, or G will be knocked\naway by collisions with other molecules before enzymes can attach it to the\ngrowing chain (number 3 in Fig. 16-40). But the electrostatic force will often hold\na C opposite our G long enough so that an enzyme can attach the C to the growing\nend of the new chain. Thus electrostatic forces are responsible for selecting the\nbases in the proper order during replication. Note in Fig. 16-40 that the new\nnumber 4 strand has the same order of bases as the old number 1 strand; and the\nnew number 3 strand is the same as the old number 2. So the two new double\nhelixes, 1-3 and 2-4, are identical to the original 1-2 helix. Hence the genetic\ninformation is passed on accurately to the next generation.\nThis process of DNA replication is often presented as if it occurred in clock-\nwork fashion-as if each molecule knew its role and went to its assigned place. But\nthis is not the case. The forces of attraction are rather weak and become significant\nonly when charged parts of the two molecules have "complementary shapes," meaning\nthey can get close enough so that the electrostatic force (x 1/r2) is strong enough\nto form weak bonds. If the molecular shapes are not just right, there is almost no\nelectrostatic attraction, which is why there are so few mistakes. Thus, out of the ran-\ndom motion of the molecules, the electrostatic force acts to bring order out of chaos.\n*SECTION 16-10 461\n', 'chapter_title': 'Electric Charge and Electric Field'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The random (thermal) velocities of molecules in a cell affect cloning.

Loosely\nheld parts of large molecules such as a methyl group (CH3) can also be knocked\noff by a strong collision with another molecule. Hence, cloned organisms are not\nidentical, even if their DNA were identical. Indeed, there can not really be\ngenetic determinism.\n*\n16-11 Photocopy Machines and\nComputer Printers Use Electrostatics\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nPhotocopy machines\nPhotocopy machines and laser printers use electrostatic attraction to print an image.\nThey each use a different technique to project an image onto a special cylindrical\ndrum (or rotating conveyor belt). The drum is typically made of aluminum, a good\nconductor; its surface is coated with a thin layer of selenium, which has the inter-\nesting property (called "photoconductivity") of being an electrical nonconductor\nin the dark, but a conductor when exposed to light.\nIn a photocopier, lenses and mirrors focus an image of the original sheet of\npaper onto the drum, much like a camera lens focuses an image on an electronic\ndetector or film. Step 1, done in the dark, is the placing of a uniform positive\ncharge on the drum\'s selenium layer by a charged roller or rod: see Fig. 16-41.\nFIGURE 16-41 Inside a photocopy\nmachine: (1) the selenium drum is given\na + charge; (2) the lens focuses image\non drum-only dark spots stay charged;\n(3) toner particles (negatively charged)\nare attracted to positive areas on drum;\n(4) the image is transferred to paper;\n(5) heat binds the image to the paper.\n(3) Toner hopper\n(4) Paper\nCharging rod\n(2) Lens focuses image of original\n(1) Charging rod or roller\n(5) Heater rollers\nIn step 2, the image to be copied is projected onto the drum. For simplicity, let us\nassume the image is a dark letter A on a white background (as on the page of a\nbook) as shown in Fig. 16-41. The letter A on the drum is dark, but all around it\nis light. At all these light places, the selenium becomes conducting and electrons\nflow in from the aluminum beneath, neutralizing those positive areas. In the dark\nareas of the letter A, the selenium is nonconducting and so retains the positive\ncharge already put on it, Fig. 16-41. In step 3, a fine dark powder known as toner\nis given a negative charge, and is brushed on the drum as it rotates. The negatively\ncharged toner particles are attracted to the positive areas on the drum (the A in\nour case) and stick only there. In step 4, the rotating drum presses against a piece\nof paper which has been positively charged more strongly than the selenium, so\nthe toner particles are transferred to the paper, forming the final image. Finally,\nstep 5, the paper is heated to fix the toner particles firmly on the paper.\nIn a color copier (or printer), this process is repeated for each color-black,\ncyan (blue), magenta (red), and yellow. Combining these four colors in different\nproportions produces any desired color.\n*The separate genes of a DNA double helix can be covered by protein molecules, keeping those genes\nfrom being "expressed"-that is, translated into the proteins they code for (see Section 29-3).\n462 CHAPTER 16 Electric Charge and Electric Field\n', 'chapter_title': 'Electric Charge and Electric Field'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Laser beam scans\nLaser\nToner hopper\nMovable\nmirror\nPaper\nFIGURE 16-42 Inside a laser\nprinter: a movable mirror sweeps\nthe laser beam in horizontal lines\nacross the drum.\nHeater rollers\nA laser printer uses a computer output to program the intensity of a laser\nbeam onto the selenium-coated drum of Fig. 16-42. The thin beam of light from\nthe laser is scanned (by a movable mirror) from side to side across the drum in a\nseries of horizontal lines, each line just below the previous line. As the beam\nsweeps across the drum, the intensity of the beam is varied by the computer\noutput, being strong for a point that is meant to be white or bright, and weak or zero\nfor points that are meant to come out dark. After each sweep, the drum rotates very\nslightly for additional sweeps, Fig. 16-42, until a complete image is formed on it.\nThe light parts of the selenium become conducting and lose their (previously\ngiven) positive electric charge, and the toner sticks only to the dark, electrically\ncharged areas.

For a uniform electric field E passing through\nan area A, as shown in Fig. 16-43a, the electric flux PE is defined as\nθ\nФЕ = EA cos 0,\nwhere 0 is the angle between the electric field direction and a line drawn per-\npendicular to the area.

Therefore,\nPE = > EL AA & Qencl .\nclosed\nsurface\nThe constant of proportionality, to be consistent with Coulomb\'s law, is 1/60, so\nwe have\n¿ E_ AA =\nEO\nLencl\n(16-9)\nclosed\nsurface\nwhere the sum (2) is over any closed surface, and Qencl is the net charge enclosed\nwithin that surface. This is Gauss\'s law.\nCoulomb\'s law and Gauss\'s law can be used to determine the electric field\ndue to a given (static) charge distribution. Gauss\'s law is useful when the charge\ndistribution is simple and symmetrical. However, we must choose the closed\n"gaussian" surface very carefully so we can determine E. We normally choose a\nsurface that has just the symmetry needed so that E will be constant on all or on\nparts of its surface.\nEXAMPLE 16-12\nCharged spherical conducting shell. A thin spherical\nshell of radius r0 possesses a total net charge Q that is uniformly distributed on it,\nFig. 16-45. Determine the electric field at points (a) outside the shell, and\n(b) inside the shell.\nAPPROACH Because the charge is distributed symmetrically, the electric field\nmust be symmetric. Thus the field outside the shell must be directed radially\noutward (inward if Q < 0) and must depend only on r.\nSOLUTION (a) We choose our imaginary gaussian surface as a sphere of radius r\n(r > ro) concentric with the shell, shown in Fig. 16-45 as the dashed circle A1 .\nThen, by symmetry, the electric field will have the same magnitude at all points\non this gaussian surface. Because E is perpendicular to this surface, Gauss\'s law\ngives (with Qencl = Q in Eq. 16-9)\nDELAA = ELAA = E(4Tr2) = 2,\n+\nwhere 4Tr2 is the surface area of our sphere (gaussian surface) of radius r. Thus\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nE =\n1 Q\n.\n4TTE0 r2\n[r > ro]\nWe see that the field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as if\nall the charge were concentrated at the center as a point charge.\n464 CHAPTER 16 Electric Charge and Electric Field\n', 'chapter_title': 'Electric Charge and Electric Field'}, {'page_number': 23, 'type': 'text', 'content': '(b) Inside the shell, the electric field must also be symmetric. So E must again\nhave the same value at all points on a spherical gaussian surface (A2 in Fig. 16-45)\nconcentric with the shell. Thus, E can be factored out of the sum and, with\nQencl = 0 because the charge inside surface A2 is zero, we have\n¿EL AA = EÇAA\n= E(4Tr2) =\n€0\nQencl\n= 0.\nHence\nE = 0\n[r < ro]\ninside a uniform spherical shell of charge (as claimed in Section 16-9).\nThe results of Example 16-12 also apply to a uniform solid spherical conductor\nthat is charged, since all the charge would lie in a thin layer at the surface\n(Section 16-9). In particular\nE =\n1 Q\nATTEO r2\noutside a spherical conductor. Thus, the electric field outside a spherically symmetric\ndistribution of charge is the same as for a point charge of the same magnitude at\nthe center of the sphere. This result applies also outside a uniformly charged\nnonconductor, because we can use the same gaussian surface A1 (Fig. 16-45) and\nthe same symmetry argument. We can also consider this a demonstration of our\nstatement in Chapter 5 about the gravitational force, which is also a perfect 1/r2\nforce: The gravitational force exerted by a uniform sphere is the same as if all the\nmass were at the center, as stated on page 120.\nEXAMPLE 16-13\nE near any conducting surface. Show that the magnitude\nof the electric field just outside the surface of a good conductor of any shape is\ngiven by\nE = g,\nEO\nwhere o is defined as the surface charge density, Q/ A, on the conductor\'s surface\nat that point.\nAPPROACH We choose as our gaussian surface a small cylindrical box, very\nsmall in height so that one of its circular ends is just above the conductor\n(Fig. 16-46). The other end is just below the conductor\'s surface, and the very\nshort sides are perpendicular to it.\nSOLUTION The electric field is zero inside a conductor and is perpendicular to\nthe surface just outside it (Section 16-9), so electric flux passes only through\nthe outside end of our cylindrical box; no flux passes through the very short sides\nor through the inside end of our gaussian box. We choose the area A (of the flat\ncylinder end above the conductor surface) small enough so that E is essentially\nuniform over it. Then Gauss\'s law gives\n¿EL AA = EA =\nE0\nQencl\nJA\n,\nEo\nand therefore\nFIGURE 16-46 Electric field near\nthe surface of a conductor. Two\nsmall cylindrical boxes are shown\ndashed.

Each electron has a charge\n-e = - 1.60 × 10-19 C.\nElectric conductors are those materials in which many\nelectrons are relatively free to move, whereas electric insulators\nor nonconductors are those in which very few electrons are\nfree to move.\nAn object is negatively charged when it has an excess of\nelectrons, and positively charged when it has less than its\nnormal number of electrons. The net charge on any object is a\nwhole number times +e or -e. That is, charge is quantized.\nAn object can become charged by rubbing (in which\nelectrons are transferred from one material to another),\nby conduction (which is transfer of charge from one charged\nobject to another by touching), or by induction (the separation\nof charge within an object because of the close approach of\nanother charged object but without touching).\nElectric charges exert a force on each other. If two charges\nare of opposite types, one positive and one negative, they each\nexert an attractive force on the other. If the two charges are\nthe same type, each repels the other.\nThe magnitude of the force one point charge exerts on\nanother is proportional to the product of their charges, and\ninversely proportional to the square of the distance between\nthem:\nF = k\nQ1Q2\n1\n(16-1, 16-2)\n=\nQ102\n4TTEO r2\nthis is Coulomb's law.\n12\nWe think of an electric field as existing in space around any\ncharge or group of charges. The force on another charged object\nis then said to be due to the electric field present at its location.\nThe electric field, E, at any point in space due to one or\nmore charges, is defined as the force per unit charge that would\nact on a tiny positive test charge q placed at that point:\nB\nĒ =\nq\n(16-3)\n.\nThe magnitude of the electric field a distance r from a point\ncharge Q is\nE = kg.\n(16-4a)\nThe total electric field at a point in space is equal to the\nvector sum of the individual fields due to each contributing\ncharge. This is the principle of superposition.\nElectric fields are represented by electric field lines that\nstart on positive charges and end on negative charges. Their\ndirection indicates the direction the force would be on a tiny\npositive test charge placed at each point. The lines can be drawn\nso that the number per unit area is proportional to the magni-\ntude of E.\nThe static electric field inside a conductor is zero, and the\nelectric field lines just outside a charged conductor are perpen-\ndicular to its surface.\n[*In the replication of DNA, the electrostatic force plays\na crucial role in selecting the proper molecules so that the\ngenetic information is passed on accurately from generation to\ngeneration.]\n[*Photocopiers and computer printers use electric charge\nplaced on toner particles and a drum to form an image.]\n[*The electric flux passing through a small area A for a\nuniform electric field È is\nPE = ELA,\n(16-7)\nwhere E_ is the component of E perpendicular to the surface.\nThe flux through a surface is proportional to the number of\nfield lines passing through it.]\n[*Gauss's law states that the total flux summed over any\nclosed surface (considered as made up of many small areas A A)\nis equal to the net charge Qencl enclosed by the surface divided\nby €0 :\n(16-9)\nclosed\nsurface\n≥ E_ AA = Lencl\n.\nGauss's law can be used to determine the electric field due to\ngiven charge distributions, but its usefulness is mainly limited to\ncases where the charge distribution displays much symmetry. The\nreal importance of Gauss's law is that it is a general and elegant\nstatement of the relation between electric charge and electric field.]\n466 CHAPTER 16 Electric Charge and Electric Field\n", 'chapter_title': 'Electric Charge and Electric Field'}, {'page_number': 25, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Questions\n1.
