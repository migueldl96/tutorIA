Many individuals contributed to this understanding,\nparticularly Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) and Isaac Newton (1642-1727).\nThe study of the motion of objects, and the related concepts of force and energy,\nform the field called mechanics.

In this Chapter we will be concerned\nwith describing an object that moves along a straight-line path, which is one-\ndimensional translational motion. In Chapter 3 we will describe translational\nmotion in two (or three) dimensions along paths that are not straight. (Rotation,\nshown in Fig. 2-1b, is discussed in Chapter 8.)\nWe will often use the concept, or model, of an idealized particle which is\nconsidered to be a mathematical point with no spatial extent (no size). A point\nparticle can undergo only translational motion. The particle model is useful in\nmany real situations where we are interested only in translational motion and\nthe object\'s size is not significant. For example, we might consider a billiard ball,\nor even a spacecraft traveling toward the Moon, as a particle for many purposes.\n2-1 Reference Frames and Displacement\nAny measurement of position, distance, or speed must be made with respect to a\nreference frame, or frame of reference. For example, while you are on a train\ntraveling at 80 km/h, suppose a person walks past you toward the front of the\ntrain at a speed of, say, 5 km/h (Fig. 2-2). This 5 km/h is the person\'s speed\nwith respect to the train as frame of reference. With respect to the ground,\nthat person is moving at a speed of 80 km/h + 5 km/h = 85 km/h. It is always\nimportant to specify the frame of reference when stating a speed. In everyday\nlife, we usually mean "with respect to the Earth" without even thinking about it,\nbut the reference frame must be specified whenever there might be confusion.\nFIGURE 2-2 A person walks toward the front of a train at 5 km/h.\nThe train is moving 80 km/h with respect to the ground, so the\nwalking person\'s speed, relative to the ground, is 85 km/h.\nWhen specifying the motion of an object, it is important to specify not only\nthe speed but also the direction of motion. Often we can specify a direction by\nusing north, east, south, and west, and by "up" and "down." In physics, we\noften draw a set of coordinate axes, as shown in Fig. 2-3, to represent a frame\nof reference. We can always place the origin 0, and the directions of the x and\ny axes, as we like for convenience. The x and y axes are always perpendicular\nto each other. The origin is where x = 0, y = 0. Objects positioned to the right\nof the origin of coordinates (0) on the x axis have an x coordinate which we\nalmost always choose to be positive; then points to the left of 0 have a negative\nx coordinate. The position along the y axis is usually considered positive when\nabove 0, and negative when below 0, although the reverse convention can be used\nif convenient. Any point on the plane can be specified by giving its x and y coor-\ndinates. In three dimensions, a z axis perpendicular to the x and y axes is added.\nFor one-dimensional motion, we often choose the x axis as the line along\nwhich the motion takes place. Then the position of an object at any moment is\ngiven by its x coordinate. If the motion is vertical, as for a dropped object, we\nusually use the y axis.\n22 CHAPTER 2 Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension\n', 'chapter_title': 'Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'We need to make a distinction between the distance an object has traveled\nand its displacement, which is defined as the change in position of the\nobject. That is, displacement is how far the object is from its starting point.\nTo see the distinction between total distance and displacement, imagine a person\nwalking 70 m to the east and then turning around and walking back (west) a\ndistance of 30 m (see Fig. 2-4). The total distance traveled is 100 m, but the\ndisplacement is only 40 m since the person is now only 40 m from the starting point.\nDisplacement is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. Such\nquantities are called vectors, and are represented by arrows in diagrams. For\nexample, in Fig. 2-4, the blue arrow represents the displacement whose magni-\ntude is 40 m and whose direction is to the right (east).\nWe will deal with vectors more fully in Chapter 3. For now, we deal only with\nmotion in one dimension, along a line. In this case, vectors which point in one direc-\ntion will be positive (typically to the right along the x axis). Vectors that point\nin the opposite direction will have a negative sign in front of their magnitude.\nConsider the motion of an object over a particular time interval. Suppose that\nat some initial time, call it t1, the object is on the x axis at the position x1 in the\ncoordinate system shown in Fig. 2-5. At some later time, t2, suppose the object\nhas moved to position x2. The displacement of our object is x2 - x1, and is\nrepresented by the arrow pointing to the right in Fig. 2-5. It is convenient to write\nAx = X2 - X1,\nwhere the symbol 4 (Greek letter delta) means "change in." Then Ax means\n"the change in x," or "change in position," which is the displacement. The change in\nany quantity means the final value of that quantity, minus the initial value.\nSuppose x1 = 10.0 m and x2 = 30.0m, as in Fig. 2-5. Then\nAx = x2 - x1 = 30.0m - 10.0m = 20.0 m,\nso the displacement is 20.0 m in the positive direction, Fig. 2-5.\nCAUTION\nThe displacement may not equal the\ntotal distance traveled\ny\n70 m\nWest\n0\n40 m\nx\n30 m\nEast\nDisplacement\nFIGURE 2-4 A person walks 70 m\neast, then 30 m west.

In this case her displacement is\n4.x = x2 - X1 = 10.0m - 30.0m = - 20.0m,\nand the blue arrow representing the vector displacement points to the left. For\none-dimensional motion along the x axis, a vector pointing to the right is\npositive, whereas a vector pointing to the left has a negative sign.\nEXERCISE A An ant starts at x = 20 cm on a piece of graph paper and walks along\nthe x axis to x = - 20 cm. It then turns around and walks back to x = - 10 cm.\nDetermine (a) the ant\'s displacement and (b) the total distance traveled.\n2-2 Average Velocity\nAn important aspect of the motion of a moving object is how fast it is\nmoving-its speed or velocity.\nThe term "speed" refers to how far an object travels in a given time interval,\nregardless of direction. If a car travels 240 kilometers (km) in 3 hours (h), we say\nits average speed was 80 km/h. In general, the average speed of an object is\ndefined as the total distance traveled along its path divided by the time it takes to\ntravel this distance:\ndistance traveled\n.\naverage speed =\ntime elapsed\n(2-1)\nThe terms "velocity" and "speed" are often used interchangeably in ordi-\nnary language. But in physics we make a distinction between the two. Speed is\nsimply a positive number, with units. Velocity, on the other hand, is used to\nsignify both the magnitude (numerical value) of how fast an object is moving\nand also the direction in which it is moving. Velocity is therefore a vector.\nΔ.x = Χ2 - Χ1 = 10.0m -30.0m,\nthe displacement vector points left.\ny\nX2\nX\n4.x\n-\n-x\n0\n10\n20\n30 40\nDistance (m)\nSECTION 2-2 Average Velocity 23\n', 'chapter_title': 'Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CAUTION\nAverage speed is not necessarily\nequal to the magnitude of the\naverage velocity\nPROBLEM SOLVING\n+ or - sign can signify the direction\nfor linear motion\nCAUTION\nTime interval = elapsed time\nFIGURE 2-7 Example 2-1.\nA person runs from x1 = 50.0 m\nto x2 = 30.5 m.

In other cases, they may differ: recall the walk we\ndescribed earlier, in Fig. 2-4, where a person walked 70 m east and then 30 m west.\nThe total distance traveled was 70 m + 30 m = 100 m, but the displacement was\n40 m. Suppose this walk took 70 s to complete. Then the average speed was:\n= 1.4 m/s.\ntime elapsed\ndistance\n70 s\n100 m\nThe magnitude of the average velocity, on the other hand, was:\ndisplacement\n40 m\ntime elapsed\n70 s\n= 0.57 m/s.\nTo discuss one-dimensional motion of an object in general, suppose that at\nsome moment in time, call it t1, the object is on the x axis at position x1 in a\ncoordinate system, and at some later time, t2, suppose it is at position x2 . The\nelapsed time (= change in time) is At = t2 -t1; during this time interval the\ndisplacement of our object is Ax = x2 - x1. Then the average velocity,\ndefined as the displacement divided by the elapsed time, can be written\n[average velocity] (2-2)\nt2 - 41\nv = x2 - X1 = Ax\nAt\nwhere v stands for velocity and the bar (-) over the v is a standard symbol\nmeaning "average."\nFor one-dimensional motion in the usual case of the +x axis to the right,\nnote that if x2 is less than x1, the object is moving to the left, and then\nAx = x2 - X1 is less than zero. The sign of the displacement, and thus of the\naverage velocity, indicates the direction: the average velocity is positive for an\nobject moving to the right along the x axis and negative when the object\nmoves to the left. The direction of the average velocity is always the same as\nthe direction of the displacement.\nIt is always important to choose (and state) the elapsed time, or time interval,\nt2 -t1, the time that passes during our chosen period of observation.\nEXAMPLE 2-1\nRunner\'s average velocity. The position of a runner is\nplotted as moving along the x axis of a coordinate system. During a 3.00-s time\ninterval, the runner\'s position changes from x1 = 50.0m to x2 = 30.5 m, as\nshown in Fig. 2-7. What is the runner\'s average velocity?\nAPPROACH We want to find the average velocity, which is the displacement\ndivided by the elapsed time.\nAx = X2 - X1\n= 30.5 m - 50.0m = - 19.5 m.\nThe elapsed time, or time interval, is given as At = 3.00 s. The average velocity\n(Eq. 2-2) is\nv = AX = -\n-19.5 m\n=\n-6.50 m/s.\nAt\n3.00 s\nThe displacement and average velocity are negative, which tells us that the\nrunner is moving to the left along the x axis, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 2-7.\nThe runner\'s average velocity is 6.50 m/s to the left.\n24 CHAPTER 2 Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension\n', 'chapter_title': 'Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 2-2\nDistance a cyclist travels.

Can you see why? You must use the definition of v, Eq. 2-2.\n2-3 Instantaneous Velocity\nIf you drive a car along a straight road for 150 km in 2.0 h, the magnitude of\nyour average velocity is 75 km/h. It is unlikely, though, that you were moving\nat precisely 75 km/h at every instant. To describe this situation we need the\nconcept of instantaneous velocity, which is the velocity at any instant of time.\n(Its magnitude is the number, with units, indicated by a speedometer, Fig. 2-8.)\nMore precisely, the instantaneous velocity at any moment is defined as the\naverage velocity over an infinitesimally short time interval. That is, Eq. 2-2 is to be\nevaluated in the limit of At becoming extremely small, approaching zero. We can\nwrite the definition of instantaneous velocity, v, for one-dimensional motion as\nv = lim\n4.x\n[instantaneous velocity] (2-3)\n.\nAt ->0 At\n50 60\n80\n100\n40\n70\n12\n80\n140 90\n40\nThe notation limAt->0 means the ratio Ax/At is to be evaluated in the limit of\nAt approaching zero.+\nFor instantaneous velocity we use the symbol v, whereas for average\nvelocity we use v, with a bar above. In the rest of this book, when we use the\nterm "velocity" it will refer to instantaneous velocity. When we want to speak of\nthe average velocity, we will make this clear by including the word "average."\nNote that the instantaneous speed always equals the magnitude of the\ninstantaneous velocity. Why? Because distance traveled and the magnitude of\nthe displacement become the same when they become infinitesimally small.\nIf an object moves at a uniform (that is, constant) velocity during a partic-\nular time interval, then its instantaneous velocity at any instant is the same as its\naverage velocity (see Fig. 2-9a). But in many situations this is not the case. For\nexample, a car may start from rest, speed up to 50 km/h, remain at that velocity\nfor a time, then slow down to 20 km/h in a traffic jam, and finally stop at its\ndestination after traveling a total of 15 km in 30 min. This trip is plotted on the\ngraph of Fig. 2-9b.

(a) If the velocity\nof an object is zero, does it mean that the acceleration is zero? (b) If the\nacceleration is zero, does it mean that the velocity is zero? Think of some examples.\nRESPONSE A zero velocity does not necessarily mean that the acceleration\nis zero, nor does a zero acceleration mean that the velocity is zero. (a) For\nexample, when you put your foot on the gas pedal of your car which is at rest,\nthe velocity starts from zero but the acceleration is not zero since the velocity\nof the car changes. (How else could your car start forward if its velocity weren't\nchanging-that is, accelerating?) (b) As you cruise along a straight highway at\na constant velocity of 100 km/h, your acceleration is zero: a = 0, v ¥ 0.\nEXAMPLE 2-6\nCar slowing down. An automobile is moving to the right\nalong a straight highway, which we choose to be the positive x axis (Fig. 2-11).\nThen the driver steps on the brakes. If the initial velocity (when the driver hits\nthe brakes) is V1 = 15.0m/s, and it takes 5.0 s to slow down to 02 = 5.0 m/s,\nwhat was the car's average acceleration?\nAPPROACH We put the given initial and final velocities, and the elapsed\ntime, into Eq. 2-4 for a.\nSOLUTION In Eq. 2-4, we call the initial time t1 = 0, and set t2 = 5.0 s:\na =\n5.0 m/s - 15.0m/s\n= - 2.0 m/s2.\n5.0 s\nThe negative sign appears because the final velocity is less than the initial velocity.\nIn this case the direction of the acceleration is to the left (in the negative x direc-\ntion)-even though the velocity is always pointing to the right. We say that the\nacceleration is 2.0 m/s2 to the left, and it is shown in Fig. 2-11 as an orange arrow.\nDeceleration\nWhen an object is slowing down, we can say it is decelerating. But be careful:\ndeceleration does not mean that the acceleration is necessarily negative. The\nvelocity of an object moving to the right along the positive x axis is positive;\nif the object is slowing down (as in Fig. 2-11), the acceleration is negative. But\nthe same car moving to the left (decreasing x), and slowing down, has positive\nacceleration that points to the right, as shown in Fig. 2-12. We have a decelera-\ntion whenever the magnitude of the velocity is decreasing; thus the velocity\nand acceleration point in opposite directions when there is deceleration.\nEXERCISE C A car moves along the x axis.

In this case, the instantaneous and average accelerations are equal.\nWe use the definitions of average velocity and acceleration to derive a set of\nvaluable equations that relate x, v, a, and t when a is constant, allowing us to\ndetermine any one of these variables if we know the others. We can then solve\nmany interesting Problems.\nNotation in physics varies from book to book; and different instructors use\ndifferent notation.

First we choose the\ninitial time in any discussion to be zero, and we call it t 0 . That is, t1 = t 0 = 0.\n(This is effectively starting a stopwatch at t 0 . ) We can then let t 2 = t be the\nelapsed time.

At\ntime t the position and velocity will be called x and v (rather than x2 and v2).\nThe average velocity during the time interval t - to will be (Eq. 2-2)\nv = AX = x - X0 = "+\nx - x0\nt - t0\nsince we chose to = 0. The acceleration, assumed constant in time, is a = Av/At\n(Eq. 2-4), so\na = " T "\n0-00\nA common problem is to determine the velocity of an object after any elapsed\ntime t, when we are given the object\'s constant acceleration. We can solve such\nproblems+ by solving for v in the last equation: first we multiply both sides by t,\nat = v - Vo\nor\nv - Vo = at.\nThen, adding v0 to both sides, we obtain\nV = Vo + at.\n[constant acceleration] (2-6)\nIf an object, such as a motorcycle (Fig. 2-13), starts from rest (vo = 0) and\naccelerates at 4.0 m/s2, after an elapsed time t = 6.0s its velocity will be\nv= 0 + at = (4.0 m/s2) (6.0s) = 24 m/s.\nNext, let us see how to calculate the position x of an object after a time t when\nit undergoes constant acceleration. The definition of average velocity (Eq. 2-2)\nis v = (x - x0)/t, which we can rewrite by multiplying both sides by t:\nx = x0 + īt.\n(2-7)\nBecause the velocity increases at a uniform rate, the average velocity, v, will be\nmidway between the initial and final velocities:\nv = 00 + 0.\n[constant acceleration] (2-8)\n(Careful: Equation 2-8 is not necessarily valid if the acceleration is not constant.)\nWe combine the last two Equations with Eq. 2-6 and find, starting with Eq. 2-7,\nx = x0 + īt\n= x0 + (0 + 2)+\n2\n= X0 +\nVo + Vo + at\n2\nt\nor\nX = x0 + Vot + ¿at2.\n[constant acceleration] (2-9)\nEquations 2-6, 2-8, and 2-9 are three of the four most useful equations for\nmotion at constant acceleration.

Equations 2-11 are useful also when a is approximately constant\nto obtain reasonable estimates.\nEXAMPLE 2-7\nRunway design. You are designing an airport for small\nplanes.

First, it is important to note that physics is not a collection of equations to\nbe memorized. Simply searching for an equation that might work can lead you\nto a wrong result and will not help you understand physics (Fig. 2-14).\nA better approach is to use the following (rough) procedure, which we present as\na special "Problem Solving Strategy." (Other such Problem Solving Strategies\nwill be found throughout the book.)\nFIGURE 2-14 Read the book, study\ncarefully, and work the Problems using\nyour reasoning abilities.\n5\nING\nLEM\n1. Read and reread the whole problem carefully before\ntrying to solve it.\nROB,\n2. Decide what object (or objects) you are going to\nstudy, and for what time interval. You can often\nchoose the initial time to be t = 0.\nP\n3. Draw a diagram or picture of the situation, with\ncoordinate axes wherever applicable. [You can place\nthe origin of coordinates and the axes wherever you\nlike to make your calculations easier. You also choose\nwhich direction is positive and which is negative.\nUsually we choose the x axis to the right as positive.]\n4. Write down what quantities are "known" or "given,"\nand then what you want to know. Consider quan-\ntities both at the beginning and at the end of the\nchosen time interval. You may need to "translate"\nlanguage into physical terms, such as "starts from\nrest" means vo = 0.\n5. Think about which principles of physics apply in\nthis problem. Use common sense and your own\nexperiences. Then plan an approach.\n6. Consider which equations (and/or definitions) relate\nthe quantities involved. Before using them, be sure\ntheir range of validity includes your problem (for\nexample, Eqs. 2-11 are valid only when the accel-\neration is constant). If you find an applicable\nequation that involves only known quantities and\none desired unknown, solve the equation alge-\nbraically for the unknown. Sometimes several\nsequential calculations, or a combination of equa-\ntions, may be needed. It is often preferable to solve\nalgebraically for the desired unknown before\nputting in numerical values.\n7. Carry out the calculation if it is a numerical problem.\nKeep one or two extra digits during the calculations,\nbut round off the final answer(s) to the correct number\nof significant figures (Section 1-4).\n8. Think carefully about the result you obtain: Is it\nreasonable? Does it make sense according to your\nown intuition and experience? A good check is to\ndo a rough estimate using only powers of 10, as\ndiscussed in Section 1-7. Often it is preferable to\ndo a rough estimate at the start of a numerical\nproblem because it can help you focus your\nattention on finding a path toward a solution.\n9. A very important aspect of doing problems is keep-\ning track of units. An equals sign implies the units on\neach side must be the same, just as the numbers must.\nIf the units do not balance, a mistake has been\nmade. This can serve as a check on your solution\n(but it only tells you if you\'re wrong, not if you\'re\nright). Always use a consistent set of units.\n30 CHAPTER 2 Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension\n', 'chapter_title': 'Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 2-8\nAcceleration of a car.

Reread the problem. Be sure you understand what it asks for (here, a time\ninterval: "how long does it take").\n2. The object under study is the car. We need to choose the time interval\nduring which we look at the car\'s motion: we choose t = 0, the initial time,\nto be the moment the car starts to accelerate from rest (vo = 0); the time t\nis the instant the car has traveled the full 30.0-m width of the intersection.\n3. Draw a diagram: the situation is shown in Fig. 2-15, where the car is shown\nmoving along the positive x axis. We choose x0 = 0 at the front bumper of\nthe car before it starts to move.\n4. The "knowns" and the "wanted" information are shown in the Table in the\nmargin. Note that "starting from rest" means v = 0 at t = 0; that is, vo = 0.\nThe wanted time t is how long it takes the car to travel 30.0 m.\n5. The physics: the car, starting from rest (at to = 0), increases in speed as it\ncovers more distance. The acceleration is constant, so we can use the kine-\nmatic equations, Eqs. 2-11.\n6. Equations: we want to find the time, given the distance and acceleration;\nEq. 2-11b is perfect since the only unknown quantity is t.

Estimate the minimum\nstopping distance for a car, which is important for traffic safety and traffic design.\nThe problem is best dealt with in two parts, two separate time intervals. (1) The\nfirst time interval begins when the driver decides to hit the brakes, and ends\nwhen the foot touches the brake pedal. This is the "reaction time" during which\nthe speed is constant, so a = 0. (2) The second time interval is the actual\nbraking period when the vehicle slows down (a ¥ 0) and comes to a stop. The\nstopping distance depends on the reaction time of the driver, the initial speed of\nthe car (the final speed is zero), and the deceleration of the car. For a dry road\nand good tires, good brakes can decelerate a car at a rate of about 5 m/s2 to\n8 m/s2. Calculate the total stopping distance for an initial velocity of 50 km/h\n(= 14 m/s ~ 31 mi/h) and assume the acceleration of the car is -6.0 m/s2\n(the minus sign appears because the velocity is taken to be in the positive\nx direction and its magnitude is decreasing). Reaction time for normal drivers\nvaries from perhaps 0.3 s to about 1.0 s; take it to be 0.50 s.\nAPPROACH During the "reaction time," part (1), the car moves at constant\nspeed of 14 m/s, so a = 0. Once the brakes are applied, part (2), the acceler-\nation is a = - 6.0 m/s2 and is constant over this time interval. For both parts\na is constant, so we can use Eqs. 2-11.\nSOLUTION Part (1). We take x0 = 0 for the first time interval, when the driver\nis reacting (0.50 s): the car travels at a constant speed of 14 m/s so a = 0.\nSee Fig. 2-16 and the Table in the margin. To find x, the position of the car\nat t = 0.50 s (when the brakes are applied), we cannot use Eq. 2-11c because\nx is multiplied by a, which is zero. But Eq. 2-11b works:\nx= Vot + 0 = (14 m/s)(0.50 s) = 7.0 m.\nThus the car travels 7.0 m during the driver\'s reaction time, until the instant\nthe brakes are applied. We will use this result as input to part (2).\nPart (2). During the second time interval, the brakes are applied and the car is\nbrought to rest. The initial position is x0 = 7.0m (result of part (1)), and other\nvariables are shown in the second Table in the margin. Equation 2-11a doesn\'t\ncontain x; Eq. 2-11b contains x but also the unknown t. Equation 2-11c,\nv2 - v2 = 2a(x - x0), is what we want; after setting x0 = 7.0m, we solve\nfor x, the final position of the car (when it stops):\nx =\nxo +\n02 - 03\n2a\n-196 m2/s2\n= 7.0m +\n2(-6.0m/s2)\n0 - (14 m/s)2\n= 7.0m +\n-12 m/s2\n= 7.0m + 16m = 23 m.\nThe car traveled 7.0 m while the driver was reacting and another 16 m during\nthe braking period before coming to a stop, for a total distance traveled of\n23 m. Figure 2-17 shows a graph of v vs. t: v is constant from t = 0 until\nt = 0.50 s, and after t = 0.50 s it decreases linearly to zero.\nNOTE From the equation above for x, we see that the stopping distance after\nthe driver hit the brakes (= x - x0) increases with the square of the initial\nspeed, not just linearly with speed. If you are traveling twice as fast, it takes\nfour times the distance to stop.\n32 CHAPTER 2 Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension\n', 'chapter_title': 'Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 2-18 Painting of Galileo demonstrating to the Grand Duke of Tuscany\nhis argument for the action of gravity being uniform acceleration. He used an inclined\nplane to slow down the action. A ball rolling down the plane still accelerates.\nTiny bells placed at equal distances along the inclined plane would ring at shorter\ntime intervals as the ball "fell," indicating that the speed was increasing.\n2-7 Freely Falling Objects\nOne of the most common examples of uniformly accelerated motion is that of\nan object allowed to fall freely near the Earth\'s surface. That a falling object is\naccelerating may not be obvious at first. And beware of thinking, as was widely\nbelieved before the time of Galileo (Fig. 2-18), that heavier objects fall faster\nthan lighter objects and that the speed of fall is proportional to how heavy the\nobject is. The speed of a falling object is not proportional to its mass.\nGalileo made use of his new technique of imagining what would happen in\nidealized (simplified) cases. For free fall, he postulated that all objects would\nfall with the same constant acceleration in the absence of air or other resistance.\nHe showed that this postulate predicts that for an object falling from rest, the\ndistance traveled will be proportional to the square of the time (Fig. 2-19); that\nis, d ox t2. We can see this from Eq. 2-11b for constant acceleration; but Galileo\nwas the first to derive this mathematical relation.\nTo support his claim that falling objects increase in speed as they fall,\nGalileo made use of a clever argument: a heavy stone dropped from a height of\n2 m will drive a stake into the ground much further than will the same stone\ndropped from a height of only 0.2 m. Clearly, the stone must be moving faster\nin the former case.\nGalileo claimed that all objects, light or heavy, fall with the same accel-\neration, at least in the absence of air. If you hold a piece of paper flat and\nhorizontal in one hand, and a heavier object like a baseball in the other, and\nrelease them at the same time as in Fig. 2-20a, the heavier object will reach the\nground first. But if you repeat the experiment, this time crumpling the paper\ninto a small wad, you will find (see Fig. 2-20b) that the two objects reach the floor\nat nearly the same time.\nGalileo was sure that air acts as a resistance to very light objects that have\na large surface area. But in many ordinary circumstances this air resistance is\nnegligible. In a chamber from which the air has been removed, even light\nobjects like a feather or a horizontally held piece of paper will fall with the\nsame acceleration as any other object (see Fig. 2-21). Such a demonstration in\nvacuum was not possible in Galileo\'s time, which makes Galileo\'s achievement\nall the greater. Galileo is often called the "father of modern science," not only\nfor the content of his science (astronomical discoveries, inertia, free fall) but\nalso for his new methods of doing science (idealization and simplification, mathe-\nmatization of theory, theories that have testable consequences, experiments to test\ntheoretical predictions).\nFIGURE 2-19 Multiflash photograph\nof a falling apple, at equal time\nintervals.

Its magnitude is approximately\nacceleration due to gravity\nat surface of Earth\ng = 9.80 m/s2.\nIn British units g is about 32 ft/s2. Actually, g varies slightly according to lati-\ntude and elevation on the Earth\'s surface, but these variations are so small that\nwe will ignore them for most purposes. (Acceleration of gravity in space beyond\nthe Earth\'s surface is treated in Chapter 5.) The effects of air resistance are\noften small, and we will neglect them for the most part. However, air resistance\nwill be noticeable even on a reasonably heavy object if the velocity becomes\nlarge.+ Acceleration due to gravity is a vector, as is any acceleration, and its\ndirection is downward toward the center of the Earth.\nWhen dealing with freely falling objects we can make use of Eqs. 2-11,\nwhere for a we use the value of g given above. Also, since the motion is vertical\nwe will substitute y in place of x, and y0 in place of x0 . We take y0 = 0 unless\notherwise specified. It is arbitrary whether we choose y to be positive in the\nupward direction or in the downward direction; but we must be consistent about\nit throughout a problem\'s solution.\n-\nEXERCISE E Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 21, and answer it again\nnow, assuming minimal air resistance. Try to explain why you may have answered\ndifferently the first time.\nEXAMPLE 2-10\nFalling from a tower. Suppose that a ball is dropped\n(v 0 = 0) from a tower. How far will it have fallen after a time t 1 = 1.00 s,\nt2 = 2.00 s, and t3 = 3.00 s? Ignore air resistance.\nAPPROACH Let us take y as positive downward, so the acceleration is\na = g = +9.80 m/s2. We set Vo = 0 and yo = 0. We want to find the posi-\ntion y of the ball after three different time intervals. Equation 2-11b, with\nx replaced by y, relates the given quantities ( t, a, and v0 ) to the unknown y.\nSOLUTION We set t = t1 = 1.00s in Eq. 2-11b:\nyı = Voti + žať2\n= 0 + žať2 = $(9.80 m/s2)(1.00 s)2 = 4.90 m.\nThe ball has fallen a distance of 4.90 m during the time interval t = 0 to\nt1 = 1.00 s. Similarly, after 2.00 s (= t2), the ball\'s position is\ny2 = 2at2 = 2(9.80 m/s2)(2.00 s)2 = 19.6 m.\nFinally, after 3.00 s (= t3), the ball\'s position is (see Fig. 2-22)\n(a)\ny3 = 2at2 = $(9.80 m/s2)(3.00 s)2 = 44.1 m.\n40 -\n20 +\ny (m)\n30 +\n10 +\n(b)\n0\n1 2 3\nt (s)\nNOTE Whenever we say "dropped," it means vo = 0. Note also the graph of\ny vs. t (Fig. 2-22b): the curve is not straight but bends upward because y is\nproportional to t2.\n*The speed of an object falling in air (or other fluid) does not increase indefinitely. If the object falls\nfar enough, it will reach a maximum velocity called the terminal velocity due to air resistance.\n34 CHAPTER 2 Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension\n', 'chapter_title': 'Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 2-11\nThrown down from a tower.

Compare with the speeds\nof a dropped ball.\nAPPROACH Again we use Eq. 2-11b, but now vo is not zero, it is\nVo = 3.00 m/s.\nSOLUTION (a) At t1 = 1.00 s, the position of the ball as given by Eq. 2-11b is\ny = vot + 2at2 = (3.00 m/s)(1.00 s) + (9.80 m/s2)(1.00 s)2 = 7.90 m.\nAt t2 = 2.00 s (time interval t = 0 to t = 2.00 s), the position is\ny = Vot + 2at2 = (3.00 m/s) (2.00 s) + 2 (9.80 m/s2)(2.00 s)2 = 25.6 m.\nAs expected, the ball falls farther each second than if it were dropped with\nVo = 0.\n(b) The velocity is obtained from Eq. 2-11a:\nV = Vo + at\n= 3.00 m/s + (9.80 m/s2)(1.00 s) = 12.8 m/s [att1 = 1.00 s]\n= 3.00 m/s + (9.80 m/s2)(2.00 s) = 22.6 m/s.

Let us choose y to be positive in the\nupward direction and negative in the downward direction. (This is a different\nconvention from that used in Examples 2-10 and 2-11, and so illustrates our\noptions.) The acceleration due to gravity is downward and so will have a nega-\ntive sign, a = - g = - 9.80 m/s2. As the ball rises, its speed decreases until it\nreaches the highest point (B in Fig. 2-23), where its speed is zero for an\ninstant; then it descends, with increasing speed.\nSOLUTION We consider the time interval from when the ball leaves the\nthrower's hand until the ball reaches the highest point. To determine the\nmaximum height, we calculate the position of the ball when its velocity equals\nzero (v = 0 at the highest point). At t = 0 (point A in Fig. 2-23) we have\nyo= 0, 00 = 15.0m/s, and a = - 9.80 m/s2. At time t (maximum height),\nv= 0, a = - 9.80 m/s2, and we wish to find y. We use Eq. 2-11c, replacing x\nwith y: v2 = v3 + 2ay. We solve this equation for y:\nFIGURE 2-23 An object thrown\ninto the air leaves the thrower's\nhand at A, reaches its maximum\nheight at B, and returns to the\noriginal position at C.\nExamples 2-12, 2-13, 2-14, and 2-15.\nB(v=0)\n1\n00\ng\nv\nv\nA JU C\n02 - 0%\n=\n0 - (15.0 m/s)2\n= 11.5 m.\n2(-9.80 m/s2)\nThe ball reaches a height of 11.5 m above the hand.\nSECTION 2-7 Freely Falling Objects 35\n", 'chapter_title': 'Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'B(v=0)\ni\ng\ng\nv\nv\nI\nA JJ C\nFIGURE 2-23 (Repeated.)\nAn object thrown into the air leaves\nthe thrower\'s hand at A, reaches its\nmaximum height at B, and returns\nto the original position at C.\nExamples 2-12, 2-13, 2-14, and 2-15.\nCAUTION\nQuadratic equations have two\nsolutions.

In Fig. 2-23, Example 2-12, how\nlong is the ball in the air before it comes back to the hand?\nAPPROACH We need to choose a time interval to calculate how long the\nball is in the air before it returns to the hand. We could do this calculation\nin two parts by first determining the time required for the ball to reach its\nhighest point, and then determining the time it takes to fall back down.\nHowever, it is simpler to consider the time interval for the entire motion from\nA to B to C (Fig. 2-23) in one step and use Eq. 2-11b. We can do this because\ny is position or displacement, and not the total distance traveled. Thus, at both\npoints A and C, y = 0.\nSOLUTION We use Eq. 2-11b with a = - 9.80 m/s2 and find\ny = yo + Vot + zat2\n0 = 0 + (15.0m/s)t + 2(-9.80 m/s2) t2.\nThis equation can be factored (we factor out one t):\n(15.0m/s- 4.90m/s2 t)t = 0.\nThere are two solutions:\nt = 0 and t =\n4.90 m/s2\n15.0 m/s\n= 3.06 s.\nThe first solution (t = 0) corresponds to the initial point (A) in Fig. 2-23,\nwhen the ball was first thrown from y = 0. The second solution, t = 3.06 s,\ncorresponds to point C, when the ball has returned to y = 0. Thus the ball is\nin the air 3.06 s.\nNOTE We have ignored air resistance in these last two Examples, which could\nbe significant, so our result is only an approximation to a real, practical situation.\nWe did not consider the throwing action in these Examples. Why? Because during\nthe throw, the thrower\'s hand is touching the ball and accelerating the ball at a\nrate unknown to us-the acceleration is not g. We consider only the time when\nthe ball is in the air and the acceleration is equal to g.\nEvery quadratic equation (where the variable is squared) mathematically\nproduces two solutions. In physics, sometimes only one solution corresponds to\nthe real situation, as in Example 2-8, in which case we ignore the "unphysical"\nsolution. But in Example 2-13, both solutions to our equation in t2 are physi-\ncally meaningful: t = 0 and t = 3.06 s.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 2-14\nTwo possible misconceptions. Give\nexamples to show the error in these two common misconceptions: (1) that\nacceleration and velocity are always in the same direction, and (2) that\nan object thrown upward has zero acceleration at the highest point (B in\nFig. 2-23).\nRESPONSE Both are wrong. (1) Velocity and acceleration are not necessarily\nin the same direction. When the ball in Fig. 2-23 is moving upward, its\nvelocity is positive (upward), whereas the acceleration is negative (down-\nward). (2) At the highest point (B in Fig. 2-23), the ball has zero velocity for\nan instant. Is the acceleration also zero at this point? No. The velocity near\nthe top of the arc points upward, then becomes zero for an instant (zero time) at\nthe highest point, and then points downward. Gravity does not stop acting, so\na = - g = - 9.80 m/s2 even there. Thinking that a = 0 at point B would lead\nto the conclusion that upon reaching point B, the ball would stay there: if the\nacceleration ( = rate of change of velocity) were zero, the velocity would stay\nzero at the highest point, and the ball would stay up there without falling.\nRemember: the acceleration of gravity always points down toward the Earth, even\nwhen the object is moving up.\n36 CHAPTER 2 Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension\n', 'chapter_title': 'Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 2-15 | Ball thrown upward, III. Let us consider again the ball\nthrown upward of Examples 2-12 and 2-13, and make more calculations. Calculate\n(a) how much time it takes for the ball to reach the maximum height (point B in\nFig. 2-23), and (b) the velocity of the ball when it returns to the thrower's hand\n(point C).\nAPPROACH Again we assume the acceleration is constant, so we can use\nEqs. 2-11. We have the maximum height of 11.5 m and initial speed of 15.0 m/s\nfrom Example 2-12. Again we take y as positive upward.\nSOLUTION (a) We consider the time interval between the throw (t = 0,\nVo = 15.0 m/s) and the top of the path (y = +11.5 m, v = 0), and we want\nto find t. The acceleration is constant at a = - g = - 9.80 m/s2. Both\nEqs. 2-11a and 2-11b contain the time t with other quantities known. Let us\nuse Eq. 2-11a with a = - 9.80 m/s2, vo = 15.0 m/s, and v = 0:\nV = Vo + at;\nsetting v = 0 gives 0 = vo + at, which we rearrange to solve for t: at = - vo\nor\nt = - 00\n=\n–\n-9.80 m/s2\n15.0 m/s\n=\n1.53 s.\nThis is just half the time it takes the ball to go up and fall back to its original\nposition [3.06 s, calculated in Example 2-13]. Thus it takes the same time to\nreach the maximum height as to fall back to the starting point.\n(b) Now we consider the time interval from the throw (t = 0, 00 = 15.0m/s)\nuntil the ball's return to the hand, which occurs at t = 3.06 s (as calculated in\nExample 2-13), and we want to find v when t = 3.06 s:\nV = Vo + at\n= 15.0m/s - (9.80 m/s2)(3.06 s) = - 15.0 m/s.\nNOTE The ball has the same speed (magnitude of velocity) when it returns to\nthe starting point as it did initially, but in the opposite direction (this is the\nmeaning of the negative sign). And, as we saw in part (a), the time is the same\nup as down. Thus the motion is symmetrical about the maximum height.\nThe acceleration of objects such as rockets and fast airplanes is often given as\na multiple of g = 9.80 m/s2. For example, a plane pulling out of a dive\n(see Fig. 2-24) and undergoing 3.00 g's would have an acceleration of\n(3.00)(9.80 m/s2) = 29.4 m/s2.\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nAcceleration in g's\nFIGURE 2-24 Several planes, in\nformation, are just coming out of a\ndownward dive.\nSECTION 2-7 Freely Falling Objects 37\n", 'chapter_title': 'Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXERCISE F Two balls are thrown from a cliff.

To rise\nand fall back to the top of the cliff took 3.06 s (Example 2-13); so it took\nan additional 2.01 s to fall to the base. But what is the meaning of the other\nsolution, t = - 2.01 s? This is a time before the throw, when our calculation\nbegins, so it isn't relevant here. It is outside our chosen time interval, and so is\nan unphysical solution (also in Example 2-8).\n(b) From Example 2-12, the ball moves up 11.5 m, falls 11.5 m back down to\nthe top of the cliff, and then down another 50.0 m to the base of the cliff, for a\ntotal distance traveled of 73.0 m.

Our graph starts at x = 0, t = 0 (the origin). The graph of the\nposition increases linearly in time because, by Eq. 2-2, Ax = ~ At and ~ is a\nconstant. So the graph of x vs. t is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 2-26. The\nsmall (shaded) triangle on the graph indicates the slope of the straight line:\n50 +\n40 +\nAx=\n11 m\n30 +\n! At =\n1.0 s\nPosition, x (m)\nslope = Ax\nAt\nWe see, using the definition of average velocity (Eq. 2-2), that the slope of the\nx vs. t graph is equal to the velocity. And, as can be seen from the small triangle\non the graph, Ax/At = (11 m)/(1.0s) = 11 m/s, which is the given velocity.\nIf the object\'s velocity changes in time, we might have an x vs. t graph like\nthat shown in Fig. 2-27. (Note that this graph is different from showing the\n"path" of an object on an x vs. y plot.) Suppose the object is at position x1\nat time t1, and at position x2 at time t2. P1 and P2 represent these two points on\nthe graph. A straight line drawn from point P1 (x1, t1) to point P2(x2, t2)\nforms the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose sides are Ax and At. The\nratio Ax/At is the slope of the straight line PIP2. But Ax/At is also the\naverage velocity of the object during the time interval At = t2 - t1. Therefore,\nwe conclude that the average velocity of an object during any time interval\nAt = t2 - t1 is equal to the slope of the straight line (or chord) connecting the two\npoints (x1, t1) and (x2, t2) on an x vs. t graph.\nConsider now a time intermediate between t1 and t2, call it t3, at which moment\nthe object is at x3 (Fig. 2-28).

The slope of the line tangent\nto the curve at point P1 equals the\ninstantaneous velocity at time t1 .\nt\n0\nt1\nt3 t2\nNext let us take point P3 in Fig. 2-28 to be closer and closer to point P1 .\nThat is, we let the interval t3 - t1, which we now call At, to become smaller and\nsmaller. The slope of the line connecting the two points becomes closer and\ncloser to the slope of a line tangent to the curve at point P1. The average\nvelocity (equal to the slope of the chord) thus approaches the slope of\nthe tangent at point P1 . The definition of the instantaneous velocity (Eq. 2-3) is\nthe limiting value of the average velocity as At approaches zero. Thus the\ninstantaneous velocity equals the slope of the tangent to the curve of x vs. t at any\nchosen point (which we can simply call "the slope of the curve" at that point).\n+The tangent is a straight line that touches the curve only at the one chosen point, without passing\nacross or through the curve at that point.\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nVelocity equals slope of\nx vs. t graph at any instant\nSECTION 2-8 Graphical Analysis of Linear Motion 39\n', 'chapter_title': 'Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': "x\nP4\nP2\nP5\nX2\nFIGURE 2-29 Same x vs. t curve as in\nFigs. 2-27 and 2-28, but here showing the slope\nat four different points: At P4, the slope is zero,\nso v = 0.

For times after t2, the slope begins to decrease and reaches zero (v = 0)\nwhere x has its maximum value, at point P4 in Fig. 2-29. Beyond point P4, the\nslope is negative, as for point P5. The velocity is therefore negative, which\nmakes sense since x is now decreasing-the particle is moving toward decreasing\nvalues of x, to the left on a standard xy plot.\nSlope and Acceleration\nWe can also draw a graph of the velocity, v, vs. time, t, as shown in Fig. 2-30. Then the\naverage acceleration over a time interval At = t2 - t1 is represented by the slope\nof the straight line connecting the two points P1 and P2 as shown. [Compare this to\nthe position vs. time graph of Fig. 2-27 for which the slope of the straight line\nrepresents the average velocity.] The instantaneous acceleration at any time, say t1 ,\nis the slope of the tangent to the v vs. t curve at that time, which is also shown in\nFig. 2-30. Using this fact for the situation graphed in Fig. 2-30, as we go from\ntime t1 to time t2 the velocity continually increases, but the acceleration (the rate at\nwhich the velocity changes) is decreasing since the slope of the curve is decreasing.\n0\nt1\nt2\nt\nFIGURE 2-31 (below) Example 2-17.\n100\nCar A\nCar B\nv (km/h)\n+\n+ t (s)\n0\n-\n2 4 6 8\n10\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 2-17\nAnalyzing with graphs.

Both cars have the same\nAv (100 km/h) over the same time interval At = 10.0 s, so the average acceleration\nis the same for both cars. (b) Instantaneous acceleration is the slope of the tangent\nto the v vs. t curve.

The\nbottom curve is steeper during the last 6 s, so car B has the larger acceleration\nfor this period. (c) Except at t = 0 and t = 10.0s, car A is always going\nfaster than car B.

Agent Bond is standing on a bridge, 15 m above the road\nbelow, and his pursuers are getting too close for comfort.\nHe spots a flatbed truck approaching at 25 m/s, which he\nmeasures by knowing that the telephone poles the truck is\npassing are 25 m apart in this region. The roof of the truck\nis 3.5 m above the road, and Bond quickly calculates how\nmany poles away the truck should be when he drops down\nfrom the bridge onto the truck, making his getaway. How\nmany poles is it?\n70. A conveyor belt is used to send burgers through a grill-\ning machine. If the grilling machine is 1.2 m long and\nthe burgers require 2.8 min to cook, how fast must\nthe conveyor belt travel? If the burgers are spaced 25 cm\napart, what is the rate of burger production (in burgers/min)?\n71. Two students are asked to find the height of a particular\nbuilding using a barometer. Instead of using the barometer\nas an altitude measuring device, they take it to the roof of the\nbuilding and drop it off, timing its fall. One student reports a\nfall time of 2.0 s, and the other, 2.3 s. What % difference does\nthe 0.3 s make for the estimates of the building's height?\nGeneral Problems 47\n", 'chapter_title': 'Describing Motion: Kinematics in One Dimension'}, {'page_number': 28, 'type': 'text', 'content': "72. Two children are playing on two trampolines. The first\nchild bounces up one-and-a-half times higher than the\nsecond child. The initial speed up of the second child is\n4.0 m/s.

If there were no air resistance, how long would it take a\nfree-falling skydiver to fall from a plane at 3200 m to an\naltitude of 450 m, where she will open her parachute? What\nwould her speed be at 450 m? (In reality, the air resis-\ntance will restrict her speed to perhaps 150 km/h.)\n74. You stand at the top of a cliff while your friend stands on\nthe ground below you. You drop a ball from rest and see\nthat she catches it 1.4 s later. Your friend then throws the\nball up to you, such that it just comes to rest in your hand.\nWhat is the speed with which your friend threw the ball?\nSearch and Learn\n1. Discuss two conditions given in Section 2-7 for being able\nto use a constant acceleration of magnitude g = 9.8 m/s2.\nGive an example in which one of these conditions would\nnot be met and would not even be a reasonable approxima-\ntion of motion.\n2. In a lecture demonstration, a 3.0-m-long vertical string\nwith ten bolts tied to it at equal intervals is dropped from\nthe ceiling of the lecture hall. The string falls on a tin\nplate, and the class hears the clink of each bolt as it hits\nthe plate. (a) The sounds will not occur at equal time inter-\nvals. Why? (b) Will the time between clinks increase or\ndecrease as the string falls? (c) How could the bolts be tied\nso that the clinks occur at equal intervals? (Assume the\nstring is vertical with the bottom bolt touching the tin plate\nwhen the string is released.)\n75. On an audio compact disc (CD), digital bits of infor-\nmation are encoded sequentially along a spiral path. Each\nbit occupies about 0.28 um. A CD player's readout laser\nscans along the spiral's sequence of bits at a constant\nspeed of about 1.2 m/s as the CD spins. (a) Determine\nthe number N of digital bits that a CD player reads every\nsecond. (b) The audio information is sent to each of the\ntwo loudspeakers 44,100 times per second. Each of these\nsamplings requires 16 bits, and so you might expect the\nrequired bit rate for a CD player to be\nNo = 2(44,100\nsamplings\ns\nDes ) (16\nbits\n= 1.4×106\nbits\n,\nsampling\ns\nwhere the 2 is for the 2 loudspeakers (the 2 stereo channels).\nNote that N0 is less than the number N of bits actually\nread per second by a CD player. The excess number of\nbits (= N - No) is needed for encoding and error-\ncorrection. What percentage of the bits on a CD are\ndedicated to encoding and error-correction?\n3.
