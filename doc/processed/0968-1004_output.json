These two extreme realms, elementary particles and the cosmos,\nare among the most intriguing and exciting subjects in science. And, surprisingly,\nthese two extreme realms are related in a fundamental way, as was already hinted\nin Chapter 32.\nThis Hubble eXtreme Deep Field\n(XDF) photograph is of a very small\npart of the sky.

In (b) the view is toward\nthe center of the Galaxy (taken in\nsummer from Arizona).\nUse of the techniques and ideas of physics to study the night sky is often\nreferred to as astrophysics. Central to our present theoretical understanding of\nthe universe (or cosmos) is Einstein\'s general theory of relativity which represents\nour most complete understanding of gravitation. Many other aspects of physics\nare involved, from electromagnetism and thermodynamics to atomic and nuclear\nphysics as well as elementary particles. General Relativity serves also as the\nfoundation for modern cosmology, which is the study of the universe as a whole.\nCosmology deals especially with the search for a theoretical framework to under-\nstand the observed universe, its origin, and its future. The questions posed by\ncosmology are profound and difficult; the possible answers stretch the imagina-\ntion. They are questions like "Has the universe always existed, or did it have\na beginning in time?" Either alternative is difficult to imagine: time going back\nindefinitely into the past, or an actual moment when the universe began (but,\nthen, what was there before?). And what about the size of the universe? Is it\ninfinite in size? It is hard to imagine infinity. Or is it finite in size? This is also\nhard to imagine, for if the universe is finite, it does not make sense to ask what is\nbeyond it, because the universe is all there is.\nIn the last 10 to 20 years, so much progress has occurred in astrophysics and\ncosmology that many scientists are calling recent work a "Golden Age" for\ncosmology. Our survey will be qualitative, but we will nonetheless touch on the\nmajor ideas. We begin with a look at what can be seen beyond the Earth.\n33-1 Stars and Galaxies\nAccording to the ancients, the stars, except for the few that seemed to move\nrelative to the others (the planets), were fixed on a sphere beyond the last planet.\nThe universe was neatly self-contained, and we on Earth were at or near its\ncenter. But in the centuries following Galileo\'s first telescopic observations of the\nnight sky in 1609, our view of the universe has changed dramatically. We no\nlonger place ourselves at the center, and we view the universe as vastly larger.\nThe distances involved are so great that we specify them in terms of the time\nit takes light to travel the given distance: for example,\n1 light-second = (3.0×108m/s)(1.0s) = 3.0 ×108m = 300,000 km;\n1 light-minute = (3.0×108m/s)(60s) = 18 × 106 km.\nThe most common unit is the light-year (ly):\n1 ly = (2.998 × 108 m/s)(3.156 × 107 s/yr)\n(a)\n= 9.46 ×1015 m ~ 1013km ~ 1016 m.\nFor specifying distances to the Sun and Moon, we usually use meters or kilo-\nmeters, but we could specify them in terms of light seconds or minutes. The\nEarth-Moon distance is 384,000 km, which is 1.28 light-seconds. The Earth-Sun\ndistance is 1.50 × 1011 m, or 150,000,000 km; this is equal to 8.3 light-minutes (it\ntakes 8.3 min for light emitted by the Sun to reach us). Far out in our solar system,\nPluto is about 6 × 109 km from the Sun, or 6 × 10-4 ly.+ The nearest star to us,\nother than the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, about 4.2 ly away.\nOn a clear moonless night, thousands of stars of varying degrees of brightness\ncan be seen, as well as the long cloudy stripe known as the Milky Way (Fig. 33-1).\nGalileo first observed, with his telescope, that the Milky Way is comprised of\ncountless individual stars. A century and a half later (about 1750), Thomas\nWright suggested that the Milky Way was a flat disk of stars extending to great\ndistances in a plane, which we call the Galaxy (Greek for "milky way").\n+We can also say this is about 5 light-hours.\n(b)\n948 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Our Galaxy has a diameter of almost 100,000 light-years and a thickness of\nroughly 2000 ly. It has a central bulge and spiral arms (Fig. 33-2). Our Sun, which\nis a star like many others, is located about halfway from the galactic center to the\nedge, some 26,000 ly from the center. Our Galaxy contains roughly 400 billion\n(4 × 1011) stars. The Sun orbits the galactic center approximately once every\n250 million years, so its speed is roughly 200 km/s relative to the center of the\nGalaxy. The total mass of all the stars in our Galaxy is estimated to be about\n4 × 1041 kg of ordinary matter. There is also strong evidence that our Galaxy is perme-\nated and surrounded by a massive invisible "halo" of "dark matter" (Section 33-9).\nFIGURE 33-2 Our Galaxy, as it would appear from the\noutside: (a) "edge view," in the plane of the disk; (b) "top view,"\nlooking down on the disk.

We\nthen apply Newton\'s second law, F = ma, with a being the centripetal accelera-\ntion, a = v2/r, and for F we use the universal law of gravitation (Chapter 5).\nSOLUTION Our Sun and solar system orbit the center of the Galaxy, according to\nthe best measurements as mentioned above, with a speed of about v = 200 km/s\nat a distance from the Galaxy center of about r = 26,000 ly.

A few of these, such as those in the constellations\nAndromeda and Orion, can actually be discerned with the naked eye on a clear\nnight. Some are star clusters (Fig. 33-3), groups of stars that are so numerous\nthey appear to be a cloud. Others are glowing clouds of gas or dust (Fig. 33-4),\nand it is for these that we now mainly reserve the word nebula.\nMost fascinating are those that belong to a third category: they often have\nfairly regular elliptical shapes. Immanuel Kant (about 1755) guessed they are faint\nbecause they are a great distance beyond our Galaxy. At first it was not universally\naccepted that these objects were extragalactic-that is, outside our Galaxy. But\nthe very large telescopes constructed in the twentieth century revealed that\nindividual stars could be resolved within these extragalactic objects and that many\ncontain spiral arms. Edwin Hubble (1889-1953) did much of this observational\nwork in the 1920s using the 2.5-m (100-inch) telescope+ on Mt. Wilson near\nLos Angeles, California, then the world\'s largest. Hubble demonstrated that these\nobjects were indeed extragalactic because of their great distances. The distance\nto our nearest large galaxy,* Andromeda, is over 2 million light-years, a distance\n20 times greater than the diameter of our Galaxy. It seemed logical that these\nnebulae must be galaxies similar to ours. (Note that it is usual to capitalize the\nword "galaxy" only when it refers to our own.) Today it is thought there are roughly\n1011 galaxies in the observable universe-that is, roughly as many galaxies as there\nare stars in a galaxy. See Fig. 33-5.\nMany galaxies tend to be grouped in galaxy clusters held together by their\nmutual gravitational attraction. There may be anywhere from a few dozen to\nmany thousands of galaxies in each cluster. Furthermore, clusters themselves\nseem to be organized into even larger aggregates: clusters of clusters of galaxies,\nor superclusters. The farthest detectable galaxies are more than 1010 ly distant.\nSee Table 33-1 (top of next page).\n+2.5 m (= 100 inches) refers to the diameter of the curved objective mirror. The bigger the mirror, the\nmore light it collects (greater brightness) and the less diffraction there is (better resolution), so more and\nfainter stars can be seen. See Chapter 25. Until recently, photographic films or plates were used to take\nlong time exposures. Now large solid-state CCD or CMOS sensors (Section 25-1) are available con-\ntaining hundreds of millions of pixels (compared to 10 million pixels in a good-quality digital camera).\n*The Magellanic clouds are much closer than Andromeda, but are small and are usually considered\nsmall satellite galaxies of our own Galaxy.\nFIGURE 33-5 Photographs of galaxies.

Astronomers often\nthink of their telescopes as time machines, looking back toward the origin of the\nuniverse. How far back do they look?\nRESPONSE The distance in light-years measures how long in years the light\nhas been traveling to reach us, so Table 33-1 tells us also how far back in time\nwe are looking. For example, if we saw Proxima Centauri explode into a super-\nnova today, then the event would have really occurred about 4.2 years ago. The\nmost distant galaxies emitted the light we see now roughly 13 × 109 years ago.\nWhat we see was how they were then, 13 × 109 yr ago.\nEXERCISE A Suppose we could place a huge mirror 1 light-year away from us. What\nwould we see in this mirror if it is facing us on Earth? When did what we see in the\nmirror take place? (This might be called a "time machine.")\nBesides the usual stars, clusters of stars, galaxies, and clusters and super-\nclusters of galaxies, the universe contains many other interesting objects. Among\nthese are stars known as red giants, white dwarfs, neutron stars, exploding stars\ncalled novae and supernovae, and black holes whose gravity is so strong that even\nlight cannot escape them. In addition, there is electromagnetic radiation that\nreaches the Earth but does not come from the bright pointlike objects we call stars:\nparticularly important is the microwave background radiation that arrives nearly\nuniformly from all directions in the universe.\nTable 33-1 Astronomical\nDistances\nObject\nApprox.

The most dramatic examples\nof AGN are quasars ("quasistellar objects" or QSOs), which are so luminous that\nthe surrounding starlight of the galaxy is drowned out. Their luminosity is\nthought to come from matter falling into a giant black hole at a galaxy\'s center.\n33-2 Stellar Evolution: Birth and\nDeath of Stars, Nucleosynthesis\nThe stars appear unchanging. Night after night the night sky reveals no significant\nvariations. Indeed, on a human time scale, the vast majority of stars change very\nlittle (except for novae, supernovae, and certain variable stars). Although stars\nseem fixed in relation to each other, many move sufficiently for the motion to be\ndetected. Speeds of stars relative to neighboring stars can be hundreds of km/s,\nbut at their great distance from us, this motion is detectable only by careful\nmeasurement. There is also a great range of brightness among stars, due to\ndifferences in the rate stars emit energy and to their different distances from us.\nLuminosity and Brightness of Stars\nAny star or galaxy has an intrinsic luminosity, L (or simply luminosity), which is its\ntotal power radiated in watts. Also important is the apparent brightness, b, defined\nas the power crossing unit area at the Earth perpendicular to the path of the light.\nGiven that energy is conserved, and ignoring any absorption in space, the total\nemitted power L when it reaches a distance d from the star will be spread over a\nsphere of surface area 4mrd2. If d is the distance from the star to the Earth, then\nL must be equal to 4mrd2 times b (power per unit area at Earth). That is,\nL\n4Tr d2\nb\n=\n.\n(33-1)\nEXAMPLE 33-3\nApparent brightness. Suppose a star has luminosity equal\nto that of our Sun. If it is 10 ly away from Earth, how much dimmer will it appear?\nAPPROACH We use the inverse square law in Eq. 33-1 to determine the relative\nbrightness (b x 1/d2) since the luminosity L is the same for both stars.\nSOLUTION Using the inverse square law, the star appears dimmer by a factor\nbstar\n=\nd\'sun\n=\n(1.5 × 108 km)2\nbsun\nd\'star\n(10 ly)2(1013 km/ly)2\n~ 2 × 10-12.\nSECTION 33-2 951\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Careful study of nearby stars has shown that the luminosity for most stars\ndepends on the mass: the more massive the star, the greater its luminosityt.\nAnother important parameter of a star is its surface temperature, which can be\ndetermined from the spectrum of electromagnetic frequencies it emits. As we\nsaw in Chapter 27, as the temperature of a body increases, the spectrum shifts\nfrom predominantly lower frequencies (and longer wavelengths, such as red) to\nhigher frequencies (and shorter wavelengths such as blue). Quantitatively, the\nrelation is given by Wien\'s law (Eq. 27-2): the wavelength Ap at the peak of the\nspectrum of light emitted by a blackbody (we often approximate stars as\nblackbodies) is inversely proportional to its Kelvin temperature T; that is,\nÀpT= 2.90 × 10-3 m . K. The surface temperatures of stars typically range from\nabout 3000 K (reddish) to about 50,000 K (UV).\nEXAMPLE 33-4\nDetermining star temperature and star size. Suppose\nthat the distances from Earth to two nearby stars can be reasonably estimated, and\nthat their measured apparent brightnesses suggest the two stars have about the\nsame luminosity, L. The spectrum of one of the stars peaks at about 700 nm (so\nit is reddish). The spectrum of the other peaks at about 350 nm (bluish). Use\nWien\'s law (Eq. 27-2) and the Stefan-Boltzmann equation (Section 14-8) to\ndetermine (a) the surface temperature of each star, and (b) how much larger one\nstar is than the other.\nAPPROACH We determine the surface temperature T for each star using Wien\'s\nlaw and each star\'s peak wavelength. Then, using the Stefan-Boltzmann equation\n(power output or luminosity « AT4 where A = surface area of emitter), we can\nfind the surface area ratio and relative sizes of the two stars.\nSOLUTION (a) Wien\'s law (Eq. 27-2) states that ÀpT = 2.90 × 10-3 m·K. So\nthe temperature of the reddish star is\nT, =\n2.90 × 10-3 m ·K\n=\n2.90 × 10-3 m · K\n= 4140 K.\nλρ\n700 × 10-9m\nThe temperature of the bluish star will be double this because its peak wavelength\nis half (350 nm vs. 700 nm):\nTp = 8280 K.\n(b) The Stefan-Boltzmann equation, Eq. 14-6, states that the power radiated\nper unit area of surface from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of\nthe Kelvin temperature, T4. The temperature of the bluish star is double that of\nthe reddish star, so the bluish one must radiate (Tb/T1)4 = 24 = 16 times as\nmuch energy per unit area. But we are given that they have the same luminosity\n(the same total power output); so the surface area of the blue star must be 16\nthat of the red one. The surface area of a sphere is 4Tr2, so the radius of the\nreddish star is V16 = 4 times larger than the radius of the bluish star (or 43 = 64\ntimes the volume).\nH-R Diagram\nAn important astronomical discovery, made around 1900, was that for most stars,\nthe color is related to the intrinsic luminosity and therefore to the mass. A useful\nway to present this relationship is by the so-called Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R)\ndiagram. On the H-R diagram, the horizontal axis shows the surface tempera-\nture T and the vertical axis is the luminosity L; each star is represented by a point\n*Applies to "main-sequence" stars (see next page). The mass of a star can be determined by observing\nits gravitational effects on other visible objects. Many stars are part of a cluster, the simplest being\na binary star in which two stars orbit around each other, allowing their masses to be determined using\nrotational mechanics.\n952 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': "1029\n1028\nOur Sun\n1027\nRed\ngiants\nIntrinsic luminosity L (watts)\n1026\nMain sequence\n1025\n1024\nWhite dwarfs. ..\n1023\n10,000\n7000\n5000\n3500\nSurface temperature T (K)\nFIGURE 33-6 Hertzsprung-Russell\n(H-R) diagram is a logarithmic\ngraph of luminosity vs. surface\ntemperature T of stars (note that T\nincreases to the left).\non the diagram, Fig. 33-6.

Were they all born this way, in the beginning? Or might\neach different type represent a different age in the life cycle of a star? Astronomers\nand astrophysicists today believe the latter is the case. Note, however, that we\ncannot actually follow any but the tiniest part of the life cycle of any given star\nbecause they live for ages vastly greater than ours, on the order of millions or\nbillions of years. Nonetheless, let us follow the process of stellar evolution from\nthe birth to the death of a star, as astrophysicists have theoretically reconstructed\nit today.\nStars are born, it is believed, when gaseous clouds (mostly hydrogen) contract\ndue to the pull of gravity. A huge gas cloud might fragment into numerous con-\ntracting masses, each mass centered in an area where the density is only slightly\ngreater than that at nearby points. Once such "globules" form, gravity causes\neach to contract in toward its center of mass. As the particles of such a protostar\naccelerate inward, their kinetic energy increases. Eventually, when the kinetic\nenergy is sufficiently high, the Coulomb repulsion between the positive charges\nis not strong enough to keep all the hydrogen nuclei apart, and nuclear fusion can\ntake place.\nIn a star like our Sun, the fusion of hydrogen (sometimes referred to as\n"burning")* occurs via the proton-proton chain (Section 31-3, Eqs. 31-6), in which\nfour protons fuse to form a 4He nucleus with the release of Y rays, positrons,\nand neutrinos: 41H -> 4He + 2 e+ + 2ve + 2Y. These reactions require a tem-\nperature of about 107 K, corresponding to an average kinetic energy (~ kT) of\nabout 1 keV (Eq. 13-8). In more massive stars, the carbon cycle produces the\nsame net effect: four 1H produce a 4He-see Section 31-3. The fusion reactions\ntake place primarily in the core of a star, where T may be on the order of 107 to\n108 K. (The surface temperature is much lower-on the order of a few thousand\nkelvins.) The tremendous release of energy in these fusion reactions produces\nan outward pressure sufficient to halt the inward gravitational contraction. Our\nprotostar, now really a young star, stabilizes on the main sequence. Exactly where\nthe star falls along the main sequence depends on its mass. The more massive the\nstar, the farther up (and to the left) it falls on the H-R diagram of Fig. 33-6.\nOur Sun required perhaps 30 million years to reach the main sequence, and is\nexpected to remain there about 10 billion years (1010 yr). Although most stars are\nbillions of years old, evidence is strong that stars are actually being born at this\nmoment. More massive stars have shorter lives, because they are hotter and the\nCoulomb repulsion is more easily overcome, so they use up their fuel faster.\nOur Sun may remain on the main sequence for 1010 years, but a star ten times\nmore massive may reside there for only 107 years.\nAs hydrogen fuses to form helium, the helium that is formed is denser and\ntends to accumulate in the central core where it was formed. As the core of\nhelium grows, hydrogen continues to fuse in a shell around it: see Fig. 33-7.\nWhen much of the hydrogen within the core has been consumed, the production\nof energy decreases at the center and is no longer sufficient to prevent the huge\ngravitational forces from once again causing the core to contract and heat up.\nThe hydrogen in the shell around the core then fuses even more fiercely because\nof this rise in temperature, allowing the outer envelope of the star to expand and\nto cool.

As it moves upward, it enters the red giant\nstage. Thus, theory explains the origin of red giants as a natural step in a star\'s\nevolution. Our Sun, for example, has been on the main sequence for about\n42 billion years. It will probably remain there another 5 or 6 billion years. When\nour Sun leaves the main sequence, it is expected to grow in diameter (as it\nbecomes a red giant) by a factor of 100 or more, possibly swallowing up inner\nplanets such as Mercury and possibly Venus and even Earth.\nRed\ngiant\nHorizontal\nbranch\nIf the star is like our Sun, or larger, further fusion can occur. As the star\'s\nouter envelope expands, its core continues to shrink and heat up. When the\ntemperature reaches about 108 K, even helium nuclei, in spite of their greater\ncharge and hence greater electrical repulsion, can come close enough to each\nother to undergo fusion.

Further fusion reactions\nare possible, with 4He fusing with 12C to form 160. In more massive stars, higher Z\nelements like 20Ne or 24Mg can be made. This process of creating heavier nuclei\nfrom lighter ones (or by absorption of neutrons which tends to occur at higher Z)\nis called nucleosynthesis.\nLow Mass Stars-White Dwarfs\nThe final fate of a star depends on its mass. Stars can lose mass as parts of their\nouter envelope move off into space. Stars born with a mass less than about\n8 solar masses (8X the mass of our Sun) eventually end up with a residual mass\nless than about 1.4 solar masses. A residual mass of 1.4 solar masses is known as\nthe Chandrasekhar limit. For stars smaller than this, no further fusion energy can\nbe obtained because of the large Coulomb repulsion between nuclei. The core\nof such a "low mass" star (original mass ≤ 8 solar masses) contracts under\ngravity. The outer envelope expands again and the star becomes an even\nbrighter and larger red giant, Fig. 33-8. Eventually the outer layers escape into\nspace, and the newly revealed surface is hotter than before. So the star moves to\nthe left in the H-R diagram (horizontal dashed line in Fig. 33-8). Then, as the\ncore shrinks the star cools, and typically follows the downward dashed route\nshown on the left in Fig. 33-8, becoming a white dwarf. A white dwarf with\na residual mass equal to that of the Sun would be about the size of the Earth.\nA white dwarf contracts to the point at which the electrons start to overlap, but\nno further because, by the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can be in\nthe same quantum state. At this point the star is supported against further\ncollapse by this electron degeneracy pressure. A white dwarf continues to lose\ninternal energy by radiation, decreasing in temperature and becoming dimmer\nuntil it glows no more. It has then become a cold dark chunk of extremely dense\nmaterial.\nHigh Mass Stars-Supernovae, Neutron Stars, Black Holes\nStars whose original mass is greater than about 8 solar masses are thought to\nfollow a very different scenario. A star with this great a mass can contract under\ngravity and heat up even further. At temperatures T ~ 3 or 4 × 109 K, nuclei as\nheavy as 56Fe and 56Ni can be made. But here the formation of heavy nuclei from\nlighter ones, by fusion, ends. As we saw in Fig. 30-1, the average binding energy\nper nucleon begins to decrease for A greater than about 60. Further fusions\nwould require energy, rather than release it.\nSECTION 33-2 Stellar Evolution: Birth and Death of Stars, Nucleosynthesis 955\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': '(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 33-9 The star indicated by\nthe arrow in (a) exploded in 1987 as\na supernova (SN1987A), as shown\nin (b).

This then can force electrons\nand protons together to form neutrons in inverse ß decay:\ne" + p -> n + v.\nAs a result of these reactions, the pressure in the core drops precipitously. As the\ncore collapses under the huge gravitational forces, the tremendous mass becomes\nessentially an enormous nucleus made up almost exclusively of neutrons. The\nsize of the star is no longer limited by the exclusion principle applied to electrons,\nbut rather by neutron degeneracy pressure, and the star contracts rapidly to form\nan enormously dense neutron star. The core of a neutron star contracts to the\npoint at which all neutrons are as close together as they are in an atomic nucleus.\nThat is, the density of a neutron star is on the order of 1014 times greater than\nnormal solids and liquids on Earth. A cupful of such dense matter would weigh\nbillions of tons. A neutron star that has a mass 1.5 times that of our Sun would\nhave a diameter of only about 20 km. (Compare this to a white dwarf with 1 solar\nmass whose diameter would be ~ 104 km, as mentioned on the previous page.)\nThe contraction of the core of a massive star would mean a great reduction in\ngravitational potential energy. Somehow this energy would have to be released.\nIndeed, it was suggested in the 1930s that the final core collapse to a neutron star\ncould be accompanied by a catastrophic explosion known as a supernova (plural =\nsupernovae). The tremendous energy release (Fig. 33-9) could form virtually all\nelements of the Periodic Table (see below) and blow away the entire outer\nenvelope of the star, spreading its contents into interstellar space. The presence\nof heavy elements on Earth and in our solar system suggests that our solar system\nformed from the debris of many such supernova explosions.\nThe elements heavier than Ni are thought to form mainly by neutron capture\nin these exploding supernovae (rather than by fusion, as for elements up to Ni).\nLarge numbers of free neutrons, resulting from nuclear reactions, are present\ninside those highly evolved stars and they can readily combine with, say, a 2Fe\nnucleus to form (if three are captured) 28Fe, which decays to 29Co. The 29Co can\ncapture neutrons, also becoming neutron rich and decaying by B" to the next\nhigher Z element, and so on to the highest Z elements.\nThe final state of a neutron star depends on its mass. If the final mass is less\nthan about three solar masses, the subsequent evolution of the neutron star is\nthought to resemble that of a white dwarf. If the mass is greater than this\n(original mass ≥40 solar masses), the neutron star collapses under gravity,\novercoming even neutron degeneracy. Gravity would then be so strong that\nemitted light could not escape-it would be pulled back in by the force of\ngravity. Since no radiation could escape from such a "star," we could not see it-\nit would be black. An object may pass by it and be deflected by its gravitational\nfield, but if the object came too close it would be swallowed up, never to escape.\nThis is a black hole.\nNovae and Supernovae\nNovae (singular is nova, meaning "new" in Latin) are faint stars that have sud-\ndenly increased in brightness by as much as a factor of 106 and last for a month or\ntwo before fading. Novae are thought to be faint white dwarfs that have pulled\nmass from a nearby companion (they make up a binary system), as illustrated in\nFig. 33-10. The captured mass of hydrogen suddenly fuses into helium at a high\nrate for a few weeks. Many novae (maybe all) are recurrent-they repeat their\nbright glow years later.\n956 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Supernovae are also brief explosive events, but release millions of times more\nenergy than novae, up to 1010 times more luminous than our Sun. The peak of\nbrightness may exceed that of the entire galaxy in which they are located, but lasts\nonly a few days or weeks. They slowly fade over a few months. Many supernovae\nform by core collapse to a neutron star as described above. See Fig. 33-9.\nType Ia supernovae are different. They all seem to have very nearly the same\nluminosity. They are believed to be binary stars, one of which is a white dwarf\nthat pulls mass from its companion, much like for a nova, Fig. 33-10. The mass is\nhigher, and as mass is captured and the total mass approaches the Chandrasekhar\nlimit of 1.4 solar masses, it explodes as a "white-dwarf" supernova by undergoing\na "thermonuclear runaway"-an uncontrolled chain of nuclear reactions that\nentirely destroys the white dwarf. Type Ia supernovae are useful to us as\n"standard candles" in the night sky to help us determine distance-see next Section.\n33-3 Distance Measurements\nParallax\nWe have talked about the vast distances of objects in the universe. But how do\nwe measure these distances? One basic technique employs simple geometry to\nmeasure the parallax of a star. By parallax we mean the apparent motion of\na star, against the background of much more distant stars, due to the Earth\'s\nmotion around the Sun. As shown in Fig. 33-11, we can measure the angle 20\nthat the star appears to shift, relative to very distant stars, when viewed 6 months\napart. If we know the distance d from Earth to Sun, we can reconstruct the right\ntriangles shown in Fig. 33-11 and can then determine the distance D to the\nstar.

Beyond that distance, parallax angles are too small to measure. For\ngreater distances, more subtle techniques must be employed. We might compare\nthe apparent brightnesses of two stars, or two galaxies, and use the inverse square\nlaw (apparent brightness drops off as the square of the distance) to roughly esti-\nmate their relative distances. We can\'t expect this technique to be very precise\nbecause we don\'t expect any two stars, or two galaxies, to have the same intrinsic\nluminosity. When comparing galaxies, a perhaps better estimate assumes the\nbrightest stars in all galaxies (or the brightest galaxies in galaxy clusters) are sim-\nilar and have about the same intrinsic luminosity. Consequently, their apparent\nbrightness would be a measure of how far away they were.\nAnother technique makes use of the H-R diagram. Measurement of a star\'s\nsurface temperature (from its spectrum) places it at a certain point (within 20%)\non the H-R diagram, assuming it is a main-sequence star, and then its luminosity\ncan be estimated from the vertical axis (Fig. 33-6). Its apparent brightness and\nEq. 33-1 give its approximate distance; see Example 33-5.\nA better estimate comes from comparing variable stars, especially Cepheid\nvariables whose luminosity varies over time with a period that is found to be\nrelated to their average luminosity. Thus, from their period and apparent bright-\nness we get their distance.\nDistance via SNIa, Redshift\nThe largest distances are estimated by comparing the apparent brightnesses\nof Type Ia supernovae ("SNIa"). Type Ia supernovae all have a similar origin (as\ndescribed on the previous page and Fig. 33-10), and their brief explosive burst of\nlight is expected to be of nearly the same luminosity. They are thus sometimes\nreferred to as "standard candles."\n958 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Another important technique for estimating the distance of very distant\ngalaxies is from the "redshift" in the line spectra of elements and compounds.\nThe redshift is related to the expansion of the universe, as we shall discuss in\nSection 33-5. It is useful for objects farther than 107 to 108 ly away.\nAs we look farther and farther away, measurement techniques are less and\nless reliable, so there is more uncertainty in the measurements of large distances.\n33-4 General Relativity: Gravity\nand the Curvature of Space\nWe have seen that the force of gravity plays an important role in the processes\nthat occur in stars. Gravity too is important for the evolution of the universe as\na whole. The reasons gravity plays a dominant role in the universe, and not one\nof the other of the four forces in nature, are (1) it is long-range and (2) it is always\nattractive. The strong and weak nuclear forces act over very short distances only,\non the order of the size of a nucleus; hence they do not act over astronomical\ndistances (they do act between nuclei and nucleons in stars to produce nuclear\nreactions). The electromagnetic force, like gravity, acts over great distances. But\nit can be either attractive or repulsive. And since the universe does not seem to\ncontain large areas of net electric charge, a large net force does not occur. But\ngravity acts only as an attractive force between all masses, and there are large\naccumulations of mass in the universe. The force of gravity as Newton described\nit in his law of universal gravitation was modified by Einstein. In his general\ntheory of relativity, Einstein developed a theory of gravity that now forms the\nbasis of cosmological dynamics.\nIn the special theory of relativity (Chapter 26), Einstein concluded that there\nis no way for an observer to determine whether a given frame of reference is at\nrest or is moving at constant velocity in a straight line. Thus the laws of physics\nmust be the same in different inertial reference frames. But what about the more\ngeneral case of motion where reference frames can be accelerating?\nEinstein tackled the problem of accelerating reference frames in his general\ntheory of relativity and in it also developed a theory of gravity. The mathematics\nof General Relativity is complex, so our discussion will be mainly qualitative.\nWe begin with Einstein\'s principle of equivalence, which states that\nFIGURE 33-12 In an elevator\nfalling freely under gravity,\n(a) a person releases a book; (b) the\nreleased book hovers next to the\nowner\'s hand; (b) is a few moments\nafter (a).\nno experiment can be performed that could distinguish between a uniform\ngravitational field and an equivalent uniform acceleration.\nIf observers sensed that they were accelerating (as in a vehicle speeding around\na sharp curve), they could not prove by any experiment that in fact they weren\'t\nsimply experiencing the pull of a gravitational field. Conversely, we might think\nwe are being pulled by gravity when in fact we are undergoing an acceleration\nhaving nothing to do with gravity.\n00\n(a)\nAs a thought experiment, consider a person in a freely falling elevator near\nthe Earth\'s surface. If our observer held out a book and let go of it, what would\nhappen? Gravity would pull it downward toward the Earth, but at the same rate\n(g = 9.8 m/s2) at which the person and elevator were falling. So the book would\nhover right next to the person\'s hand (Fig. 33-12). The effect is exactly the same\nas if this reference frame was at rest and no forces were acting. On the other\nhand, if the elevator was out in space where the gravitational field is essentially\nzero, the released book would float, just as it does in Fig. 33-12. Next, if the\nelevator (out in space) is accelerated upward (using rockets) at an acceleration of\n9.8 m/s2, the book as seen by our observer would fall to the floor with an\nacceleration of 9.8 m/s2, just as if it were falling due to gravity at the surface of\nthe Earth. According to the principle of equivalence, the observer could not\ndetermine whether the book fell because the elevator was accelerating upward,\nor because a gravitational field was acting downward and the elevator was at rest.\nThe two descriptions are equivalent.\ng\n(b)\nSECTION 33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space 959\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The principle of equivalence is related to the concept that there are two types\nof mass. Newton\'s second law, F = ma, uses inertial mass. We might say that\ninertial mass represents "resistance" to any type of force. The second type of\nmass is gravitational mass. When one object attracts another by the gravitational\nforce (Newton\'s law of universal gravitation, F = Gm1m2/r2, Chapter 5), the\nstrength of the force is proportional to the product of the gravitational masses of\nthe two objects. This is much like Coulomb\'s law for the electric force between\ntwo objects which is proportional to the product of their electric charges. The\nelectric charge on an object is not related to its inertial mass; so why should we\nexpect that an object\'s gravitational mass (call it gravitational charge if you like)\nbe related to its inertial mass? All along we have assumed they were the same.\nWhy? Because no experiment-not even of high precision-has been able to dis-\ncern any measurable difference between inertial mass and gravitational mass. (For\nexample, in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall at the same acceleration, g,\non Earth.) This is another way to state the equivalence principle: gravitational mass\nis equivalent to inertial mass.\nFIGURE 33-13 (a) Light beam goes straight\nacross an elevator which is not accelerating.\n(b) The light beam bends (exaggerated) according\nto an observer in an accelerating elevator whose\nspeed increases in the upward direction.\nFIGURE 33-14 (a) Two stars in the\nsky observed from Earth.

Consider another\nthought experiment, in which an elevator is in free space where virtually no\ngravity acts. If a light beam is emitted by a flashlight attached to the side of the\nelevator, the beam travels straight across the elevator and makes a spot on the\nopposite side if the elevator is at rest or moving at constant velocity (Fig. 33-13a).\nIf instead the elevator is accelerating upward, as in Fig. 33-13b, the light beam\nstill travels straight across in a reference frame at rest. In the upwardly accelerating\nelevator, however, the beam is observed to curve downward. Why? Because\nduring the time the light travels from one side of the elevator to the other, the\nelevator is moving upward at a vertical speed that is increasing relative to the\nlight. Next we note that according to the equivalence principle, an upwardly accel-\nerating reference frame is equivalent to a downward gravitational field. Hence,\nwe can picture the curved light path in Fig. 33-13b as being due to the effect of a\ngravitational field. Thus, from the principle of equivalence, we expect gravity to\nexert a force on a beam of light and to bend it out of a straight-line path!\nThat light is affected by gravity is an important prediction of Einstein\'s\ngeneral theory of relativity. And it can be tested. The amount a light beam would\nbe deflected from a straight-line path must be small even when passing a massive\nobject. (For example, light near the Earth\'s surface after traveling 1 km is pre-\ndicted to drop only about 10-10 m, which is equal to the diameter of a small\natom and not detectable.) The most massive object near us is the Sun, and it was\ncalculated that light from a distant star would be deflected by 1.75" of arc (tiny\nbut detectable) as it passed by the edge of the Sun (Fig. 33-14). However, such\na measurement could be made only during a total eclipse of the Sun, so that the\nSun\'s tremendous brightness would not obscure the starlight passing near its edge.\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Observer\nFalse\nimage\nQuasar\nGalaxy\nLight from Quasar\nFalse\nimage\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 33-15 (a) Hubble Space Telescope photograph of the so-called "Einstein cross," thought to represent\n"gravitational lensing": the central spot is a relatively nearby galaxy, whereas the four other spots are thought to be\nimages of a single quasar behind the galaxy.

Such a ring is called an "Einstein ring."]\nAn opportune eclipse occurred in 1919, and scientists journeyed to the South\nAtlantic to observe it. Their photos of stars just behind the Sun revealed shifts in\naccordance with Einstein\'s prediction. Another example of gravitational deflection\nof light is gravitational lensing, as described in Fig. 33-15. The very distant galaxies\nshown in the XDF photo at the start of this Chapter, page 947, are thought to be\nvisible only because of gravitational lensing (and magnification of their emitted\nlight) by nearer galaxies-as if the nearby galaxies acted as a magnifying glass.\nThe mathematician Fermat showed in the 1600s that optical phenomena,\nincluding reflection, refraction, and effects of lenses, can be derived from a\nsimple principle: that light traveling between two points follows the shortest\npath in space. Thus if gravity curves the path of light, then gravity must be able to\ncurve space itself. That is, space itself can be curved, and it is gravitational mass\nthat causes the curvature. Indeed, the curvature of space-or rather, of four-\ndimensional space-time-is a basic aspect of Einstein\'s General Relativity.\nWhat is meant by curved space? To understand, recall that our normal\nmethod of viewing the world is via Euclidean plane geometry. In Euclidean\ngeometry, there are many axioms and theorems we take for granted, such as that\nthe sum of the angles of any triangle is 180º. Non-Euclidean geometries, which\ninvolve curved space, have also been imagined by mathematicians. It is hard\nenough to imagine three-dimensional curved space, much less curved four-\ndimensional space-time. So let us try to understand the idea of curved space by\nusing two-dimensional surfaces.\nConsider, for example, the two-dimensional surface of a sphere. It is clearly\ncurved, Fig. 33-16, at least to us who view it from the outside-from our three-\ndimensional world. But how would hypothetical two-dimensional creatures\ndetermine whether their two-dimensional space was flat (a plane) or curved?\nOne way would be to measure the sum of the angles of a triangle. If the surface is\na plane, the sum of the angles is 180°, as we learn in plane geometry. But if the\nspace is curved, and a sufficiently large triangle is constructed, the sum of the\nangles will not be 180°. To construct a triangle on a curved surface, say the sphere\nof Fig. 33-16, we must use the equivalent of a straight line: that is, the shortest\ndistance between two points, which is called a geodesic. On a sphere, a geodesic\nis an arc of a great circle (an arc in a plane passing through the center of the\nsphere) such as the Earth\'s equator and the Earth\'s longitude lines. Consider, for\nexample, the large triangle of Fig. 33-16: its sides are two longitude lines passing\nfrom the north pole to the equator, and the third side is a section of the equator\nas shown. The two longitude lines make 90° angles with the equator (look at\na world globe to see this more clearly). They make an angle with each other at\nthe north pole, which could be, say, 90° as shown; the sum of these angles is\n90° + 90° + 90° = 270°. This is clearly not a Euclidean space. Note, however,\nthat if the triangle is small in comparison to the radius of the sphere, the angles\nwill add up to nearly 180°, and the triangle (and space) will seem flat.\nFIGURE 33-16 On a\ntwo-dimensional curved surface,\nthe sum of the angles of a triangle\nmay not be 180º.\n"North pole"\n90°\n90º\n90º\nEquator\nEarth\nSECTION 33-4 961\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': "O\nr\nC -\n.\na\n- C-\nFIGURE 33-17 On a spherical surface\n(a two-dimensional world) a circle of\ncircumference C is drawn (red) about point O\nas the center.

On a large scale (not just near a large mass), what is\nthe overall curvature of the universe? Does it have positive curvature, negative\ncurvature, or is it flat (zero curvature)? We perceive our world as Euclidean\n(flat), but we can not exclude the possibility that space could have a curvature so\nslight that we don't normally notice it. This is a crucial question in cosmology,\nand it can be answered only by precise experimentation.\nIf the universe had a positive curvature, the universe would be closed, or\nfinite in volume. This would not mean that the stars and galaxies extended out to\na certain boundary, beyond which there is empty space. There is no boundary or\nedge in such a universe. The universe is all there is. If a particle were to move in\na straight line in a particular direction, it would eventually return to the starting\npoint-perhaps eons of time later.\nOn the other hand, if the curvature of space was zero or negative, the\nuniverse would be open. It could just go on forever. An open universe could be\ninfinite; but according to recent research, even that may not necessarily be so.\nToday the evidence is very strong that the universe on a large scale is very\nclose to being flat. Indeed, it is so close to being flat that we can't tell if it might\nhave very slightly positive or very slightly negative curvature.\nBlack Holes\nAccording to Einstein's theory of general relativity (sometimes abbreviated GR),\nspace-time is curved near massive objects. We might think of space as being\nlike a thin rubber sheet: if a heavy weight is placed on the sheet, it sags\nas shown in Fig. 33-19a (top of next page). The weight corresponds to a\nhuge mass that causes space (space itself!) to curve. Thus, in the context of\n962 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology\n", 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'general relativity+ we do not speak of the "force" of gravity acting on objects.\nInstead we say that objects and light rays move as they do because space-time\nis curved. An object starting at rest or moving slowly near the great mass of\nFig. 33-19a would follow a geodesic (the equivalent of a straight line in plane\ngeometry) toward that great mass.\nThe extreme curvature of space-time shown in Fig. 33-19b could be produced\nby a black hole. A black hole, as we mentioned in Section 33-2, has such strong\ngravity that even light cannot escape from it. To become a black hole, an object\nof mass M must undergo gravitational collapse, contracting by gravitational self-\nattraction to within a radius called the Schwarzschild radius,\n2GM\nR = 2CM,\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and c the speed of light. If an object col-\nlapses to within this radius, it is predicted by general relativity to collapse\nto a point at r = 0, forming an infinitely dense singularity. This prediction is\nuncertain, however, because in this realm we need to combine quantum mechan-\nics with gravity, a unification of theories not yet achieved (Section 32-12).\nEXERCISE C What is the Schwarzschild radius for an object with 10 solar masses?\nThe Schwarzschild radius also represents the event horizon of a black hole.\nBy event horizon we mean the surface beyond which no emitted signals can ever\nreach us, and thus inform us of events that happen beyond that surface. As a star\ncollapses toward a black hole, the light it emits is pulled harder and harder by\ngravity, but we can still see it. Once the matter passes within the event horizon,\nthe emitted light cannot escape but is pulled back in by gravity (= curvature of\nspace-time).\nAll we can know about a black hole is its mass, its angular momentum\n(rotating black holes), and its electric charge. No other information, no\ndetails of its structure or the kind of matter it was formed of, can be known\nbecause no information can escape.\nHow might we observe black holes? We cannot see them because no light\ncan escape from them. They would be black objects against a black sky. But they\ndo exert a gravitational force on nearby objects, and also on light rays (or photons)\nthat pass nearby (just like in Fig. 33-15). The black hole believed to be at the\ncenter of our Galaxy (M ~ 4 × 106 Msun) was discovered by examining the\nmotion of matter in its vicinity. Another technique is to examine stars which\nappear to move as if they were one member of a binary system (two stars rotating\nabout their common center of mass), but without a visible companion. If the\nunseen star is a black hole, it might be expected to pull off gaseous material from\nits visible companion (as in Fig. 33-10). As this matter approached the black\nhole, it would be highly accelerated and should emit X-rays of a characteristic\ntype before plunging inside the event horizon. Such X-rays, plus a sufficiently\nhigh mass estimate from the rotational motion, can provide evidence for a black\nhole. One of the many candidates for a black hole is in the binary-star system\nCygnus X-1. It is widely believed that the center of most galaxies is occupied by\na black hole with a mass 106 to 109 times the mass of a typical star like our Sun.\nMass\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 33-19 (a) Rubber-sheet\nanalogy for space-time curved by\nmatter.

But what about the universe\nas a whole: is it static, or does it change? One of the most important scientific\ndiscoveries of the twentieth century was that distant galaxies are racing away\nfrom us, and that the farther they are from us at a given time, the faster they are\nmoving away. How astronomers arrived at this astonishing idea, and what it\nmeans for the past history of the universe as well as its future, will occupy us for\nthe remainder of the book.\nObservational evidence that the universe is expanding was first put forth by\nEdwin Hubble in 1929. This idea was based on distance measurements of galaxies\n(Section 33-3), and determination of their velocities by the Doppler shift of\nspectral lines in the light received from them (Fig. 33-20). In Chapter 12 we saw\nhow the frequency of sound is higher and the wavelength shorter if the source\nand observer move toward each other. If the source moves away from the\nobserver, the frequency is lower and the wavelength longer. The Doppler effect\noccurs also for light, but the formula for light is slightly different than for sound\nand is given by+\n1 + v/c\n,\nJobs = Arest V1 - v/C\nsource and observer moving\n(33-3)\naway from each other\nwhere Arest is the emitted wavelength as seen in a reference frame at rest with\nrespect to the source, and Àobs is the wavelength observed in a frame moving with\nvelocity v away from the source along the line of sight. (For relative motion\ntoward each other, v < 0 in this formula.) When a distant source emits light of\na particular wavelength, and the source is moving away from us, the wavelength\nappears longer to us: the color of the light (if it is visible) is shifted toward the red\nend of the visible spectrum, an effect known as a redshift. (If the source moves\ntoward us, the color shifts toward the blue or shorter wavelength.)\nIn the spectra of stars in other galaxies, lines are observed that correspond to\nlines in the known spectra of particular atoms (see Section 27-11 and Figs. 24-28\nand 27-23). What Hubble found was that the lines seen in the spectra from\ndistant galaxies were generally redshifted, and that the amount of shift seemed to\nbe approximately proportional to the distance of the galaxy from us. That is, the\nvelocity v of a galaxy moving away from us is proportional to its distance d from us:\nHUBBLE'S LAW\nv = H0d.\n(33-4)\nThis is Hubble's law, one of the most fundamental astronomical ideas. It was first\nsuggested, in 1927, by Georges Lemaître, a Belgian physics professor and priest,\nwho also first proposed what later came to be called the Big Bang. The con-\nstant H0 is called the Hubble parameter.\nThe value of H0 until recently was uncertain by over 20%, and thought to be\nbetween 15 and 25 km/s/Mly. But recent measurements now put its value more\nprecisely at\nHo = 21 km/s/Mly\n(that is, 21 km/s per million light-years of distance). The current uncertainty is\nabout 2%, or + 0.5 km/s/Mly. [Ho can be written in terms of parsecs (Section 33-3)\nas Ho = 67 km/s/Mpc (that is, 67 km/s per megaparsec of distance) with an\nuncertainty of about + 1.2 km/s/Mpc.]\n+For light there is no medium and we can make no distinction between motion of the source and\nmotion of the observer (special relativity), as we did for sound which travels in a medium.\n964 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology\n", 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Redshift Origins\nGalaxies very near us seem to be moving randomly relative to us: some move\ntowards us (blueshifted), others away from us (redshifted); their speeds are on\nthe order of 0.001c. But for more distant galaxies, the velocity of recession is much\ngreater than the velocity of local random motion, and so is dominant and Hubble's\nlaw (Eq. 33-4) holds very well. More distant galaxies have higher recession\nvelocity and a larger redshift, and we call their redshift a cosmological redshift.\nWe interpret this redshift today as due to the expansion of space itself. We can\nthink of the originally emitted wavelength Arest as being stretched out (becoming\nlonger) along with the expanding space around it, as suggested in Fig. 33-21.\nAlthough Hubble thought of the redshift as a Doppler shift, now we prefer to\nunderstand it in this sense of expanding space. (But note that atoms in galaxies\ndo not expand as space expands; they keep their regular size.)\nThere is a third way to produce a redshift, which we mention for completeness:\na gravitational redshift. Light leaving a massive star is gaining in gravitational\npotential energy (just like a stone thrown upward from Earth). So the kinetic\nenergy of each photon, hf, must be getting smaller (to conserve energy). A smaller\nfrequency f means a larger (longer) wavelength À (= c/f), which is a redshift.\nThe amount of a redshift is specified by the redshift parameter, z, defined as\n=\nJobs - Arest = 11,\n(33-5a)\nz\nÀrest\nÀrest\nwhere Àrest is a wavelength as seen by an observer at rest relative to the source,\nand Àobs is the wavelength measured by a moving observer.

For high z galaxies, not even Eq. 33-3 applies because the redshift is due\nto the expansion of space (cosmological redshift), not the Doppler effect. Our\nChapter-Opening Photograph, page 947, shows two very distant high z galaxies,\nz = 8.8 and 11.9, which are also shown enlarged.\nFIGURE 33-21 Simplified model of\na 2-dimensional universe, imagined\nas a balloon. As you blow up the\nballoon (= expanding universe), the\nwavelength of a wave on its surface\ngets longer (redshifted).\n* Scale Factor (advanced)\nThe expansion of space can be described as a scaling of the typical distance between\ntwo points or objects in the universe. If two distant galaxies are a distance d0\napart at some initial time, then a time t later they will be separated by a greater\ndistance d(t). The scale factor is the same as for light, expressed in Eq. 33-5a:\nd0\nd(t) - do = AX = z\n1\nd(t)\nd0\n= 1 + z.\nor\nThus, for example, if a galaxy has z = 3, then the scale factor is now\n(1 + 3) = 4 times larger than when the light was emitted from that galaxy.\nThat is, the average distance between galaxies has become 4 times larger. Thus\nthe factor by which the wavelength has increased since it was emitted tells us by\nwhat factor the universe (or the typical distance between objects) has increased.\nSECTION 33-5 The Expanding Universe: Redshift and Hubble's Law 965\n", 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': "1\n-\n.\nEarth\nA\nB\nA\nA\nEarth\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 33-22 Expansion of the universe looks the same from any point in the universe. If you are on Earth\nas shown in part (a), or you are instead at galaxy A (which is at rest in the reference frame shown in (b)), all\nother galaxies appear to be racing away from you.\nExpansion, and the Cosmological Principle\nWhat does it mean that distant galaxies are all moving away from us, and with\never greater speed the farther they are from us? It seems to suggest some kind of\nexplosive expansion that started at some very distant time in the past. And at\nfirst sight we seem to be in the middle of it all. But we aren't. The expansion\nappears the same from any other point in the universe. To understand why, see\nFig. 33-22. In Fig. 33-22a we have the view from Earth (or from our Galaxy).\nThe velocities of surrounding galaxies are indicated by arrows, pointing away\nfrom us, and the arrows are longer (faster speeds) for galaxies more distant from\nus. Now, what if we were on the galaxy labeled A in Fig. 33-22a? From Earth,\ngalaxy A appears to be moving to the right at a velocity, call it VA , represented by\nthe arrow pointing to the right. If we were on galaxy A, Earth would appear to be\nmoving to the left at velocity -VA · To determine the velocities of other galaxies\nrelative to A, we vectorially add the velocity vector, -VA , to all the velocity arrows\nshown in Fig. 33-22a. This yields Fig. 33-22b, where we see that the universe\nis expanding away from galaxy A as well; and the velocities of galaxies receding\nfrom A are proportional to their current distance from A. The universe looks\npretty much the same from different points.\nThus the expansion of the universe can be stated as follows: all galaxies are\nracing away from each other at an average rate of about 21 km/s per million light-\nyears of distance between them. The ramifications of this idea are profound, and\nwe discuss them in a moment.\nA basic assumption in cosmology has been that on a large scale, the universe\nwould look the same to observers at different places at the same time. In other\nwords, the universe is both isotropic (looks the same in all directions) and\nhomogeneous (would look the same if we were located elsewhere, say in another\ngalaxy). This assumption is called the cosmological principle. On a local scale,\nsay in our solar system or within our Galaxy, it clearly does not apply (the sky\nlooks different in different directions). But it has long been thought to be valid\nif we look on a large enough scale, so that the average population density of\ngalaxies and clusters of galaxies ought to be the same in different areas of the sky.\nThis seems to be valid on distances greater than about 700 Mly. The expansion of\nthe universe (Fig. 33-22) is consistent with the cosmological principle; and the\nnear uniformity of the cosmic microwave background radiation (discussed in\nSection 33-6) supports it. Another way to state the cosmological principle is that\nour place in the universe is not special.\nThe expansion of the universe, as described by Hubble's law, strongly\nsuggests that galaxies must have been closer together in the past than they are\nnow. This is, in fact, the basis of the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe,\nwhich pictures the universe as a relentless expansion starting from a very hot and\ncompressed beginning. We discuss the Big Bang in detail shortly, but first let us\nsee what can be said about the age of the universe.\n966 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology\n", 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'One way to estimate the age of the universe uses the Hubble parameter.\nWith Ho ~ 21 km/s per 106 light-years, the time required for the galaxies to\narrive at their present separations would be approximately (starting with v = d/t\nand using Hubble\'s law, Eq. 33-4),\nt = d = d = 1\nH0d\n22\n(106 ly)(0.95 × 1013 km/ly)\nH0\n(21 km/s)(3.16 × 107 s/yr)\n~ 14 × 109 yr,\nor 14 billion years. The age of the universe calculated in this way is called the\ncharacteristic expansion time or "Hubble age." It is a very rough estimate and\nassumes the rate of expansion of the universe was constant (which today we are\nquite sure is not true). Today\'s best measurements give the age of the universe as\nabout 13.8 × 109 yr, in remarkable agreement with the rough Hubble age estimate.\n* Steady-State Model\nBefore discussing the Big Bang in detail, we mention one alternative to the Big\nBang-the steady-state model-which assumed that the universe is infinitely old\nand on average looks the same now as it always has. (This assumed uniformity in\ntime as well as space was called the perfect cosmological principle.) According to\nthe steady-state model, no large-scale changes have taken place in the universe\nas a whole, particularly no Big Bang. To maintain this view in the face of the\nrecession of galaxies away from each other, matter would need to be created\ncontinuously to maintain the assumption of uniformity. The rate of mass creation\nrequired is very small-about one nucleon per cubic meter every 109 years.\nThe steady-state model provided the Big Bang model with healthy competi-\ntion in the mid-twentieth century. But the discovery of the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation (next Section), as well as other observations of the universe,\nhas made the Big Bang model universally accepted.\n33-6 The Big Bang and the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background\nThe expansion of the universe suggests that typical objects in the universe were\nonce much closer together than they are now. This is the basis for the idea that\nthe universe began about 14 billion years ago as an expansion from a state of very\nhigh density and temperature known affectionately as the Big Bang.\nThe birth of the universe was not an explosion, because an explosion blows\npieces out into the surrounding space. Instead, the Big Bang was the start of an\nexpansion of space itself. The observable universe was relatively very small at the\nstart and has been expanding, getting ever larger, ever since. The initial tiny uni-\nverse of extremely dense matter is not to be thought of as a concentrated mass in\nthe midst of a much larger space around it. The initial tiny but dense universe was\nthe entire universe. There wouldn\'t have been anything else. When we say that\nthe universe was once smaller than it is now, we mean that the average separation\nbetween objects (such as electrons or galaxies) was less. The universe may have\nbeen infinite in extent even then, and it may still be now (only bigger). The\nobservable universe (that which we have the possibility of observing because\nlight has had time to reach us) is, however, finite.\nA major piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang is the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation (or CMB) whose discovery came about as follows.\nIn 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson pointed their horn antenna for\ndetecting radio waves (Fig. 33-23) into the sky. With it they detected widespread\nemission, and became convinced that it was coming from outside our Galaxy.\nThey made precise measurements at a wavelength À = 7.35 cm, in the micro-\nwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 22-8). The intensity of this\nradiation was found initially not to vary by day or night or time of year, nor to\ndepend on direction. It came from all directions in the universe with equal\nintensity, to a precision of better than 1%. It could only be concluded that this\nradiation came from the universe as a whole.\nFIGURE 33-23 Photo of Arno\nPenzias (right, who signed it\n"Arno") and Robert Wilson.

But theorists felt that there needed to be some small\ninhomogeneities, or "anisotropies," in the CMB that would have provided\n"seeds" at which galaxy formation could have started. Small areas of slightly\nhigher density, which could have contracted under gravity to form clusters of\ngalaxies, were indeed found. These tiny inhomogeneities in density and tempera-\nture were detected first by the COBE satellite experiment in 1992, led by George\nSmoot and John Mather (Fig. 33-25).\nThis discovery of the anisotropy of the CMB ranks with the discovery of the CMB\nitself in the history of cosmology. The blackbody fit and the anisotropy were the cul-\nmination of decades of research by pioneers such as Richard Muller, Paul Richards,\nand David Wilkinson. Subsequent experiments gave us greater detail in 2003, 2006,\nand 2012 with the WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) results,\nFig. 33-26, and even more recently with the European Planck satellite results in 2013.\nThe CMB provides strong evidence in support of the Big Bang, and gives us\ninformation about conditions in the very early universe. In fact, in the late 1940s,\nGeorge Gamow and his collaborators calculated that a Big Bang origin of the\nuniverse should have generated just such a microwave background radiation.\nGeorge 7 Amist\nTo understand why, let us look at what a Big Bang might have been like.\n(Today we usually use the term "Big Bang" to refer to the process, starting from\na moment after the birth of the universe through the subsequent expansion.) The\ntemperature must have been extremely high at the start, so high that there could\nnot have been any atoms in the very early stages of the universe (high energy\ncollisions would have broken atoms apart into nuclei and free electrons). Instead,\nthe universe would have consisted solely of radiation (photons) and a plasma of\ncharged electrons and other elementary particles. The universe would have been\nFIGURE 33-26 Measurements of the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation over the entire\nsky, color-coded to represent differences in temperature\nfrom the average 2.725 K: the color scale ranges\nfrom +200 μ (red) to -200 μΚ (dark blue),\nrepresenting slightly hotter and colder spots\n(associated with variations in density).

Indeed, the details of the microwave\nbackground radiation provide strong evidence that matter and radiation were once in\nequilibrium at a very high temperature. As the universe expanded, the energy spread\nout over an increasingly larger volume and the temperature dropped. Not long\nbefore the temperature had fallen to ~ 3000 K, some 380,000 years later, could nuclei\nand electrons combine together as stable atoms. With the disappearance of free elec-\ntrons, as they combined with nuclei to form atoms, the radiation would have been\nfreed-decoupled from matter, we say. The universe became transparent because\nphotons were now free to travel nearly unimpeded straight through the universe.\nIt is this radiation, from 380,000 years after the birth of the universe, that we\nnow see as the CMB. As the universe expanded, so too the wavelengths of the\nradiation lengthened, thus redshifting to longer wavelengths that correspond to\nlower temperature (recall Wien\'s law, ApT = constant, Section 27-2), until they\nwould have reached the 2.7-K background radiation we observe today.\nLooking Back toward the Big Bang-Lookback Time\nFigure 33-27 shows our Earth point of view, looking out in all directions back\ntoward the Big Bang and the brief (380,000-year-long) period when radiation was\ntrapped in the early plasma (yellow band). The time it takes light to reach us\nfrom an event is called its lookback time. The "close-up" insert in Fig. 33-27\nshows a photon scattering repeatedly inside that early plasma and then exiting\nthe plasma in a straight line. No matter what direction we look, our view of the\nvery early universe is blocked by this wall of plasma. It is like trying to look into\na very thick fog or into the surface of the Sun-we can see only as far as its\nsurface, called the surface of last scattering, but not into it.

We cannot\nsee quite as far as the Big Bang; we can see only as far as the\n"surface of last scattering," which radiated the CMB. The\ninsert on the lower right shows the earliest 380,000 years of\nthe universe when it was opaque: a photon is shown\nscattering many times and then (at decoupling, 380,000 yr\nafter the birth of the universe) becoming free to travel in\na straight line. If this photon wasn\'t heading our way when\n"liberated," many others were. Galaxies are not shown, but\nwould be concentrated close to Earth in this diagram because\nthey were created relatively recently. Note: This diagram is\nnot a normal map. Maps show a section of the world as might\nbe seen all at a given time. This diagram shows space (like a\nmap), but each point is not at the same time. The light coming\nfrom a point a distance r from Earth took a time At\' = r/c\nto reach Earth, and thus shows an event that took place long\nago, a time At\' = r/c in the past, which we call its "lookback\ntime."

Better yet, it shows the most we could see.\nSECTION 33-6 969\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 24, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'ro = cto\nro = cto\nHer Us\nFIGURE 33-28 Two observers, on\nwidely separated galaxies, have\ndifferent horizons, different\nobservable universes.\nWe would undoubtedly be arrogant to think that we could see the entire\nuniverse.

Part\nof this theory is based on recent theoretical and experimental advances in ele-\nmentary particle physics, and part from observations of the universe including\nCOBE, WMAP, and Planck. Indeed, cosmology and elementary particle physics\nhave cross-fertilized to a surprising extent.\nLet us go back to the earliest of times-as close as possible to the Big\nBang-and follow a Standard Model theoretical scenario of events as the universe\nexpanded and cooled after the Big Bang. Initially we talk of extremely small time\nintervals as well as extremely high temperatures, far higher than any temperature\nin the universe today. Figure 33-29 is a compressed graphical representation of\nthe events, and it may be helpful to consult it as we go along.\nFIGURE 33-29 Compressed graphical representation of the development of the universe\nafter the Big Bang, according to modern cosmology.

This time (sometimes referred to as the Planck time) is an\nunimaginably short time, and predictions can be only speculative. Earlier, we can\nsay nothing because we do not have a theory of quantum gravity which would be\nneeded for the incredibly high densities and temperatures during this "Planck era."\nThe first theories of the Big Bang assumed the universe was extremely hot in\nthe beginning, maybe 1032 K, and then gradually cooled down while expanding.\nIn those first moments after 10-43 s, the four forces of nature were thought to be\nunited-there was only one force (Chapter 32, Fig. 32-22). Then a kind of\n970 CHAPTER 33\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 25, 'type': 'text', 'content': '"phase transition" would have occurred during which the gravitational force\nwould have "condensed out" as a separate force. This and subsequent phase\ntransitions, as shown in Fig. 32-22, are analogous to phase transitions water\nundergoes as it cools from a gas condensing into a liquid, and with further cooling\nfreezes into ice.+ The symmetry of the four forces would have been broken\nleaving the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces still unified, and the universe\nwould have entered the grand unified era (GUT-see Section 32-11).\nThis scenario of a hot Big Bang is now doubted by some important theorists,\nsuch as Andreí Linde, whose theories suggest the universe was much cooler at\nthe Planck time. But what happened next to the universe, though very strange, is\naccepted by most cosmologists: a brilliant idea, suggested by Linde and Alan\nGuth in the early 1980s, proposed that the universe underwent an incredible\nexponential expansion, increasing in size by a factor of 1030 or maybe much more,\nin a tiny fraction of a second, perhaps 10-35 s or 10-32 s. The usefulness of this\ninflationary scenario is that it solved major problems with earlier Big Bang models,\nsuch as explaining why the universe is flat, as well as the thermal equilibrium to\nprovide the nearly uniform CMB, as discussed below.\nWhen inflation ended, whatever energy caused it then ended up being\ntransformed into elementary particles with very high kinetic energy, corresponding\nto very high temperature (Eq. 13-8, KE = 2kT). That process is referred to as\nreheating, and the universe was now a "soup" of leptons, quarks, and other\nparticles. We can think of this "soup" as a plasma of particles and antiparticles,\nas well as photons-all in roughly equal numbers-colliding with one another\nfrequently and exchanging energy.\nThe temperature of the universe at the end of inflation was much lower than\nthat expected by the hot Big Bang theory. But it would have been high enough so\nthat the weak and electromagnetic forces were unified into a single force, and\nthis stage of the universe is sometimes called the electroweak era. Approximately\n10-12 s after the Big Bang, the temperature dropped to about 1015 K corresponding\nto randomly moving particles with an average kinetic energy KE of about 100 GeV\n(see Eq. 13-8):\nKE ~ KT ~\n(1.4 × 10-23 J/K)(1015 K)\n1.6 × 10-19 J/eV\n~ 1011 eV = 100 GeV.\n(As an estimate, we usually ignore the factor 2 in Eq. 13-8.) At that time,\nsymmetry between weak and electromagnetic forces would have broken down,\nand the weak force separated from the electromagnetic.\nAs the universe cooled down to about 1012 K (KE ~ 100 MeV), approxi-\nmately 10-6 s after the Big Bang, quarks stop moving freely and begin to\n"condense" into more normal particles: nucleons and the other hadrons and their\nantiparticles. With this confinement of quarks, the universe entered the hadron\nera. But it did not last long. Very soon the vast majority of hadrons disappeared.\nTo see why, let us focus on the most familiar hadrons: nucleons and their anti-\nparticles. When the average kinetic energy of particles was somewhat higher than\n1 GeV, protons, neutrons, and their antiparticles were continually being created\nout of the energies of collisions involving photons and other particles, such as\nphotons -> p + p\n-> n + n.\nBut just as quickly, particles and antiparticles would annihilate: for example\np + p -> photons or leptons.\nSo the processes of creation and annihilation of nucleons were in equilibrium.\nThe numbers of nucleons and antinucleons were high-roughly as many as there\nwere electrons, positrons, or photons. But as the universe expanded and cooled,\nand the average kinetic energy of particles dropped below about 1 GeV, which is\nthe minimum energy needed in a typical collision to create nucleons and anti-\nnucleons (about 940 MeV each), the process of nucleon creation could not continue.\n+It may be interesting to point out that this story of origins here bears some resemblance to ancient\naccounts (nonscientific) that mention the "void," "formless wasteland" (or "darkness over the deep"),\n"abyss," "divide the waters" (= a phase transition?), not to mention the sudden appearance of light.\nSECTION 33-7 971\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 26, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Annihilation could continue, however, with antinucleons annihilating nucleons, until\nalmost no nucleons were left. But not quite zero. Somehow we need to explain our\npresent world of matter (nucleons and electrons) with very little antimatter in sight.\nTo explain our world of matter, we might suppose that earlier in the universe,\nafter the inflationary period, a slight excess of quarks over antiquarks was formed.+\nThis would have resulted in a slight excess of nucleons over antinucleons. And\nit is these "leftover" nucleons that we are made of today. The excess of nucleons\nover antinucleons was probably about one part in 109. During the hadron era,\nthere should have been about as many nucleons as photons. After it ended, the\n"leftover" nucleons thus numbered only about one nucleon per 109 photons, and\nthis ratio has persisted to this day. Protons, neutrons, and all other heavier particles\nwere thus tremendously reduced in number by about 10-6 s after the Big Bang.\nThe lightest hadrons, the pions, soon disappeared, about 10-4 s after the Big Bang;\nbecause they are the lightest mass hadrons (140 MeV), pions were the last hadrons\nable to be created as the temperature (and average kinetic energy) dropped.\nLighter particles, including electrons and neutrinos, were the dominant form of\nmatter, and the universe entered the lepton era.\nBy the time the first full second had passed (clearly the most eventful second\nin history!), the universe had cooled to about 10 billion degrees, 1010 K. The\naverage kinetic energy was about 1 MeV. This was still sufficient energy to create\nelectrons and positrons and balance their annihilation reactions, since their\nmasses correspond to about 0.5 MeV. So there were about as many e+ and e"\nas there were photons. But within a few more seconds, the temperature had\ndropped sufficiently so that e+ and e" could no longer be formed. Annihilation\n(e+ + e" -> photons) continued. And, like nucleons before them, electrons and\npositrons all but disappeared from the universe-except for a slight excess of\nelectrons over positrons (later to join with nuclei to form atoms). Thus, about\nt = 10 s after the Big Bang, the universe entered the radiation era (Fig. 33-29).\nIts major constituents were photons and neutrinos. But the neutrinos, partaking\nonly in the weak force, rarely interacted. So the universe, until then experiencing\nsignificant amounts of energy in matter and in radiation, now became\nradiation-dominated: much more energy was contained in radiation than in matter,\na situation that would last more than 50,000 years.\nDecoupling\n3K\nFIGURE 33-29 (Repeated.)

The temperature had dropped to about 109 K, corresponding to an aver-\nage kinetic energy KE ~ 100 keV, where nucleons could strike each other and be\nable to fuse (Section 31-3), but now cool enough so newly formed nuclei would\nnot be immediately broken apart by subsequent collisions. Deuterium, helium,\nand very tiny amounts of lithium nuclei were made. But the universe was cooling\ntoo quickly, and larger nuclei were not made. After only a few minutes, probably not\neven a quarter of an hour after the Big Bang, the temperature dropped far enough\nthat nucleosynthesis stopped, not to start again for millions of years (in stars).\n*Why this could have happened is a question for which we are seeking an answer today.\n972 CHAPTER 33\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 27, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Thus, after the first quarter hour or so of the universe, matter consisted mainly of\nbare nuclei of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 25%)+ as well as electrons.\nBut radiation (photons) continued to dominate.\nOur story is almost complete. The next important event is thought to have\noccurred 380,000 years later. The universe had expanded to about 1000 of its pres-\nent scale, and the temperature had cooled to about 3000 K. The average kinetic\nenergy of nuclei, electrons, and photons was less than an electron volt. Since\nionization energies of atoms are on the order of eV, then as the temperature\ndropped below this point, electrons could orbit the bare nuclei and remain there\n(without being ejected by collisions), thus forming atoms. This period is often\ncalled the recombination epoch (a misnomer since electrons had never before\nbeen combined with nuclei to form atoms). With the disappearance of free\nelectrons and the birth of atoms, the photons-which had been continually\nscattering from the free electrons-now became free to spread throughout the\nuniverse. As mentioned in the previous Section, we say that the photons became\ndecoupled from matter. Thus decoupling occurred at recombination. The energy\ncontained in radiation had been decreasing (lengthening in wavelength as the\nuniverse expanded); and at about t = 56,000 yr (even before decoupling) the\nenergy contained in matter became dominant over radiation. The universe was\nsaid to have become matter-dominated (marked on Fig. 33-29). As the universe\ncontinued to expand, the electromagnetic radiation cooled further, to 2.7 K today,\nforming the cosmic microwave background radiation we detect from everywhere\nin the universe.\nAfter the birth of atoms, then stars and galaxies could begin to form: by self-\ngravitation around mass concentrations (inhomogeneities). Stars began to form\nabout 200 million years after the Big Bang, galaxies after almost 109 years. The\nuniverse continued to evolve until today, some 14 billion years after it started.\n*\nThis scenario, like other scientific models, cannot be said to be "proven." Yet\nthis model is remarkably effective in explaining the evolution of the universe we\nlive in, and makes predictions which can be tested against the next generation of\nobservations.\nA major event, and something only discovered recently, is that when the\nuniverse was about half as old as it is now (about 7 Gyr ago), its expansion began\nto accelerate. This was a big surprise because it was assumed the expansion of the\nuniverse would slow down due to gravitational attraction of all objects toward\neach other. This acceleration in the expansion of the universe is said to be due to\n"dark energy," as we discuss in Section 33-9. On the right in Fig. 33-29 is\na narrow vertical strip that represents the most recent 7 billion years of the\nuniverse, during which dark energy seems to have dominated.\n33-8 Inflation: Explaining Flatness,\nUniformity, and Structure\nThe idea that the universe underwent a period of exponential inflation early in its\nlife, expanding by a factor of 1030 or more (previous Section), was first put forth\nby Alan Guth and Andreí Linde. Many sophisticated models based on this general\nidea have since been proposed. The energy required for this wild expansion may\nhave been due to fields somewhat like the Higgs field (Section 32-10). So far, the\nevidence for inflation is indirect; yet it is a feature of most viable cosmological\nmodels because it alone is able to provide natural explanations for several\nremarkable features of our universe.\n*This Standard Model prediction of a 25% primordial production of helium agrees with what we\nobserve today-the universe does contain about 25% He-and it is strong evidence in support of the\nStandard Big Bang Model. Furthermore, the theory says that 25% He abundance is fully consistent\nwith there being three neutrino types, which is the number we observe. And it sets an upper limit of\nfour to the maximum number of possible neutrino types. This is a striking example of the powerful\nconnection between particle physics and cosmology.\nSECTION 33-8 973\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 28, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 33-30 (a) Simple 2-D\nmodel of the entire universe; the\nobservable universe is suggested by\nthe small circle centered on us (blue\ndot).

As scientists, we would like some reason for this remarkable result. To\nsee how inflation explains flatness, consider a simple 2-dimensional model of the\nuniverse as we did earlier in Figs. 33-16 and 33-21. A circle in this 2-dimensional\nuniverse (= surface of a sphere, Fig. 33-30a) represents the observable universe as\nseen by an observer at the blue dot. A possible hypothesis is that inflation occurred\nover a time interval that very roughly doubled the age of the universe from, let us\nsay, t = 1 × 10-35 s to t = 2 × 10-35 s. The size of the observable universe\n(r = ct) would have increased by a factor of two during inflation, while the radius\nof curvature of the entire universe increased by an enormous factor of 1030 or\nmore. Thus the edge of our 2-D sphere representing the entire universe would\nhave seemed flat to a high degree of precision, as shown in Fig. 33-30b. Even\nif the time of inflation was a factor of 10 or 100 (instead of 2), the expansion\nfactor of 1030 or more would have blotted out any possibility of observing any-\nthing but a flat universe.\nCMB Uniformity\nInflation also explains why the CMB is so uniform. Without inflation, the tiny\nuniverse at 10-35 s would not have been small enough for all parts of it to\nhave been in contact and so reach the same temperature (information\ncannot travel faster than c). To see this, suppose that the currently observable\nuniverse came from a region of space about 1 cm in diameter at t = 10-36 s,\nas per original Big Bang theory. In that 10-36 s, light could have traveled\nd= ct = (3 × 108 m/s)(10-36 s) = 10-27 m, way too small for the opposite sides\nof a 1-cm-wide "universe" to have been in communication. But if that region had\nbeen 1030 times smaller (= 10-32 m), as proposed by the inflation model, there\ncould have been contact and thermal equilibrium to produce the observed nearly\nuniform CMB. Inflation, by making the very early universe extremely small,\nassures that all parts of that region which is today\'s observable universe could\nhave been in thermal equilibrium. And after inflation the universe could be large\nenough to give us today\'s observable universe.\nGalaxy Seeds, Fluctuations, Magnetic Monopoles\nInflation also gives us a clue as to how the present structure of the universe\n(galaxies and clusters of galaxies) came about. We saw earlier that, according to\nthe uncertainty principle, energy might be not conserved by an amount AE for a\ntime At ~ h/AE. Forces, whether electromagnetic or other types, can undergo such\ntiny quantum fluctuations according to quantum theory, but they are so tiny they\nare not detectable unless magnified in some way. That is what inflation might have\ndone: it could have magnified those fluctuations perhaps 1030 times in size, which\nwould give us the density irregularities seen in the cosmic microwave background\n(WMAP, Fig. 33-26). That would be very nice, because the density variations we\nsee in the CMB are what we believe were the seeds that later coalesced under\ngravity into galaxies and galaxy clusters, and our models fit the data extremely well.\nSometimes it is said that the quantum fluctuations occurred in the vacuum\nstate or vacuum energy. This could be possible because the vacuum is no longer\nconsidered to be empty, as we discussed in Section 32-3 relative to positrons as holes\nin a negative energy sea of electrons. Indeed, the vacuum is thought to be filled\nwith fields and particles occupying all the possible negative energy states.\n974 CHAPTER 33\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 29, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Also, the virtual exchange particles that carry the forces, as discussed in Chapter 32,\ncould leave their brief virtual states and actually become real as a result of the\n1030 magnification of space (according to inflation) and the very short time over\nwhich it occurred (At = h/AE).\nInflation helps us too with the puzzle of why magnetic monopoles (Section 20-1)\nhave never been observed, yet isolated magnetic poles may well have been\ncopiously produced at the start. After inflation, they would have been so far apart\nthat we have never stumbled on one.\nInflation may solve outstanding problems, but we may need new physics to\nunderstand how inflation occurred. Many predictions of inflationary theory have\nbeen confirmed by recent cosmological observations.\n33-9 Dark Matter and Dark Energy\nAccording to the Standard Big Bang Model, the universe is evolving and changing.\nIndividual stars are being created, evolving, and then dying to become white\ndwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. At the same time, the universe as a whole is\nexpanding. One important question is whether the universe will continue to\nexpand forever. Until the late 1990s, the universe was thought to be dominated\nby matter which interacts by gravity, and the fate of the universe was connected\nto the curvature of space-time (Section 33-4). If the universe had negative curvature,\nthe expansion of the universe would never stop, although the rate of expansion\nwould decrease due to the gravitational attraction of its parts. Such a universe\nwould be open and infinite. If the universe is flat (no curvature), it would still be\nopen and infinite but its expansion would slowly approach a zero rate. If\nthe universe had positive curvature, it would be closed and finite; the effect of\ngravity would be strong enough that the expansion would eventually stop and the\nuniverse would begin to contract, collapsing back onto itself in a big crunch.\nCritical Density\nAccording to the above scenario (which does not include inflation or the recently\ndiscovered acceleration of the universe), the fate of the universe would depend\non the average mass-energy density in the universe. For an average mass density\ngreater than a critical value known as the critical density, estimated to be about\nPc ~ 10-26 kg/m3\n(i.e., a few nucleons/m3 on average throughout the universe), space-time would\nhave a positive curvature and gravity would prevent expansion from continuing\nforever. Eventually (if p > pc) gravity would pull the universe back into a big\ncrunch. If instead the actual density was equal to the critical density, p = Pc, the\nuniverse would be flat and open, just barely expanding forever. If the actual\ndensity was less than the critical density, p < Pc, the universe would have nega-\ntive curvature and would easily expand forever. See Fig. 33-31. Today we believe\nthe universe is very close to flat. But recent evidence suggests the universe is\nexpanding at an accelerating rate, as discussed below.\n2\nRelative size of universe\n(or average intergalactic distance)\n1\n0\n-10\nBig Bang\n(lookback time\ndepends on model)\nNegative curvature\nDark energy (acceleration)\np<Pc\nFlat\np=Pc\np>Pc\nPositive curvature\nNow\n10\nBillions of years\n20\n30\n"Big crunch"\nFIGURE 33-31 Three future\npossibilities for the universe,\ndepending on the density p of\nordinary matter, plus a fourth\npossibility that includes dark energy.\nNote that all curves have been\nchosen to have the same slope\n( = H0 , the Hubble parameter) right\nnow.

Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nDark Matter\nWMAP and other experiments have convinced scientists that the universe is flat\nand p = Pc. But this p cannot be only normal baryonic matter (atoms are 99.9%\nbaryons-protons and neutrons-by weight). These recent experiments put the\namount of normal baryonic matter in the universe at only about 5% of the critical\ndensity. What is the other 95%? There is strong evidence for a significant amount\nof nonluminous matter in the universe referred to as dark matter, which acts\nnormally under gravity, but does not absorb or radiate light sufficiently to be visible.\nFor example, observations of the rotation of galaxies suggest that they rotate as\nif they had considerably more mass than we can see. Recall from Chapter 5,\nExample 5-12, that for a satellite of mass m revolving around Earth (mass M)\nm2 = GTM\nand hence v = VGM/r. If we apply this equation to stars in a galaxy, we see\nthat their speed depends on galactic mass. Observations show that stars farther\nfrom the galactic center revolve much faster than expected if there is only the\npull of visible matter, suggesting a great deal of invisible matter. Similarly,\nobservations of the motion of galaxies within clusters also suggest that they have\nconsiderably more mass than can be seen. Furthermore, theory suggests that\nwithout dark matter, galaxies and stars probably would not have formed and\nwould not exist. Dark matter seems to hold the universe together.\nWhat might this nonluminous matter in the universe be? We don\'t know yet.\nBut we hope to find out soon. It cannot be made of ordinary (baryonic) matter,\nso it must consist of some other sort of elementary particle, perhaps created at\na very early time. Perhaps it is made up of previously undetected weakly interacting\nmassive particles (WIMPs), possibly supersymmetric particles (Section 32-12)\nsuch as neutralinos. We are anxiously awaiting the results of intense searches for\nsuch particles, looking both at what arrives from far out in the cosmos with\nunderground detectors1, and by producing them in particle colliders (the LHC,\nSection 32-1).\nDark matter makes up roughly 25% of the mass-energy of the universe,\naccording to the latest observations and models. Thus the total mass-energy is\n25% dark matter plus 5% baryons for a total of about 30%, which does not bring p\nup to pc. What is the other 70%? We are not sure about that either, but we have\ngiven it a name: "dark energy."\nFIGURE 33-32 Saul Perlmutter,\ncenter, flanked by Adam G. Riess\n(left) and Brian P.

Gravity was assumed to be the predominant force on a large scale\nin the universe, and it was thought that the expansion of the universe ought to\nbe slowing down in time because gravity acts as an attractive force between\nobjects. But measurements of Type Ia supernovae (our best standard candles-\nsee Section 33-3) unexpectedly showed that very distant (high z) supernovae\nwere dimmer than expected. That is, given their great distance d as determined\nfrom their low brightness, their speed v as determined from the measured z\nwas less than expected according to Hubble\'s law. This result suggests that\nnearer galaxies are moving away from us relatively faster than those very distant\nones, meaning the expansion of the universe in more recent epochs has sped up.\n*In deep mines and under mountains to block out most other particles.\n976 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 31, 'type': 'text', 'content': "This acceleration in the expansion of the universe (in place of the expected\ndeceleration due to gravitational attraction between masses) seems to have begun\nroughly 7 billion years ago (7 Gyr, which would be about halfway back to what\nwe call the Big Bang).\nWhat could be causing the universe to accelerate in its expansion, against the\nattractive force of gravity? Does our understanding of gravity need to be revised?\nWe don't yet know the answers to these questions. There are several specula-\ntions. Somehow there seems to be a long-range repulsive effect on space, like\na negative gravity, causing objects to speed away from each other ever faster.\nWhatever it is, it has been given the name dark energy. Many scientists say dark\nenergy is the biggest mystery facing physical science today.\nOne idea is a sort of quantum field given the name quintessence. Another\npossibility suggests an energy latent in space itself (vacuum energy) and relates to\nan aspect of General Relativity known as the cosmological constant (symbol A).\nWhen Einstein developed his equations, he found that they offered no solutions\nfor a static universe. In those days (1917) it was thought the universe was static-\nunchanging and everlasting. Einstein added an arbitrary constant (A) to his\nequations to provide solutions for a static universe.+ A decade later, when Hubble\nshowed us an expanding universe, Einstein discarded his cosmological constant as no\nlonger needed (A = 0). But today, measurements are consistent with dark energy\nbeing due to a nonzero cosmological constant, although further measurements are\nneeded to see subtle differences among theories.\nThere is increasing evidence that the effects of some form of dark energy\nare very real. Observations of the CMB, supernovae, and large-scale structure\n(Section 33-10) agree well with theories and computer models when they input\ndark energy as providing about 70% of the mass-energy in the universe, and when\nthe total mass-energy density equals the critical density pc ·\nNormal matter = 5%\nToday's best estimate of how the mass-energy in the universe is distributed\nis approximately (see also Fig. 33-33):\n70% dark energy\n30% matter, subject to the known gravitational force.\nOf this 30%, about\n25% is dark matter\n5% is baryons (what atoms are made of); of this 5% only 1o is readily\nvisible matter-stars and galaxies (that is, 0.5% of the total); the other\n10 of ordinary matter, which is not visible, is mainly gaseous plasma.\nIt is remarkable that only 0.5% of all the mass-energy in the universe is visible as\nstars and galaxies.\nThe idea that the universe is dominated by completely unknown forms of\nmatter and energy seems bizarre. Nonetheless, the ability of our present model\nto precisely explain observations of the CMB anisotropy, cosmic expansion, and\nlarge-scale structure (next Section) presents a compelling case.\nStars and galaxies\nDark\nmatter\n25%\nDark\nenergy\n70%\nFIGURE 33-33 Portions of total\nmass-energy in the universe\n(approximate).\n33-10 Large-Scale Structure of the\nUniverse\nThe beautiful WMAP pictures of the sky (Fig. 33-26) show small but significant\ninhomogeneities in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\nThese anisotropies reflect compressions and expansions in the primordial plasma\njust before decoupling (Fig. 33-29), from which galaxies and clusters of galaxies\nformed. Analyses of the irregularities in the CMB using mammoth computer\n+It seems strange that Einstein and other scientists believed in a static universe. The ancients, including\nthe Roman Lucretius argued against it: If there was no birth-time of earth and heaven and they have\nbeen from everlasting, why before the [Trojan] war .... have not other poets as well sung other themes?\n[The reference is to Homer being the oldest known writings.] The ancient Hebrews also argued for a\nbeginning (like our Big Bang): see Genesis.\nSECTION 33-10 Large-Scale Structure of the Universe 977\n", 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 32, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 33-34 Distribution of some\n50,000 galaxies in a 2.5° slice through almost\nhalf of the sky above the equator, as\nmeasured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS).

These simulations are very successful if they contain\ndark energy and dark matter; and the dark matter needs to be cold (slow\nspeed-think of Eq. 13-8, 2 mv2 = 2kT where T is temperature), rather than\n"hot" dark matter such as neutrinos which move at or very near the speed of\nlight. Indeed, the modern cosmological model is called the ACDM model, where\nlambda (A) stands for the cosmological constant, and CDM is cold dark matter.\nCosmologists have gained substantial confidence in this cosmological model\nfrom such a precise fit between observations and theory. They can also extract\nvery precise values for cosmological parameters which previously were only\nknown with low accuracy. The CMB is such an important cosmological observ-\nable that every effort is being made to extract all of the information it contains.\nA new generation of ground, balloon, and satellite experiments is observing the\nCMB with greater resolution and sensitivity. They may detect interaction of\ngravity waves (produced in the inflationary epoch) with the CMB and thereby\nprovide direct evidence for cosmic inflation, and also provide information about\nelementary particle physics at energies far beyond the reach of man-made\naccelerators and colliders.\n33-11 Finally\nWhen we look up into the night sky, we see stars; and with the best telescopes, we\nsee galaxies and the exotic objects we discussed earlier, including rare supernovae.\nBut even with our best instruments we do not see the processes going on inside\nstars and supernovae that we hypothesized (and believe). We are dependent on\nbrilliant theorists who come up with viable theories and verifiable models. We\ndepend on complicated computer models whose parameters are varied until the\noutputs compare favorably with our observations and analyses of WMAP and\nother experiments. And we now have a surprisingly precise idea about some\naspects of our universe: it is flat, it is about 14 billion years old, it contains only\n5% "normal" baryonic matter (for atoms), and so on.\nThe questions raised by cosmology are difficult and profound, and may seem\nremoved from everyday "reality." We can always say, "the Sun is shining, it\'s\ngoing to shine on for an unimaginably long time, all is well." Nonetheless, the\nquestions of cosmology are deep ones that fascinate the human intellect. One\naspect that is especially intriguing is this: calculations on the formation and\nevolution of the universe have been performed that deliberately varied the\nvalues-just slightly-of certain fundamental physical constants. The result?\n978 CHAPTER 33 Astrophysics and Cosmology\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 33, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'A universe in which life as we know it could not exist. [For example, if the difference\nin mass between a proton and a neutron were zero, or less than the mass of\nthe electron, 0.511 MeV/c2, there would be no atoms: electrons would be\ncaptured by protons to make neutrons.] Such results have contributed to a\nphilosophical idea called the anthropic principle, which says that if the universe\nwere even a little different than it is, we could not be here. We physicists are\ntrying to find out if there are some undiscovered fundamental laws that\ndetermined those conditions that allowed us to exist. A poet might say that the\nuniverse is exquisitely tuned, almost as if to accommodate us.\nSummary\nThe night sky contains myriads of stars including those in the\nMilky Way, which is a "side view" of our Galaxy looking along\nthe plane of the disk. Our Galaxy includes over 1011 stars.\nBeyond our Galaxy are billions of other galaxies.\nAstronomical distances are measured in light-years\n(1 ly ~ 1013 km). The nearest star is about 4 ly away and the\nnearest large galaxy is 2 million ly away. Our Galactic disk has\na diameter of about 100,000 ly. [Distances are sometimes speci-\nfied in parsecs, where 1 parsec = 3.26 ly.]\nStars are believed to begin life as collapsing masses of gas\n(protostars), largely hydrogen. As they contract, they heat up\n(potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy). When the\ntemperature reaches about 10 million degrees, nuclear fusion\nbegins and forms heavier elements (nucleosynthesis), mainly\nhelium at first. The energy released during these reactions\nheats the gas so its outward pressure balances the inward grav-\nitational force, and the young star stabilizes as a main-sequence\nstar. The tremendous luminosity of stars comes from the energy\nreleased during these thermonuclear reactions. After billions\nof years, as helium is collected in the core and hydrogen is used\nup, the core contracts and heats further. The outer envelope\nexpands and cools, and the star becomes a red giant (larger\ndiameter, redder color).\nThe next stage of stellar evolution depends on the mass of\nthe star, which may have lost much of its original mass as its\nouter envelope escaped into space. Stars of residual mass less\nthan about 1.4 solar masses cool further and become white\ndwarfs, eventually fading and going out altogether. Heavier\nstars contract further due to their greater gravity: the density\napproaches nuclear density, the huge pressure forces electrons\nto combine with protons to form neutrons, and the star becomes\nessentially a huge nucleus of neutrons. This is a neutron star,\nand the energy released during its final core collapse is believed\nto produce supernova explosions. If the star is very massive, it\nmay contract even further and form a black hole, which is so\ndense that no matter or light can escape from it.\nIn the general theory of relativity, the equivalence principle\nstates that an observer cannot distinguish acceleration from a\ngravitational field. Said another way, gravitational and inertial\nmasses are the same. The theory predicts gravitational bending\nof light rays to a degree consistent with experiment. Gravity\nis treated as a curvature in space and time, the curvature being\ngreater near massive objects. The universe as a whole may be\ncurved. With sufficient mass, the curvature of the universe\nwould be positive, and the universe is closed and finite; other-\nwise, it would be open and infinite. Today we believe the\nuniverse is flat.\nDistant galaxies display a redshift in their spectral lines,\noriginally interpreted as a Doppler shift. The universe is\nobserved to be expanding, its galaxies racing away from each\nother at speeds (v) proportional to the distance (d) between\nthem:\nv = H0d,\n(33-4)\nwhich is known as Hubble\'s law (Ho is the Hubble parameter).\nThis expansion of the universe suggests an explosive origin,\nthe Big Bang, which occurred about 13.8 billion years ago. It is\nnot like an ordinary explosion, but rather an expansion of\nspace itself.\nThe cosmological principle assumes that the universe, on\na large scale, is homogeneous and isotropic.\nImportant evidence for the Big Bang model of the universe\nwas the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radia-\ntion (CMB), which conforms to a blackbody radiation curve at\na temperature of 2.725 K.\nThe Standard Model of the Big Bang provides a possible\nscenario as to how the universe developed as it expanded and\ncooled after the Big Bang. Starting at 10-43 seconds after the\nBig Bang, according to this model, the universe underwent a\nbrief but rapid exponential expansion, referred to as inflation.\nShortly thereafter, quarks were confined into hadrons\n(the hadron era). About 10-4 s after the Big Bang, the majority\nof hadrons disappeared, having combined with anti-hadrons,\nproducing photons, leptons, and energy, leaving mainly photons\nand leptons to freely move, thus introducing the lepton era.\nBy the time the universe was about 10 s old, the electrons too\nhad mostly disappeared, having combined with their antiparticles;\nthe universe was radiation-dominated. A couple of minutes\nlater, nucleosynthesis began, but lasted only a few minutes. It\nthen took almost four hundred thousand years before the uni-\nverse was cool enough for electrons to combine with nuclei to\nform atoms (recombination). Photons, up to then continually\nbeing scattered off of free electrons, could now move freely-\nthey were decoupled from matter and the universe became\ntransparent. The background radiation had expanded and\ncooled so much that its total energy became less than the\nenergy in matter, and matter dominated increasingly over\nradiation. Then stars and galaxies formed, producing a universe\nnot much different than it is today-some 14 billion years later.\nRecent observations indicate that the universe is essentially\nflat, that it contains an as-yet unknown type of dark matter,\nand that it is dominated by a mysterious dark energy which\nexerts a sort of negative gravity causing the expansion of the\nuniverse to accelerate. The total contributions of baryonic\n(normal) matter, dark matter, and dark energy sum up to the\ncritical density.\nSummary 979\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'page_number': 34, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Questions\n1.

Estimate the mass of our observable universe using the\nfollowing assumptions: Our universe is spherical in shape,\nit has been expanding at the speed of light since the Big\nBang, and its density is the critical density.\n4. When stable nuclei first formed, about 3 minutes after the\nBig Bang, there were about 7 times more protons than\nneutrons. Explain how this leads to a ratio of the mass of\nhydrogen to the mass of helium of 3:1. This is about the\nactual ratio observed in the universe.\n5. We cannot use Hubble\'s law to measure the distances to\nnearby galaxies, because their random motions are larger\nthan the overall expansion. Indeed, the closest galaxy to\nus, the Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years away, is\napproaching us at a speed of about 130 km/s. (a) What is\nthe shift in wavelength of the 656-nm line of hydrogen\nemitted from the Andromeda Galaxy, as seen by us? (b) Is\nthis a redshift or a blueshift? (c) Ignoring the expansion,\nhow soon will it and the Milky Way Galaxy collide?\nANSWERS TO EXERCISES\nA: Our Earth and ourselves, 2 years ago.\nC: 30 km.\nB: 600 ly (estimating L from Fig. 33-6 as L ~ 8 × 1026 w;\nnote that on a log scale, 6000 K is closer to 7000 K than it\nD: (a); not the usual R3, but R: see formula for the\nSchwarzschild radius.\nis to 5000 K).\nE: (c); (d).\nSearch and Learn 983\n', 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'type': 'table', 'content': [{'row_index': 0, 'column_index': 0, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 0, 'column_index': 2, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 1, 'column_index': 0, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 1, 'column_index': 1, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 1, 'column_index': 2, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 2, 'column_index': 0, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 2, 'column_index': 1, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 2, 'column_index': 2, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 3, 'column_index': 0, 'content': '11.9 :selected:'}, {'row_index': 3, 'column_index': 1, 'content': '8.8'}, {'row_index': 3, 'column_index': 2, 'content': ''}], 'chapter_title': '33-4 General Relativity: Gravity and the Curvature of Space'}, {'type': 'table', 'content': [{'row_index': 0, 'column_index': 0, 'content': 'Table 33-1'}, {'row_index': 0, 'column_index': 1, 'content': 'Astronomical Distances'}, {'row_index': 1, 'column_index': 0, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 2, 'column_index': 0, 'content': 'Object'}, {'row_index': 2, 'column_index': 1, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 2, 'column_index': 2, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 2, 'column_index': 3, 'content': ''}, {'row_index': 2, 'column_index': 4, 'content': 'Approx.
