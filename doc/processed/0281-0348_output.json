Pressure in a fluid\nincreases with depth, a fact that allows less dense objects to float-the pressure\nunderneath is higher than on top. When fluids flow, such as water or air, interesting\neffects occur because the pressure in the fluid is lower where the fluid velocity is higher\n(Bernoulli\'s principle).\nThe great mass of a glacier\'s ice (photos here) moves slowly, like a viscous liquid. The\ndark lines are "moraines," made up of rock broken off mountain walls by the moving ice,\nand represent streamlines. The two photos, taken in 1929 and 2009 by Italian expeditions\nto the mountain K2 (on the right in the distance), show the same glacier has become less\nthick, presumably due to global warming.\nFluids\nCHAPTER-OPENING QUESTIONS-Guess now!\n1.

We\nsometimes treated objects as point particles. Now we are going to shift our\nattention to materials that are very deformable and can flow. Such "fluids" include\nliquids and gases. We will examine fluids both at rest (fluid statics) and in motion\n(fluid dynamics).\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': '10-1 Phases of Matter\nThe three common phases, or states, of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. A simple\nway to distinguish these three phases is as follows. A solid maintains a generally\nfixed size and shape; usually it requires a large force to change the volume or\nshape of a solid* (although a thin object might bend). A liquid does not maintain\na fixed shape-it takes on the shape of its container, and it can flow; but like a solid\nit is not readily compressible, and its volume can be changed significantly only by a\nvery large force. A gas has neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume-it will expand\nto fill its container. For example, when air is pumped into an automobile tire, the\nair does not all run to the bottom of the tire as a liquid would; it spreads out to fill\nthe whole volume of the tire.\nBecause liquids and gases do not maintain a fixed shape, they both have the\nability to flow. They are thus referred to collectively as fluids.\nThe division of matter into three phases is not always simple. How, for example,\nshould butter be classified? Furthermore, a fourth phase of matter can be distin-\nguished, the plasma phase, which occurs only at very high temperatures and consists\nof ionized atoms (electrons separated from the nuclei). Some scientists believe that\ncolloids (suspensions of tiny particles in a liquid) should also be considered a separate\nphase of matter. Liquid crystals, used in TV, cell phone, and computer screens,\ncan be considered a phase of matter in between solids and liquids. For now, we\nwill be interested in the three ordinary phases of matter.\n10-2 Density and Specific Gravity\nIt is sometimes said that iron is "heavier" than wood. This cannot really be true\nsince a large log clearly weighs more than an iron nail. What we should say is that\niron is more dense than wood.\nThe density, p, of a substance (p is the lowercase Greek letter rho) is defined\nas its mass per unit volume:\nm\np = ",\n(10-1)\nV\nwhere m is the mass of a sample of the substance and Vits volume. Density is a char-\nacteristic property of any pure substance. Objects made of a particular pure substance,\nsuch as pure gold, can have any size or mass, but the density will be the same for each.\nWe can use the concept of density, Eq. 10-1, to write the mass of an object as\nm = pV,\nand the weight of an object as\nmg = pVg.\nThe SI unit for density is kg/m3. Sometimes densities are given in g/cm3.\nNote that a density given in g/cm3 must be multiplied by 1000 to give the result\nin kg/m3 [1 kg/m3 = 1000 g/(100 cm)3 = 103 g/106 cm3 = 10-3 g/cm3]. For\nexample, the density of aluminum is p = 2.70 g/cm3, which equals 2700 kg/m3.\nThe densities of various substances are given in Table 10-1. The Table specifies\ntemperature and atmospheric pressure because they affect density (the effect is\nslight for liquids and solids). Note that air is about 1000 times less dense than water.\nEXAMPLE 10-1\nMass, given volume and density. What is the mass of a\nsolid iron wrecking ball of radius 18 cm?\nAPPROACH First we use the standard formula V = Tr3 (see inside rear cover)\nto obtain the sphere\'s volume. Then Eq. 10-1 and Table 10-1 give us the mass m.\nSOLUTION The volume of the sphere is\nV=Tr3 = $(3.14)(0.18 m)3 = 0.024 m3.\nFrom Table 10-1, the density of iron is p = 7800 kg/m3, so Eq. 10-1 gives\nm = pV = (7800 kg/m3)(0.024 m3) = 190 kg.\nTABLE 10-1\nDensities of Substances+\nSubstance\nDensity,\np (kg/m3)\nSolids\nAluminum\n2.70 × 103\nIron and steel\n7.8 × 103\nCopper\n8.9 × 103\nLead\n11.3\n× 103\nGold\n19.3\n× 103\nConcrete\n2.3\n< 103\nGranite\n2.7 × 103\nWood (typical)\n0.3-0.9× 103\nGlass, common\n2.4-2.8 × 103\nIce (H2O)\n0.917 × 103\nBone\n1.7-2.0 × 103\nLiquids\nWater (4℃)\n1.000 × 103\nSea water\n1.025 × 103\nBlood, plasma\n1.03 × 103\nBlood, whole\n1.05 × 103\nMercury\n13.6 × 103\nAlcohol, ethyl\n0.79 × 103\nGasoline\n0.7-0.8× 103\nGases\nAir\n1.29\nHelium\n0.179\nCarbon dioxide\n1.98\nWater (steam)\n0.598\n(100℃)\n*Densities are given at 0℃ and 1 atm\npressure unless otherwise specified.\nSection 9-5.\nSECTION 10-2 Density and Specific Gravity 261\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CAUTION\nPressure is a scalar, not a vector\nFIGURE 10-1 Pressure is the same\nin every direction in a nonmoving\nfluid at a given depth. If this weren\'t\ntrue, the fluid would be in motion.\nFIGURE 10-2 If there were a\ncomponent of force parallel to the\nsolid surface of the container, the\nliquid would move in response to it.\nFor a liquid at rest, Fy = 0.\nF\nF\nThe specific gravity of a substance is defined as the ratio of the density\nof that substance to the density of water at 4.0°℃. Because specific gravity\n(abbreviated SG) is a ratio, it is a simple number without dimensions or\nunits. For example (see Table 10-1), the specific gravity of lead is 11.3\n[(11.3× 103 kg/m3)/(1.00 × 103 kg/m3)]. The SG of alcohol is 0.79.\nThe concepts of density and specific gravity are especially helpful in the study\nof fluids because we are not always dealing with a fixed volume or mass.\n10-3 Pressure in Fluids\nPressure and force are related, but they are not the same thing. Pressure is defined\nas force per unit area, where the force F is understood to be the magnitude of\nthe force acting perpendicular to the surface area A:\ne = P = 4\nF\n(10-2)\nAlthough force is a vector, pressure is a scalar. Pressure has magnitude only. The\nSI unit of pressure is N/m2. This unit has the official name pascal (Pa), in honor\nof Blaise Pascal (see Section 10-5); that is, 1 Pa = 1 N/m2. However, for simplic-\nity, we will often use N/m2. Other units sometimes used are dynes/cm2, and\nlb/in.2 (pounds per square inch, abbreviated "psi"). Several other units for pressure\nare discussed in Sections 10-4 and 10-6, along with conversions between them\n(see also the Table inside the front cover).\nEXAMPLE 10-2\nCalculating pressure. A 60-kg person\'s two feet cover\nan area of 500 cm2. (a) Determine the pressure exerted by the two feet on the\nground. (b) If the person stands on one foot, what will be the pressure under\nthat foot?\nAPPROACH Assume the person is at rest. Then the ground pushes up on her\nwith a force equal to her weight mg, and she exerts a force mg on the ground\nwhere her feet (or foot) contact it. Because 1 cm2 = (10-2 m)2 = 10-4 m2, then\n500 cm2 = 0.050 m2.\nSOLUTION (a) The pressure on the ground exerted by the two feet is\nP = = = mg =\nA\n(0.050 m2)\n(60 kg) (9.8 m/s2)\n= 12 × 103 N/m2.\n(b) If the person stands on one foot, the force is still equal to the person\'s\nweight, but the area will be half as much, so the pressure will be twice as much:\n24 × 103 N/m2.\nPressure is particularly useful for dealing with fluids. It is an experimental\nobservation that a fluid exerts pressure in every direction. This is well known to\nswimmers and divers who feel the water pressure on all parts of their bodies. At\nany depth in a fluid at rest, the pressure is the same in all directions at that given\ndepth. To see why, consider a tiny cube of the fluid (Fig. 10-1) which is so small\nthat we can consider it a point and can ignore the force of gravity on it. The pres-\nsure on one side of it must equal the pressure on the opposite side. If this weren\'t\ntrue, there would be a net force on the cube and it would start moving. If the fluid\nis not flowing, then the pressures must be equal.\nFor a fluid at rest, the force due to fluid pressure always acts perpendicular\nto any solid surface it touches. If there were a component of the force parallel\nto the surface, as shown in Fig. 10-2, then according to Newton\'s third law the\nsolid surface would exert a force back on the fluid, which would cause the fluid to\nflow-in contradiction to our assumption that the fluid is at rest. Thus the force\ndue to the pressure in a fluid at rest is always perpendicular to the surface.\n262 CHAPTER 10 Fluids\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'We now calculate quantitatively how the pressure in a liquid of uniform den-\nsity varies with depth. Let us look at a depth h below the surface of the liquid as\nshown in Fig. 10-3 (that is, the liquid\'s top surface is a height h above this level). The\npressure due to the liquid at this depth h is due to the weight of the column of\nliquid above it. Thus the force due to the weight of liquid acting on the area A is\nF= mg = (pV)g = pAhg, where Ah is the volume of the column of liquid,\np is the density of the liquid (assumed to be constant), and g is the acceleration\nof gravity. The pressure P due to the weight of liquid is then\nP = = PAhg\nA\nP = pgh.\n[liquid] (10-3a)\nh\nA\nFIGURE 10-3 Calculating the\npressure at a depth h in a liquid, due\nto the weight of the liquid above.\nNote that the area A doesn\'t affect the pressure at a given depth. The fluid pres-\nsure is directly proportional to the density of the liquid and to the depth within the\nliquid. In general, the pressure at equal depths within a uniform liquid is the same.\n-\nEXERCISE A Return to Chapter-Opening Question 1, page 260, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nEquation 10-3a is extremely useful. It is valid for fluids whose density is\nconstant and does not change with depth-that is, if the fluid is incompressible.\nThis is usually a good approximation for liquids (although at great depths in the\nocean, the density of water is increased some by compression due to the\ngreat weight of water above).\nIf the density of a fluid does vary, a useful relation can be found by considering a\nthin horizontal slab of the fluid of thickness Ah = h2 - h1. The pressure on the\ntop of the slab, at depth h1, is P1 = pgh1 . The pressure on the bottom of the slab\n(pushing upward), at depth h2, is P2 = pgh2. The difference in pressure is\nΔΡ = P2 - P1 = ps(h2 - h1)\nor\nΔΡ = pg Δh.\n[p ~ constant over △h] (10-3b)\nEquation 10-3b tells us how the pressure changes over a small change in depth (Ah)\nwithin a fluid, even if compressible.\nGases are very compressible, and density can vary significantly with depth.\nFor this more general case, in which p may vary, we need to use Eq. 10-3b where\nAh should be small if p varies significantly with depth (or height).\nEXAMPLE 10-3\nPressure at a faucet. The surface of the water in a storage\ntank is 30 m above a water faucet in the kitchen of a house, Fig. 10-4. Calcu-\nlate the difference in water pressure between the faucet and the surface of the\nwater in the tank.\nAPPROACH Water is practically incompressible, so p is constant even for a\nAh = 30 m when used in Eq. 10-3b. Only Ah matters; we can ignore the\n"route" of the pipe and its bends.\nSOLUTION We assume the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the water in\nthe storage tank is the same as at the faucet. So, the water pressure difference\nbetween the faucet and the surface of the water in the tank is\nAP = pg Ah = (1.0 × 103 kg/m3)(9.8 m/s2)(30m) = 2.9 × 105N/m2.\nNOTE The height Ah is sometimes called the pressure head. In this Example,\nthe head of water is 30 m at the faucet. The very different diameters of the tank\nand faucet don\'t affect the result-only height does.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nWater supply\nFIGURE 10-4 Example 10-3.\nAh =\n30 m\nEXERCISE B A dam holds back a lake that is 85 m deep at the dam.

But\nthe Earth's atmosphere is somewhat complicated: not only does the density of air\nvary greatly with altitude but there is no distinct top surface to the atmosphere\nfrom which h (in Eq. 10-3a) could be measured. We can, however, calculate the\napproximate difference in pressure between two altitudes above Earth's surface\nusing Eq. 10-3b.\nThe pressure of the air at a given place varies slightly according to the weather.\nAt sea level, the pressure of the atmosphere on average is 1.013 × 105 N/m2\n(or 14.7 lb/in.2). This value lets us define a commonly used unit of pressure, the\natmosphere (abbreviated atm):\n1 atm = 1.013 × 105 N/m2 = 101.3 kPa.\nAnother unit of pressure sometimes used (in meteorology and on weather maps)\nis the bar, which is defined as\n1 bar = 1.000 × 105 N/m2.\nThus standard atmospheric pressure is slightly more than 1 bar.\nThe pressure due to the weight of the atmosphere is exerted on all objects\nimmersed in this great sea of air, including our bodies. How does a human body\nwithstand the enormous pressure on its surface? The answer is that living cells\nmaintain an internal pressure that closely equals the external pressure, just as\nthe pressure inside a balloon closely matches the outside pressure of the atmos-\nphere. An automobile tire, because of its rigidity, can maintain internal pressures\nmuch greater than the external pressure.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 10-4\nFinger holds water in a straw. You insert\na straw of length l into a tall glass of water. You place your finger over the top\nof the straw, capturing some air above the water but preventing any additional air\nfrom getting in or out, and then you lift the straw from the water. You find that\nthe straw retains most of the water (Fig. 10-5a). Does the air in the space between\nyour finger and the top of the water have a pressure P that is greater than, equal\nto, or less than, the atmospheric pressure P0 outside the straw?\nRESPONSE Consider the forces on the column of water (Fig. 10-5b). Atmospheric\npressure outside the straw pushes upward on the water at the bottom of the straw,\ngravity pulls the water downward, and the air pressure inside the top of the\nstraw pushes downward on the water. Since the water is in equilibrium, the\nupward force due to atmospheric pressure P0 must balance the two downward\nforces. The only way this is possible is for the air pressure P inside the straw at the\ntop to be less than the atmosphere pressure outside the straw. (When you initially\nremove the straw from the water glass, a little water may leave the bottom of\nthe straw, thus increasing the volume of trapped air and reducing its density\nand pressure.)\nGauge Pressure\nIt is important to note that tire gauges, and most other pressure gauges, register the\npressure above and beyond atmospheric pressure. This is called gauge pressure.\nThus, to get the absolute pressure, P, we must add the atmospheric pressure, P0 ,\nto the gauge pressure, PG :\nP = PG + Po -\nIf a tire gauge registers 220 kPa, the absolute pressure within the tire is\n220 kPa + 101 kPa = 321 kPa, equivalent to about 3.2 atm (2.2 atm gauge\npressure).\n264 CHAPTER 10 Fluids\n", 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': '10-5 Pascal\'s Principle\nThe Earth\'s atmosphere exerts a pressure on all objects with which it is in con-\ntact, including other fluids. External pressure acting on a fluid is transmitted\nthroughout that fluid. For instance, according to Eq. 10-3a, the pressure due to\nthe water at a depth of 100 m below the surface of a lake is P = pg Ah =\n(1000 kg/m3)(9.8 m/s2)(100 m) = 9.8 × 105 N/m2, or 9.7 atm. However, the\ntotal pressure at this point is due to the pressure of water plus the pressure of\nthe air above it. Hence the total pressure (if the lake is near sea level) is\n9.7 atm + 1.0 atm = 10.7 atm. This is just one example of a general principle\nattributed to the French philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662).\nPascal\'s principle states that if an external pressure is applied to a confined fluid,\nthe pressure at every point within the fluid increases by that amount.\nA number of practical devices make use of Pascal\'s principle. One example is\nthe hydraulic lift, illustrated in Fig. 10-6a, in which a small input force is used to\nexert a large output force by making the area of the output piston larger than the area\nof the input piston. To see how this works, we assume the input and output pis-\ntons are at the same height (at least approximately). Then the external input\nforce Fin, by Pascal\'s principle, increases the pressure equally throughout.\nTherefore, at the same level (see Fig. 10-6a),\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHydraulic lift\nPout = Pin\nwhere the input quantities are represented by the subscript "in" and the output\nby "out." Since P = F/A, we write the above equality as\n=\nFin\nA¡n\nAout\nFout\nor\nFout\nFin\nAout\n=\nAin\nThe quantity Fout/ Fin is called the mechanical advantage of the hydraulic lift, and\nit is equal to the ratio of the areas. For example, if the area of the output piston\nis 20 times that of the input cylinder, the force is multiplied by a factor of 20.\nThus a force of 200 lb could lift a 4000-lb car.\nFIGURE 10-6 Applications of Pascal\'s principle: (a) hydraulic lift;\n(b) hydraulic brakes in a car.\nMaster\ncylinder\nB\nout\nLF\nin\nPedal\nAout\nPout\nBrake\ncylinder\nBrake\npads\n(a)\n(b)\nDisk,\nattached to wheel\nFigure 10-6b illustrates the brake system of a car.

The simplest is the open-tube manometer (Fig. 10-7a) which is a\nU-shaped tube partially filled with a liquid, usually mercury or water. The pres-\nsure P being measured is related (by Eq. 10-3b) to the difference in height Ah\nof the two levels of the liquid by the relation\nP = Po + pg Ah,\n[manometer] (10-3c)\nwhere P0 is atmospheric pressure (acting on the top of the liquid in the left-hand\ntube), and p is the density of the liquid. Note that the quantity pg Ah is the gauge\npressure-the amount by which P exceeds atmospheric pressure Po . If the liquid\nin the left-hand column were lower than that in the right-hand column, P would\nhave to be less than atmospheric pressure (and Ah would be negative).\nInstead of calculating the product pg Ah, sometimes only the change in height Ah\nis specified. In fact, pressures are sometimes specified as so many "millimeters\nof mercury" (mm-Hg) or "mm of water" (mm-H2O). The unit mm-Hg is equivalent\nto a pressure of 133 N/m2, because pg Ah for 1 mm (= 1.0 × 10-3 m) of mercury\ngives\npg Ah = (13.6 × 103 kg/m3)(9.80 m/s2)(1.00 × 10-3 m)\n= 1.33 × 102 N/m2.\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nUse SI unit in calculations:\n1 Pa = 1N/m2\nThe unit mm-Hg is also called the torr in honor of Evangelista Torricelli\n(1608-1647), a student of Galileo\'s who invented the barometer (see top of next\npage). Conversion factors among the various units of pressure (an incredible\nnuisance!) are given in Table 10-2. It is important that only N/m2 = Pa, the\nproper SI unit, be used in calculations involving other quantities specified in\nSI units.\nAnother type of pressure gauge is the aneroid gauge (Fig. 10-7b) in which\nthe pointer is linked to the flexible ends of an evacuated thin metal chamber. In\nelectronic gauges, the pressure may be applied to a thin metal diaphragm\nwhose resulting deformation is translated into an electrical signal by a transducer.\nA common tire gauge uses a spring, as shown in Fig. 10-7c.\n266 CHAPTER 10 Fluids\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': "TABLE 10-2 Conversion Factors Between Different Units of Pressure\nIn Terms of 1 Pa = 1N/m2\n1 atm in Different Units\n1 atm = 1.013 × 105 N/m2\n= 1.013 × 105 Pa = 101.3 kPa\n1 atm = 1.013 × 105 N/m2\n1 bar = 1.000 × 105 N/m2\n1 atm = 1.013 bar\n1 dyne/cm2 = 0.1 N/m2\n1 atm = 1.013 × 106 dyne/cm2\n1 lb/in.2 = 6.90 × 103 N/m2\n1 atm = 14.7 1b/in.2\n1 lb/ft2 = 47.9 N/m2\n1 atm = 2.12 × 103 1b/ft2\n1 cm-Hg = 1.33 × 103 N/m2\n1 atm = 76.0 cm-Hg\n1 mm-Hg = 133 N/m2\n1 atm = 760 mm-Hg\n1 torr = 133 N/m2\n1 atm = 760 torr\n1 mm-H2O (4℃) = 9.80 N/m2\n1 atm = 1.03 × 104 mm-H2O (4℃)\n~ 10 m of water\nAtmospheric pressure can be measured by a modified kind of mercury\nmanometer with one end closed, called a mercury barometer (Fig. 10-8). The\nglass tube is completely filled with mercury and then inverted into the bowl of\nmercury. If the tube is long enough, the level of the mercury will drop, leaving a\nvacuum at the top of the tube, since atmospheric pressure can support a column\nof mercury only about 76 cm high (exactly 76.0 cm at standard atmospheric pres-\nsure). That is, a column of mercury 76 cm high exerts the same pressure as the\natmosphere *:\nP = pg Ah\n= (13.6× 103 kg/m3)(9.80 m/s2)(0.760m) = 1.013 ×105N/m2 = 1.00 atm.\nHousehold barometers are usually of the aneroid type (Fig. 10-7b), either mechan-\nical (with dial) or electronic.\nA calculation similar to that just done will show that atmospheric pressure\ncan maintain a column of water 10.3 m high in a tube whose top is under vacuum\n(Fig. 10-9). No matter how good a vacuum pump is, water cannot be made to\nrise more than about 10 m under normal atmospheric pressure. To pump water\nout of deep mine shafts with a vacuum pump requires multiple stages for depths\ngreater than 10 m. Galileo studied this problem, and his student Torricelli was\nthe first to explain it. The point is that a pump does not really suck water up a\ntube-it merely reduces the pressure at the top of the tube. Atmospheric air\npressure pushes the water up the tube if the top end is at low pressure (under a\nvacuum), just as it is air pressure that pushes (or maintains) the mercury 76 cm\nhigh in a barometer. [Force pumps, Section 10-14, can push higher.]\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 10-5\nSuction. A novice engineer proposes suc-\ntion cup shoes for space shuttle astronauts working on the exterior of a spacecraft.\nHaving just studied this Chapter, you gently remind him of the fallacy of this\nplan. What is it?\nRESPONSE Suction cups work by pushing out the air underneath the cup.\nWhat holds the suction cup in place is the air pressure outside it. (This can be\na substantial force when on Earth. For example, a 10-cm-diameter suction\ncup has an area of 7.9 × 10-3 m2. The force of the atmosphere on it is\n(7.9 × 10-3 m2)(1.0 × 105N/m2) ~ 800 N, about 180 lbs!) But in outer space,\nthere is no air pressure to push the suction cup onto the spacecraft.\nWe sometimes mistakenly think of suction as something we actively do. For\nexample, we intuitively think that we pull the soda up through a straw. Instead,\nwhat we do is lower the pressure at the top of the straw, and the atmosphere pushes\nthe soda up the straw.\n*This calculation confirms the entry in Table 10-2, 1 atm = 76.0 cm-Hg.\nP = 0\n1\n76.0 cm\nP = 1 atm\nFIGURE 10-8 A mercury barometer,\ninvented by Torricelli, is shown here\nwhen the air pressure is standard\natmospheric, 76.0 cm-Hg.\nFIGURE 10-9 A water barometer:\na full tube of water (longer than 10 m),\nclosed at the top, is inserted into a\ntub of water.

For example, a large rock that you would have difficulty lifting off the\nground can often be easily lifted from the bottom of a stream. When you lift\nthe rock through the surface of the water, it suddenly seems to be much heavier.\nMany objects, such as wood, float on the surface of water. These are two exam-\nples of buoyancy. In each example, the force of gravity is acting downward. But\nin addition, an upward buoyant force is exerted by the liquid. The buoyant\nforce on fish and underwater divers almost exactly balances the force of gravity\ndownward, and allows them to "hover" in equilibrium.\nThe buoyant force occurs because the pressure in a fluid increases with depth.\nThus the upward pressure on the bottom surface of a submerged object is greater\nthan the downward pressure on its top surface. To see this effect, consider a cylin-\nder of height Ah whose top and bottom ends have an area A and which is com-\npletely submerged in a fluid of density PF, as shown in Fig. 10-10. The\nfluid exerts a pressure P1 = PFgh1 at the top surface of the cylinder (Eq. 10-3a).\nFIGURE 10-10 Determination of\nthe buoyant force.\nh\nF1\nh2\nA\n*\n1\nAh = h2 - h1\nB\nPR\nThe force due to this pressure on top of the cylinder is F1 = P A = PFgh1 A,\nand it is directed downward. Similarly, the fluid exerts an upward force on the\nbottom of the cylinder equal to F2 = P2 A = PFgh2 A. The net force on the cylin-\nder exerted by the fluid pressure, which is the buoyant force, FB , acts upward and\nhas the magnitude\nFB = F2 - F1 = PFgA(h2 - h1)\n= PF gA Ah\n= PF Vg\n= MF g,\nwhere V = A Ah is the volume of the cylinder; the product pp V is the mass of\nthe fluid displaced, and pr Vg = mpg is the weight of fluid which takes up a\nvolume equal to the volume of the cylinder. Thus the buoyant force on the cylin-\nder is equal to the weight of fluid displaced by the cylinder.\nThis result is valid no matter what the shape of the object. Its discovery is\ncredited to Archimedes (287 ?- 212 B.C.), and it is called Archimedes\' principle:\nthe buoyant force on an object immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of\nthe fluid displaced by that object.\nBy "fluid displaced," we mean a volume of fluid equal to the submerged\nvolume of the object (or that part of the object that is submerged). If the object is\nplaced in a glass or tub initially filled to the brim with water, the water that flows\nover the top represents the water displaced by the object.\n268 CHAPTER 10 Fluids\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': "B\nB\nB\nB\n1\nD\nD'\nT\nFIGURE 10-11\nArchimedes' principle.\nB\n(a)\nm\ng\n(b)\nmʹğ\nWe can derive Archimedes' principle in general by the following simple but\nelegant argument. The irregularly shaped object D shown in Fig. 10-11a is acted\non by the force of gravity (its weight, mg, downward) and the buoyant force, FB,\nupward. We wish to determine FB. To do so, we next consider a body (D' in\nFig. 10-11b), this time made of the fluid itself, with the same shape and size as the\noriginal object, and located at the same depth. You might think of this body of\nfluid as being separated from the rest of the fluid by an imaginary membrane.\nThe buoyant force FB on this body of fluid will be exactly the same as that on the\noriginal object since the surrounding fluid, which exerts FB , is in exactly the same\nconfiguration. This body of fluid D' is in equilibrium (the fluid as a whole is at rest).\nTherefore, FB = m'g, where m'g is the weight of the body of fluid D'. Hence the\nbuoyant force FB is equal to the weight of the body of fluid whose volume equals\nthe volume of the original submerged object, which is Archimedes' principle.\nArchimedes' discovery was made by experiment. What we have done is show\nthat Archimedes' principle can be derived from Newton's laws.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 10-6\nTwo pails of water. Consider two iden-\ntical pails of water filled to the brim. One pail contains only water, the other has\na piece of wood floating in it. Which pail has the greater weight?\nRESPONSE Both pails weigh the same. Recall Archimedes' principle: the wood\ndisplaces a volume of water with weight equal to the weight of the wood. Some\nwater will overflow the pail, but Archimedes' principle tells us the spilled water\nhas weight equal to the weight of the wood; so the pails have the same weight.\nEXAMPLE 10-7\nRecovering a submerged statue. A 70-kg ancient statue\nlies at the bottom of the sea. Its volume is 3.0 × 104 cm3. How much force is\nneeded to lift it (without acceleration)?\nAPPROACH The force F needed to lift the statue is equal to the statue's\nweight mg minus the buoyant force FB .

The weight of\nthe statue is mg = (70 kg)(9.8 m/s2) = 6.9 × 102 N. Hence the force F needed\nto lift it is 690 N - 300 N = 390 N. It is as if the statue had a mass of only\n(390 N)/(9.8 m/s2) = 40 kg.\nNOTE Here F = 390 N is the force needed to lift the statue without accelera-\ntion when it is under water.

However, if the object is weighed in air (= w) and also "weighed"\nwhile it is under water (= w\'), the density can be determined using Archimedes\'\nprinciple, as the following Example shows. The quantity w\' is called the apparent\nweight in water, and is what a scale reads when the object is submerged in water\n(see Fig. 10-13); w\' equals the true weight (w = mg) minus the buoyant force.\nEXAMPLE 10-8\nArchimedes: Is the crown gold? When a crown of mass\n14.7 kg is submerged in water, an accurate scale reads only 13.4 kg.

By\nNewton\'s third law, w\' equals the force FT that the scale exerts on the crown in\nFig. 10-13b. The sum of the forces on the crown is zero, so w\' equals the actual\nweight w (= mg) minus the buoyant force FB :\nSO\nw\' = FT = W - FB\nw - w\' = FB .\nLet V be the volume of the completely submerged object and po the object\'s\ndensity (so po V is its mass), and let pp be the density of the fluid (water).

In\ngeneral, an object floats on a fluid if its density (po) is less than that of the fluid (PF).\nThis is readily seen from Fig. 10-14a, where a submerged log of mass mo will\nexperience a net upward force and float to the surface if FB > mog; that is, if\nPF Vg > po Vg or PF > Po. At equilibrium-that is, when floating-the buoyant\nforce on an object has magnitude equal to the weight of the object. For example,\na log whose specific gravity is 0.60 and whose volume is 2.0 m3 has a mass\nmo = Po V = (0.60 × 103 kg/m3)(2.0 m3) = 1200 kg.\nIf the log is fully submerged, it will displace a mass of water\nMF = PFV = (1000 kg/m3)(2.0 m3) = 2000 kg.\nHence the buoyant force on the log will be greater than its weight, and it will\nfloat upward to the surface (Fig. 10-14). The log will come to equilibrium\nwhen it displaces 1200 kg of water, which means that 1.2 m3 of its volume\nwill be submerged. This 1.2 m3 corresponds to 60% of the volume of the log\n(= 1.2/2.0 = 0.60), so 60% of the log is submerged.\nIn general when an object floats, we have FB = mO g, which we can write as\n(see Fig. 10-15)\nFB = mO g\nPF Vdispl g = PoVog,\nwhere VO is the full volume of the object and Vdispl is the volume of fluid it\ndisplaces (= volume submerged).

The fraction of the hydrometer sub-\nmerged (Vdisplaced/Vtotal) is equal to the density ratio p/ PH2O ·\nSOLUTION The hydrometer has an overall density\np =\nV\nm\n=\n45.0 g\n= 0.900 g/cm3.\n(2.00 cm2)(25.0 cm)\nThus, when placed in water, it will come to equilibrium when 0.900 of its volume\nis submerged. Since it is of uniform cross section, (0.900)(25.0 cm) = 22.5 cm\nof its length will be submerged. The specific gravity of water is defined to be\n1.000, so the mark should be placed 22.5 cm from the weighted end.\nNOTE Hydrometers can be used to measure the density of liquids like car\nantifreeze coolant, car battery acid (a measure of its charge), wine fermenting\nin casks, and many others.\nEXERCISE C Which of the following objects, submerged in water, experiences the largest\nmagnitude of the buoyant force?

Some interesting calculations can be done using\nvery simple models, which we consider in the Problems at the end of the Chapter.\nAir is a fluid, and it too exerts a buoyant force. Ordinary objects weigh less\nin air than they do in a vacuum. Because the density of air is so small, the effect for\nordinary solids is slight.

A rowboat\ncarrying a large granite rock floats in a small lake. If the rock (SG ~ 3, Table 10-1)\nis thrown overboard and sinks, does the lake level drop, rise, or stay the same?\nRESPONSE Together the boat and rock float, so the buoyant force on them\nequals their total weight. The boat and rock displace a mass of water whose\nweight is equal to the weight of boat plus rock. When the rock is thrown into the\nlake, it displaces only its own volume, which is smaller than the volume of water\nthe rock displaced when in the boat (~3 as much because the rock\'s density is\n~3 times greater than water). So less lake water is displaced and the water level\nof the lake drops when the rock is in the lake.\nMaybe numbers can help. Suppose the boat and the rock each has a mass of\n60 kg. Then the boat carrying the rock displaces 120 kg of water, which is a volume\nof 0.12 m3 (p = 1000 kg/m3 for water, Table 10-1). When the rock is thrown\ninto the lake, the boat alone now displaces 0.06 m3. The rock displaces only its\nown volume of 0.02 m3 (p= m/V ~ 3 so V ~ 0.06 m3/3). Thus a total of 0.08 m3\nof water is displaced. Less water is displaced so the water level of the lake drops.\nEXERCISE E If you throw a flat 60-kg aluminum plate into water, the plate sinks.

Explain.\n10-8 Fluids in Motion; Flow Rate\nand the Equation of Continuity\nWe now turn to the subject of fluids in motion, which is called fluid dynamics, or\n(especially if the fluid is water) hydrodynamics.\nWe can distinguish two main types of fluid flow. If the flow is smooth, such that\nneighboring layers of the fluid slide by each other smoothly, the flow is said to be\nstreamline or laminar flow.+ In streamline flow, each particle of the fluid follows a\nsmooth path, called a streamline, and these paths do not cross one another (Fig. 10-18a).\n*The word laminar means "in layers."\n272 CHAPTER 10 Fluids\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': "FIGURE 10-18 (a) Streamline,\nor laminar, flow; (b) turbulent\nflow.

Turbulent flow is characterized\nby erratic, small, whirlpool-like circles called eddy currents or eddies (Fig. 10-18b).\nEddies absorb a great deal of energy, and although a certain amount of internal\nfriction called viscosity is present even during streamline flow, it is much greater\nwhen the flow is turbulent. A few tiny drops of ink or food coloring dropped into a\nmoving liquid can quickly reveal whether the flow is streamline or turbulent.\nLet us consider the steady laminar flow of a fluid through an enclosed tube\nor pipe as shown in Fig. 10-19. First we determine how the speed of the fluid\nchanges when the diameter of the tube changes. The mass flow rate is defined as the\nmass Am of fluid that passes a given point per unit time At:\nmass flow rate\nAm\nAt\n.\nIn Fig. 10-19, the volume of fluid passing point 1 (through area A1) in a time At\nis A1 421, where 441 is the distance the fluid moves in time At.

Similarly, at point 2 (through\narea A2), the flow rate is P2 A2 02. Since no fluid flows in or out the sides of the\ntube, the flow rates through A1 and A2 must be equal. Thus\nAt\nAm1 Am2,\nAt\nand\nPA1 V1 = P2 A2 U2.\n(10-4a)\nThis is called the equation of continuity.\nIf the fluid is incompressible (p doesn't change with pressure), which is an\nexcellent approximation for liquids under most circumstances (and sometimes\nfor gases as well), then p1 = P2, and the equation of continuity becomes\nA1 V1 = A2 U2.\n[p = constant] (10-4b)\nThe product Av represents the volume rate of flow (volume of fluid passing a given\npoint per second), since AV/At = A Al/At = Av, which in SI units is m3/s.\nEquation 10-4b tells us that where the cross-sectional area is large, the velocity\nis small, and where the area is small, the velocity is large. That this is reasonable\ncan be seen by looking at a river. A river flows slowly through a meadow where it\nis broad, but speeds up to torrential speed when passing through a narrow gorge.\n+If there were no viscosity, the velocity would be the same across a cross section of the tube. Real\nfluids have viscosity, and this internal friction causes different layers of the fluid to flow at different\nspeeds.

These are examples of a principle worked out by Daniel\nBernoulli (1700-1782) concerning fluids in motion. In essence, Bernoulli's principle\nstates that where the velocity of a fluid is high, the pressure is low, and where the\nvelocity is low, the pressure is high. For example, if the pressure in the fluid is\nmeasured at points 1 and 2 of Fig. 10-19, it will be found that the pressure is\nlower at point 2, where the velocity is greater, than it is at point 1, where the\nvelocity is smaller. At first glance, this might seem strange; you might expect that\nthe greater speed at point 2 would imply a higher pressure. But this cannot be the case:\n274 CHAPTER 10 Fluids\n", 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': "if the pressure in the fluid at point 2 were higher than at point 1, this higher\npressure would slow the fluid down, whereas in fact it has sped up in going from\npoint 1 to point 2. Thus the pressure at point 2 must be less than at point 1, to be\nconsistent with the fact that the fluid accelerates.\nTo help clarify any misconceptions, a faster fluid might indeed exert a greater\nforce bouncing off an obstacle placed in its path. But that is not what we mean\nby the pressure in a fluid. We are examining smooth streamline flow, with no\nobstacles that interrupt the flow. The fluid pressure is exerted on the walls of a\ntube or pipe, or on the surface of a material the fluid passes over.\nBernoulli developed an equation that expresses this principle quantitatively.\nTo derive Bernoulli's equation, we assume the flow is steady and laminar, the\nfluid is incompressible, and the viscosity is small enough to be ignored. To be\ngeneral, we assume the fluid is flowing in a tube of nonuniform cross section that\nvaries in height above some reference level, Fig. 10-22. We will consider the\nvolume of fluid shown in color and calculate the work done to move it from the\nposition shown in Fig. 10-22a to that shown in Fig. 10-22b. In this process, fluid\nentering area A1 flows a distance Al1 and forces the fluid at area A2 to move a\ndistance Al2. The fluid to the left of area A1 exerts a pressure PI on our section\nof fluid and does an amount of work\nA\nB\n1\n- Al2-\nV2\n4.\nP2\nA2\nP1\nAl,\ny2\ny\n>\n(a)\nW1 = F144 = P1A146,\n(since P = F/A). At point 2, the work done on our section of fluid is\nW2 = - P2 A2 422.\nThe negative sign is present because the force exerted on the fluid is opposite to\nthe displacement. Work is also done on the fluid by the force of gravity. The net\neffect of the process shown in Fig. 10-22 is to move a mass m of volume A1401\n(= A2 422, since the fluid is incompressible) from point 1 to point 2, so the work\ndone by gravity is\nW3 = - mg(y2 -y1),\nwhere y1 and y2 are heights of the center of the tube above some (arbitrary) refer-\nence level. In the case shown in Fig. 10-22, this term is negative since the motion\nis uphill against the force of gravity. The net work W done on the fluid is thus\nW = W1 + W2 + W3\nW = P1 A1 Al1 - P2 A2 Al2 - mgy2 + mgy1.\nAccording to the work-energy principle (Section 6-3), the net work done on a\nsystem is equal to its change in kinetic energy. Hence\nmo=PAP2 A2 Al2 - mgy2 + mgy.\nThe mass m has volume A1 401 = A2 422 for an incompressible fluid. Thus we can\nsubstitute m = pA1 401 = pA2 422, and then divide through by A1 401 = A2422,\nto obtain\n[ PUz - / pu} = P1 - P2 - pgy2 + pgy1,\nwhich we rearrange to get\nP2 + žpvź + pgy2 = P1 + ¿pv2 + pgy1.\n(10-5)\nThis is Bernoulli's equation. Since points 1 and 2 can be any two points along a\ntube of flow, Bernoulli's equation can be written as\nP + ¿pv2 + pgy = constant\nat every point in the fluid, where y is the height of the center of the tube above a\nfixed reference level. [Note that if there is no flow (v1 = 02 = 0), then Eq. 10-5\nreduces to the hydrostatic equation, Eq. 10-3b or c: P1 - P2 = pg(y2 - y1).]\nAl\n0\n(b)\nFIGURE 10-22 Fluid flow: for\nderivation of Bernoulli's equation.\nBernoulli's equation\nSECTION 10-9 Bernoulli's Equation 275\n", 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Bernoulli's equation is an expression of the law of energy conservation, since\nwe derived it from the work-energy principle.\nEXERCISE F As water in a level pipe passes from a narrow cross section of pipe to a wider\ncross section, how does the pressure against the walls change?\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHot-water heating system\nEXAMPLE 10-14\nFlow and pressure in a hot-water heating system.\nWater circulates throughout a house in a hot-water heating system.

One example is to calculate\nthe velocity, v1, of a liquid flowing out of a spigot at the bottom of a reservoir,\nFig. 10-23. We choose point 2 in Eq. 10-5 to be the top surface of the liquid.\nAssuming the diameter of the reservoir is large compared to that of the spigot,\n02 will be almost zero. Points 1 (the spigot) and 2 (top surface) are open to the\natmosphere, so the pressure at both points is equal to atmospheric pressure:\nP1 = P2. Then Bernoulli's equation becomes\nFIGURE 10-23 Torricelli's theorem:\nV1 = V2g(12 - yı).\nor\nž pvz + pgy1 = pgy2\nV1 = V2g(12 - yı) .\n(10-6)\nThis result is called Torricelli's theorem. Although it is seen to be a special case of\nBernoulli's equation, it was discovered a century earlier by Evangelista Torricelli.\nEquation 10-6 tells us that the liquid leaves the spigot with the same speed that\na freely falling object would attain if falling from the same height. This should\nnot be too surprising since the derivation of Bernoulli's equation relies on the\nconservation of energy.\n276 CHAPTER 10 Fluids\n", 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Another special case of Bernoulli\'s equation arises when a fluid is flowing\nhorizontally with no appreciable change in height; that is, y1 = y2.

It explains many common phenomena, some of which are illustrated\nin Figs. 10-24 to 10-30. The pressure in the air blown at high speed across the\ntop of the vertical tube of a perfume atomizer (Fig. 10-24a) is less than the normal\nair pressure acting on the surface of the liquid in the bowl. Thus atmospheric\npressure in the bowl pushes the perfume up the tube because of the lower pres-\nsure at the top. A Ping-Pong ball can be made to float above a blowing jet of air\n(a hair dryer or a vacuum cleaner that can also blow air), Fig. 10-24b; if the ball\nbegins to leave the jet of air, the higher pressure in the still air outside the jet\npushes the ball back in.\nEXERCISE G Return to Chapter-Opening Question 2, page 260, and answer it again now.\nTry to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.

See Fig. 10-25, where stream-\nlines of air are shown rushing by the wing (we are in the reference frame of the\nwing, as if sitting on the wing). The upward tilt, as well as the rounded upper sur-\nface of the wing, causes the streamlines to be forced upward and to be crowded\ntogether above the wing. The area of air flowing between any two streamlines is\nsmaller as the streamlines get closer together, so from the equation of contin-\nuity (A101 = A202), the air speed increases above the wing where the streamlines\nare squished together. (Recall also how the crowded streamlines in a pipe\nconstriction, Fig. 10-19, indicate the velocity is higher in the constriction.)\nThus the air speed is greater above the wing than below it, so the pressure above\nthe wing is less than the pressure below the wing (Bernoulli\'s principle). Hence\nthere is a net upward force on the wing called dynamic lift. Experiments show\nthat the speed of air above the wing can even be double the speed of the air\nbelow it. (Friction between the air and wing exerts a drag force, toward the rear,\nwhich must be overcome by the plane\'s engines.)\nA flat wing, or one with symmetric cross section, will experience lift as long as\nthe front of the wing is tilted upward (attack angle). The wing shown in Fig. 10-25\ncan experience lift even if the attack angle is zero, because the rounded upper\nsurface deflects air up, squeezing the streamlines together. Airplanes can fly upside\ndown, experiencing lift, if the attack angle is sufficient to deflect streamlines up\nand closer together.\nOur picture considers streamlines; but if the attack angle is larger than about\n15°, turbulence sets in (Fig. 10-18b) leading to greater drag and less lift, causing\nthe plane to "stall" and then to drop.\nFrom another point of view, the upward tilt of a wing means the air moving\nhorizontally in front of the wing is deflected downward; the change in momentum\nof the rebounding air molecules results in an upward force on the wing (Newton\'s\nthird law).\nFIGURE 10-25 Lift on an airplane\nwing.

The air traveling rapidly over\nthe bulging front surface of the mainsail exerts a smaller pressure than the relatively\nstill air behind the sail. The result is a net force on the sail, Fwind, as shown in\nFig. 10-26b. This force would tend to make the boat move sideways if it weren\'t\nfor the keel that extends vertically downward beneath the water: the water exerts\na force (Fwater) on the keel nearly perpendicular to the keel.

It is simplest if we put ourselves in the reference\nframe of the ball, with the air rushing by, just as we did for the airplane wing.\nSuppose the ball is rotating counterclockwise as seen from above, Fig. 10-27.\nA thin layer of air ("boundary layer") is being dragged around by the ball. We are\nlooking down on the ball, and at point A in Fig. 10-27, this boundary layer tends\nto slow down the oncoming air. At point B, the air rotating with the ball adds\nits speed to that of the oncoming air, so the air speed is higher at B than at A.\nThe higher speed at B means the pressure is lower at B than at A, resulting in a\nnet force toward B. The ball\'s path curves toward the left (as seen by the pitcher).\nLack of Blood to the Brain-TIA\nIn medicine, one of many applications of Bernoulli\'s principle is to explain a TIA,\na transient ischemic attack (meaning a temporary lack of blood supply to the brain).\nA person suffering a TIA may experience symptoms such as dizziness, double\nvision, headache, and weakness of the limbs. A TIA can occur as follows. Blood\nnormally flows up to the brain at the back of the head via the two vertebral\narteries-one going up each side of the neck-which meet to form the basilar\nartery just below the brain, as shown in Fig. 10-28. Each vertebral artery connects\nto the subclavian artery, as shown, before the blood passes to the arms. When\nan arm is exercised vigorously, blood flow increases to meet the needs of the\narm\'s muscles. If the subclavian artery on one side of the body is partially blocked,\nhowever, as in arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), the blood velocity\nwill have to be higher on that side to supply the needed blood. (Recall the equa-\ntion of continuity: smaller area means larger velocity for the same flow rate,\nEqs. 10-4.) The increased blood velocity past the opening to the vertebral artery\nresults in lower pressure (Bernoulli\'s principle). Thus, blood rising in the verte-\nbral artery on the "good" side at normal pressure can be diverted down into the\nother vertebral artery because of the low pressure on that side, instead of passing\nupward to the brain. Hence the blood supply to the brain is reduced.\nOther Applications\nA venturi tube is essentially a pipe with a narrow constriction (the throat). The\nflowing fluid speeds up as it passes through this constriction, so the pressure is\nlower in the throat. A venturi meter, Fig. 10-29, is used to measure the flow speed\nof gases and liquids, including blood velocity in arteries. The velocity v1 can be\ndetermined by measuring the pressure P 1 and P2 , the areas A 1 and A2 , as well as\nthe density of the fluid. (The formula is given in Problem 50.)\nP1\nP2\nFIGURE 10-29 Venturi meter.\nB\nv\nB\nv\n1\n2\nA2\nWhy does smoke go up a chimney? It\'s partly because hot air rises (it\'s less\ndense and therefore buoyant). But Bernoulli\'s principle also plays a role. When wind\nblows across the top of a chimney, the pressure is less there than inside the house.\nHence, air and smoke are pushed up the chimney by the higher indoor pressure.\nEven on an apparently still night there is usually enough ambient air flow at the\ntop of a chimney to assist upward flow of smoke.\nIf gophers, prairie dogs, rabbits, and other animals that live underground are\nto avoid suffocation, the air must circulate in their burrows. The burrows always\nhave at least two entrances (Fig. 10-30). The speed of air flow across different\nholes will usually be slightly different. This results in a slight pressure difference,\nwhich forces a flow of air through the burrow via Bernoulli\'s principle. The flow\nof air is enhanced if one hole is higher than the other (animals often build mounds)\nsince wind speed tends to increase with height.\n278 CHAPTER 10 Fluids\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Bernoulli's equation ignores the effects of friction (viscosity) and the com-\npressibility of the fluid. The energy that is transformed to internal (or potential)\nenergy due to compression and to thermal energy by friction can be taken into\naccount by adding terms to Eq. 10-5. These terms are difficult to calculate\ntheoretically and are normally determined empirically for given situations. They\ndo not significantly alter the explanations for the phenomena described above.\n*\n10-11 Viscosity\nReal fluids have a certain amount of internal friction called viscosity, as men-\ntioned in Section 10-8. Viscosity exists in both liquids and gases, and is essentially\na frictional force between adjacent layers of fluid as the layers move past one\nanother. In liquids, viscosity is due to the electrical cohesive forces between the\nmolecules. In gases, it arises from collisions between the molecules.\nThe viscosity of different fluids can be expressed quantitatively by a coeffi-\ncient of viscosity, y (the Greek lowercase letter eta), which is defined in the fol-\nlowing way. A thin layer of fluid is placed between two flat plates. One plate\nis stationary and the other is made to move, Fig. 10-31. The fluid directly in\ncontact with each plate is held to the surface by the adhesive force between the\nmolecules of the liquid and those of the plate. Thus the upper surface of the\nfluid moves with the same speed v as the upper plate, whereas the fluid in contact\nwith the stationary plate remains stationary. The stationary layer of fluid retards\nthe flow of the layer just above it, which in turn retards the flow of the next layer,\nand so on. Thus the velocity varies continuously from 0 to v, as shown. The\nincrease in velocity divided by the distance over which this change is made-equal\nto v/l-is called the velocity gradient. To move the upper plate requires a force,\nwhich you can verify by moving a flat plate across a puddle of syrup on a table.\nFor a given fluid, it is found that the force required, F, is proportional to the\narea of fluid in contact with each plate, A, and to the speed, v, and is inversely\nproportional to the separation, l, of the plates: F & vA/l. For different fluids,\nthe more viscous the fluid, the greater is the required force. The proportionality\nconstant for this equation is defined as the coefficient of viscosity, n:\nF = MA 2.\n(10-8)\nSolving for , we find n = Fl/vA. The SI unit for n is N .s/m2 = Pa .s\n(pascal · second). In the cgs system, the unit is dyne · s/cm2, which is called a\npoise (P). Viscosities are often given in centipoise (1 cP = 10-2 P = 10-3 Pa · s).\nTable 10-3 lists the coefficient of viscosity for various fluids. The temperature\nis also specified, since it has a strong effect; the viscosity of liquids such as motor\noil, for example, decreases rapidly as temperature increases.\n*\n10-12 Flow in Tubes: Poiseuille's\nEquation, Blood Flow\nIf a fluid had no viscosity, it could flow through a level tube or pipe without a\nforce being applied. Viscosity acts like a sort of friction (between fluid layers\nmoving at slightly different speeds), so a pressure difference between the ends of\na level tube is necessary for the steady flow of any real fluid, be it water or oil in a\npipe, or blood in the circulatory system of a human.\n*The Society of Automotive Engineers assigns numbers to represent the viscosity of oils: 30-weight\n(SAE 30) is more viscous than 10-weight. Multigrade oils, such as 20-50, are designed to maintain\nviscosity as temperature increases; 20-50 means the oil acts like 20-weight when cool and is like\n50-weight when it is hot (engine running temperature). In other words, the viscosity does not\ndrop precipitously as the oil warms up, as a simple 20-weight oil would.\nMoving plate\nB\nF\nFluid\nVelocity\ngradient\n1\nl\nStationary plate\nFIGURE 10-31 Determination of\nviscosity.\nTABLE 10-3\nCoefficients of Viscosity\nFluid\n(temperature\nin °℃)\nCoefficient\nof Viscosity,\n(Pa . s)*\nWater (0°)\n1.8×10-3\n(20°)\n1.0× 10-3\n(100°)\n0.3× 10-3\nWhole blood (37°)\n~4×10-3\nBlood plasma (37°) ~1.5 × 10-3\nEthyl alcohol (20°)\n1.2 × 10-3\nEngine oil (30°)\n(SAE 10)\n200 × 10-3\nGlycerine (20°)\n1500 × 10-3\nAir (20°)\n0.018 × 10-3\nHydrogen (0°)\n0.009 × 10-3\nWater vapor (100°) 0.013 × 10-3\n+1 Pa ·s = 10 poise (P) = 1000 cP.\n*SECTION 10-12 Flow in Tubes: Poiseuille's Equation, Blood Flow 279\n", 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Wall of\nartery\n(a)\nArtery wall\nthickening\nBlockage\n(b)\nFIGURE 10-32 A cross section of a\nhuman artery that (a) is healthy,\n(b) is partly blocked as a result of\narteriosclerosis.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nMedicine-\nblood flow and\nheart disease\nFIGURE 10-33 Spherical water\ndroplets, dew on a blade of grass.\nThe French scientist J. L. Poiseuille (1799-1869), who was interested in the\nphysics of blood circulation (and after whom the "poise" is named), determined how\nthe variables affect the flow rate of an incompressible fluid undergoing laminar\nflow in a cylindrical tube. His result, known as Poiseuille\'s equation, is:\n8ml\nTT R4(P1 - P2)\n,\n(10-9)\nwhere R is the inside radius of the tube, { is the tube length, P1 - P2 is the pressure\ndifference between the ends, n is the coefficient of viscosity, and Q is the volume\nrate of flow (volume of fluid flowing past a given point per unit time which in SI\nhas units of m3/s). Equation 10-9 applies only to laminar (streamline) flow.\nPoiseuille\'s equation tells us that the flow rate Q is directly proportional to\nthe "pressure gradient," (P1 - P2)/2, and it is inversely proportional to the viscos-\nity of the fluid. This is just what we might expect. It may be surprising, however,\nthat Q also depends on the fourth power of the tube\'s radius. This means that for\nthe same pressure gradient, if the tube radius is halved, the flow rate is decreased\nby a factor of 16! Thus the rate of flow, or alternately the pressure required to\nmaintain a given flow rate, is greatly affected by only a small change in tube radius.\nAn interesting example of this R4 dependence is blood flow in the human\nbody. Poiseuille\'s equation is valid only for the streamline flow of an incompres-\nsible fluid. So it cannot be precisely accurate for blood whose flow is not without\nturbulence and that contains blood cells (whose diameter is almost equal to that\nof a capillary). Nonetheless, Poiseuille\'s equation does give a reasonable first\napproximation. Because the radius of arteries is reduced as a result of arterioscle-\nrosis (thickening and hardening of artery walls, Fig. 10-32) and by cholesterol\nbuildup, the pressure gradient must be increased to maintain the same flow rate.\nIf the radius is reduced by half, the heart would have to increase the pressure\nby a factor of about 24 = 16 in order to maintain the same blood-flow rate.\nThe heart must work much harder under these conditions, but usually cannot\nmaintain the original flow rate. Thus, high blood pressure is an indication both\nthat the heart is working harder and that the blood-flow rate is reduced.\n*\n10-13 Surface Tension and Capillarity\nFIGURE 10-34 U-shaped wire\napparatus holding a film of liquid to\nmeasure surface tension (Y = F/2º).\nγ\nl\nF\nγ\n*\n(a) Top view\nγ\nF\nLiquid\nγ\nWire\n(b) Edge view (magnified)\nThe surface of a liquid at rest behaves in an interesting way, almost as if it were\na stretched membrane under tension. For example, a drop of water on the end\nof a dripping faucet, or hanging from a thin branch in the early morning dew\n(Fig. 10-33), forms into a nearly spherical shape as if it were a tiny balloon filled\nwith water. A steel needle can be made to float on the surface of water even though\nit is denser than the water. The surface of a liquid acts like it is under tension,\nand this tension, acting along the surface, arises from the attractive forces between\nthe molecules. This effect is called surface tension. More specifically, a quantity\ncalled the surface tension, Y (the Greek letter gamma), is defined as the force F\nper unit length & that acts perpendicular to any line or cut in a liquid surface,\ntending to pull the surface closed:\nY = F.\nF\n(10-10)\nTo understand this, consider the U-shaped apparatus shown in Fig. 10-34 which\nencloses a thin film of liquid (such as a liquid soap film). Because of surface tension,\na force F is required to pull the movable wire and thus increase the surface area of\nthe liquid. The liquid contained by the wire apparatus is a thin film having both a\ntop and a bottom surface. Hence the total length of the surface being increased is 20,\nand the surface tension is Y = F/20. A delicate apparatus of this type can be used\nto measure the surface tension of various liquids. The surface tension of water is\n0.072 N/m at 20℃. Table 10-4 (next page) gives the values for several substances.\nNote that temperature has a considerable effect on the surface tension.\n280 CHAPTER 10 Fluids\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 22, 'type': 'text', 'content': '(a)\nFIGURE 10-35 (a) Water strider. (b) Paper clip (light coming through window blinds).\n(b)\nBecause of surface tension, some insects (Fig. 10-35a) can walk on water, and\nobjects more dense than water, such as a paper clip (Fig. 10-35b), can float on the\nsurface. Figure 10-36a shows how the surface tension can support the weight w of an\nobject. Actually, the object sinks slightly into the fluid, so w is the "effective weight"\nof that object-its true weight less the buoyant force.\nEXAMPLE 10-15 |ESTIMATE\nInsect walks on water. The base of an insect\'s\nleg is approximately spherical in shape, with a radius of about 2.0 × 10-5 m.\nThe 0.0030-g mass of the insect is supported equally by its six legs. Estimate the\nangle 0 at which the surface tension force acts (see Fig. 10-36) for an insect on\nthe surface of water. Assume the water temperature is 20℃.\nAPPROACH Since the insect is in equilibrium, the upward surface tension force\nis equal to the pull of gravity downward on each leg. We ignore buoyant forces\nfor this estimate.\nSOLUTION For each leg, we assume the surface tension force acts all around a\ncircle of radius r, at an angle 0, as shown in Fig. 10-36a. Only the vertical compo-\nnent, Y cos 0, acts to balance the weight mg. We set the length ( in Eq. 10-10\nequal to the circumference of the circle, ( ~ 2mr. Then the net upward force\ndue to surface tension is Fy ~ (Y cos 0) { ~2mTY cos 0. We set this surface tension\nforce equal to one-sixth the weight of the insect since it has six legs:\n2Try cose ~ 5mg\n(6.28)(2.0×10-5m)(0.072N/m) cos0 ~ }(3.0× 10-6kg)(9.8m/s2)\ncos 0 ~ 0.54.\nSo 0 ~ 57°.\nNOTE If cos 0 had come out greater than 1, the surface tension would not have\nbeen great enough to support the insect\'s weight. If the insect is very light, it will\nsink less into the water and 0 (Fig. 10-36a) will be larger than calculated above.\nNOTE Our estimate ignored the buoyant force and ignored any difference\nbetween the radius of the insect\'s "foot" and the radius of the surface depression.\nSoaps and detergents lower the surface tension of water. This is desirable for\nwashing and cleaning since the high surface tension of pure water prevents it\nfrom penetrating easily between the fibers of material and into tiny crevices.\nSubstances that reduce the surface tension of a liquid are called surfactants.\n*\nCapillarity\nSurface tension plays a role in another interesting phenomenon, capillarity. It is a\ncommon observation that water in a glass container rises up slightly where it\ntouches the glass, Fig. 10-37a. The water is said to "wet" the glass. Mercury, on\nthe other hand, is depressed when it touches the glass, Fig. 10-37b; the mercury\ndoes not wet the glass. Whether a liquid wets a solid surface is determined by the\nrelative strength of the cohesive forces between the molecules of the liquid\ncompared to the adhesive forces between the molecules of the liquid and those\nof the container. Cohesion refers to the force between molecules of the same type,\nwhereas adhesion refers to the force between molecules of different types. Water\nwets glass because the water molecules are more strongly attracted to the glass\nmolecules than they are to other water molecules. The opposite is true for mer-\ncury: the cohesive forces are stronger than the adhesive forces.\nTABLE 10-4 Surface Tension\nof Some Substances\nSubstance\nSurface\nTension\n(N/m)\nMercury (20°℃)\n0.44\nBlood, whole (37°℃)\n0.058\nBlood, plasma (37°℃)\n0.073\nAlcohol, ethyl (20°℃)\n0.023\nWater (0℃)\n0.076\n(20℃)\n0.072\n(100°℃)\n0.059\nBenzene (20°℃)\n0.029\nSoap solution (20℃)\n≥0.025\nOxygen (-193°℃)\n0.016\nF =Yl\n1\nF = Yl\n1\nro\n/\nľ\n(a)\nw\nF\nF\n11111\n(b)\nFIGURE 10-36 Surface tension\nacting on (a) a sphere, and (b) an\ninsect leg.

A vacuum pump\nis designed to reduce the pressure (usually of air) in a given vessel. A force pump,\non the other hand, is a pump that is intended to increase the pressure-for exam-\nple, to lift a liquid (such as water from a well) or to push a fluid through a pipe.\nFigure 10-39 illustrates the principle behind a simple reciprocating pump. It\ncould be a vacuum pump, in which case the intake is connected to the vessel\nto be evacuated. A similar mechanism is used in some force pumps, and in this\ncase the fluid is forced under increased pressure through the outlet.\nAnother type of pump is the centrifugal pump, shown in Fig. 10-40. It, or any\nforce pump, can be used as a circulating pump-that is, to circulate a fluid around a\nclosed path, such as the cooling water or lubricating oil in an automobile.\nPiston\nIntake\nFIGURE 10-40 Centrifugal pump:\nIntake\nOutlet\nthe rotating blades force fluid\nthrough the outlet pipe; this kind of\npump is used in vacuum cleaners\nand as a water pump in automobiles.\nRotor\n*\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHeart as a pump\nThe heart of a human (and of other animals as well) is essentially a circulating\npump. The action of a human heart is shown in Fig. 10-41. There are actually\ntwo separate paths for blood flow. The longer path takes blood to the parts of\nthe body, via the arteries, bringing oxygen to body tissues and picking up carbon\ndioxide, which it carries back to the heart via veins. This blood is then pumped\nto the lungs (the second path), where the carbon dioxide is released and oxygen\nis taken up. The oxygen-laden blood is returned to the heart, where it is again\npumped to the tissues of the body.\nRight atrium\n(from the body)\nLeft atrium\n(from the lungs)\nFIGURE 10-41 Pumping human heart. (a) In\nthe diastole phase, the heart relaxes between\nbeats. Blood moves into the heart; both atria\nfill rapidly. (b) When the atria contract, the\nsystole or pumping phase begins. The\ncontraction pushes the blood through the\nmitral and tricuspid valves into the ventricles.\n(c) The contraction of the ventricles forces\nthe blood through the semilunar valves into\nthe pulmonary artery, which leads to the\nlungs, and to the aorta (the body's largest\nartery), which leads to the arteries serving all\nthe body. (d) When the heart relaxes, the\nsemilunar valves close; blood fills the atria,\nbeginning the cycle again.\nTricuspid\nvalve\nPulmonary\nartery\n(to lungs)\nSemilunar\nvalve\nMitral\nvalve\nRight\nventricle\n(a)\nAorta\n(to the\nbody)\nRight\natrium\nSemilunar\nvalve\nTricuspid\nvalve\n(c)\nLeft\n(b)\nventricle\nLeft\natrium\nMitral\nvalve\n(d)\n282 CHAPTER 10 Fluids\n", 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 24, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Blood pressure is measured using one of the types of gauge mentioned earlier\n(Section 10-6), and it is usually calibrated in mm-Hg. The gauge is attached to\na closed, air-filled cuff that is wrapped around the upper arm at the level of the\nheart, Fig. 10-42. Two values of blood pressure are measured: the maximum pres-\nsure when the heart is pumping, called systolic pressure; and the pressure when the\nheart is in the resting part of the cycle, called diastolic pressure. Initially, the air\npressure in the cuff is increased high above the systolic pressure by a pump,\ncompressing the main (brachial) artery in the arm and briefly cutting off the flow\nof blood. The air pressure is then reduced slowly until blood again begins to flow\ninto the arm; it can be detected by listening with a stethoscope to the characteristic\ntapping sound of the blood returning to the forearm. At this point, systolic pressure\nis just equal to the air pressure in the arm cuff which can be read off the gauge.\nThe air pressure is subsequently reduced further, and the tapping sound disappears\nwhen blood at low pressure can enter the artery. At this point, the gauge indicates\nthe diastolic pressure. Normal systolic pressure is around 120 mm-Hg, whereas\nnormal diastolic pressure is around 70 or 80 mm-Hg. Blood pressure is reported\nin the form 120/70.\n+When the blood starts flowing through the constriction caused by the tight cuff, its velocity is high\nand the flow is turbulent. It is the turbulence that causes the tapping sound.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nBlood pressure\nFIGURE 10-42 Device for\nmeasuring blood pressure.\nHand\npump\nCuff\nGauge\nSummary\nThe three common phases of matter are solid, liquid, and gas.\nLiquids and gases are collectively called fluids, meaning they\nhave the ability to flow. The density of a material is defined as\nits mass per unit volume:\np = m .\n(10-1)\nSpecific gravity (SG) is the ratio of the density of the material to\nthe density of water (at 4℃).\nPressure is defined as force per unit area:\nP = F.\n(10-2)\nThe pressure P at a depth h in a liquid of constant density p, due\nto the weight of the liquid, is given by\nP = pgh,\n(10-3a)\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity.\nPascal's principle says that an external pressure applied to\na confined fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid.\nPressure is measured using a manometer or other type of\ngauge. A barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure.\nStandard atmospheric pressure (average at sea level) is\n1.013 × 105 N/m2. Gauge pressure is the total (absolute) pres-\nsure minus atmospheric pressure.\nArchimedes' principle states that an object submerged\nwholly or partially in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to\nthe weight of fluid it displaces (FB = MFg = PF Vdispl g).\nFluid flow can be characterized either as streamline\n(also called laminar), in which the layers of fluid move\nsmoothly and regularly along paths called streamlines, or as\nturbulent, in which case the flow is not smooth and regular but\nis characterized by irregularly shaped whirlpools.\nFluid flow rate is the mass or volume of fluid that passes a\ngiven point per unit time. The equation of continuity states\nthat for an incompressible fluid flowing in an enclosed tube,\nthe product of the velocity of flow and the cross-sectional area\nof the tube remains constant:\nAv = constant.\n(10-4)\nBernoulli's principle tells us that where the velocity of a\nfluid is high, the pressure in it is low, and where the velocity is\nlow, the pressure is high. For steady laminar flow of an incom-\npressible and nonviscous fluid, Bernoulli's equation, which is\nbased on the law of conservation of energy, is\nP2 + poz+ pgy2 = P1 + {0} + pgy,\n(10-5)\nfor two points along the flow.\n[*Viscosity refers to friction within a fluid and is essentially\na frictional force between adjacent layers of fluid as they move\npast one another.]\n[*Liquid surfaces hold together as if under tension\n(surface tension), allowing drops to form and objects like needles\nand insects to stay on the surface.]\nQuestions\n1. If one material has a higher density than another, must the\nmolecules of the first be heavier than those of the second?\nExplain.\n2.

Spiders detect prey by the vibrations of their webs; cars oscillate\nup and down when they hit a bump; buildings and bridges vibrate when heavy\ntrucks pass or the wind is fierce. Indeed, because most solids are elastic (see\nSection 9-5), they vibrate (at least briefly) when given an impulse. Electrical oscilla-\ntions occur in radio and television sets. At the atomic level, atoms oscillate within a\nmolecule, and the atoms of a solid oscillate about their relatively fixed positions.\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 34, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Because it is so common in everyday life and occurs in so many areas of physics,\noscillatory (or vibrational) motion is of great importance. Mechanical oscillations\nor vibrations are fully described on the basis of Newtonian mechanics.\nVibrations and wave motion are intimately related. Waves-whether ocean\nwaves, waves on a string, earthquake waves, or sound waves in air-have as their\nsource a vibration. In the case of sound, not only is the source a vibrating object,\nbut so is the detector-the eardrum or the membrane of a microphone. Indeed,\nwhen a wave travels through a medium, the medium oscillates (such as air for\nsound waves). In the second half of this Chapter, after we discuss oscillations, we\nwill discuss simple waves such as those on water or on a string. In Chapter 12\nwe will study sound waves, and in later Chapters we will encounter other forms\nof wave motion, including electromagnetic waves and light.\n11-1 Simple Harmonic Motion-\nSpring Oscillations\nWhen an object vibrates or oscillates back and forth, over the same path, each\noscillation taking the same amount of time, the motion is periodic. The simplest\nform of periodic motion is represented by an object oscillating on the end of a\nuniform coil spring. Because many other types of oscillatory motion closely\nresemble this system, we will look at it in detail. We assume that the mass of the\nspring can be ignored, and that the spring is mounted horizontally, as shown in\nFig. 11-1a, so that the object of mass m slides without friction on the horizontal\nsurface. Any spring has a natural length at which it exerts no force on the mass m.\nThe position of the mass at this point is called the equilibrium position. If the mass\nis moved either to the left, which compresses the spring, or to the right, which\nstretches it, the spring exerts a force on the mass that acts in the direction of\nreturning the mass to the equilibrium position; hence it is called a restoring force.\nWe consider the common situation where we can assume the restoring force F\nis directly proportional to the displacement x the spring has been stretched\n(Fig. 11-1b) or compressed (Fig. 11-1c) from the equilibrium position:\nF = - kx.\n[force exerted by spring] (11-1)\nNote that the equilibrium position has been chosen at x = 0 and the minus sign\nin Eq. 11-1 indicates that the restoring force is always in the direction opposite\nto the displacement x. For example, if we choose the positive direction to the\nright in Fig. 11-1, x is positive when the spring is stretched (Fig. 11-1b), but the\ndirection of the restoring force is to the left (negative direction). If the spring\nis compressed, x is negative (to the left) but the force F acts toward the right\n(Fig. 11-1c).\nEquation 11-1 is often referred to as Hooke's law (Sections 6-4 and 9-5), and\nis accurate only if the spring is not compressed to where the coils are close to\ntouching, or stretched beyond the elastic region (see Fig. 9-19). Hooke's law\nworks not only for springs but for other oscillating solids as well; it thus has wide\napplicability, even though it is valid only over a certain range of F and x values.\nThe proportionality constant k in Eq. 11-1 is called the spring constant for\nthat particular spring, or its spring stiffness constant (units = N/m). To stretch\nthe spring a distance x, an (external) force must be exerted on the free end of the\nspring with a magnitude at least equal to\nFext = +kx.\n[external force on spring]\nThe greater the value of k, the greater the force needed to stretch a spring a given\ndistance. That is, the stiffer the spring, the greater the spring constant k.\nNote that the force Fin Eq. 11-1 is not a constant, but varies with position.\nTherefore the acceleration of the mass m is not constant, so we cannot use the\nequations for constant acceleration developed in Chapter 2.\nm\n(a)\n(b)\nB\nx=0\nB\nm\n-x ->\n(> 0)\nm\n(c)\n-x\n(< 0)\nFIGURE 11-1 An object of mass m\noscillating at the end of a uniform\nspring.

The spring exerts a force on the mass that accel-\nerates it toward the equilibrium position. Because the mass has inertia, it passes\nthe equilibrium position with considerable speed. Indeed, as the mass reaches the\nequilibrium position, the force on it decreases to zero, but its speed at this point is\na maximum, Umax (Fig. 11-2b). As the mass moves farther to the right, the force\non it acts to slow it down, and it stops for an instant at x = A (Fig. 11-2c). It\nthen begins moving back in the opposite direction, accelerating until it passes the\nequilibrium point (Fig. 11-2d), and then slows down until it reaches zero speed\nat the original starting point, x = - A (Fig. 11-2e). It then repeats the motion,\nmoving back and forth symmetrically between x = A and x = - A.\nEXERCISE A A mass is oscillating on a frictionless surface at the end of a horizontal\nspring. Where, if anywhere, is the acceleration of the mass zero (see Fig. 11-2)?\n(a) At x = - A; (b) at x = 0; (c) at x = +A; (d) at both x = - A and x = +A;\n(e) nowhere.\nTo discuss oscillatory motion, we need to define a few terms. The distance x\nof the mass from the equilibrium point at any moment is the displacement\n(with a + or - sign). The maximum displacement-the greatest distance from\nthe equilibrium point-is called the amplitude, A. One cycle refers to the com-\nplete to-and-fro motion from some initial point back to that same point-say,\nfrom x = - A to x = +A and back to x = - A. The period, T, is defined as\nthe time required to complete one cycle. Finally, the frequency, f, is the number\nof complete cycles per second. Frequency is generally specified in hertz (Hz),\nwhere 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second (s-1). Given their definitions, frequency and\nperiod are inversely related, as we saw earlier (Eqs. 5-2 and 8-8):\nf = 1\nT\nand\nT=1\n(11-2)\nFor example, if the frequency is 2 cycles per second, then each cycle takes 2 s.\nEXERCISE B If an oscillating mass has a frequency of 1.25 Hz, it makes 100 oscillations\nin (a) 12.5 s, (b) 125 s, (c) 80 s, (d) 8.0 s.\nThe oscillation of a spring hung vertically is similar to that of a horizontal spring;\nbut because of gravity, the length of a vertical spring with a mass m on the end will\nbe longer at equilibrium than when that same spring is horizontal.

We saw in Section 9-5 that most solid materials\nstretch or compress according to Eq. 11-1 as long as the displacement is not too\ngreat. Because of this, many natural oscillations are simple harmonic, or suffi-\nciently close to it that they can be treated using this SHM model.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 11-2\nIs the motion simple harmonic? Which\nof the following forces would cause an object to move in simple harmonic motion?\n(a) F = - 0.5x2, (b) F =- 2.3y,(c)F=8.6x, (d) F = - 40?\nRESPONSE Both (b) and (d) will give simple harmonic motion because they\ngive the force as minus a constant times a displacement. The displacement need\nnot be x, but the minus sign is required to restore the system to equilibrium,\nwhich is why (c) does not produce SHM.\n11-2 Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion\nWith forces that are not constant, such as here with simple harmonic motion, it is\noften convenient and useful to use the energy approach, as we saw in Chapter 6.\nTo stretch or compress a spring, work has to be done. Hence potential\nenergy is stored in a stretched or compressed spring. We have already seen in\nSection 6-4 that elastic potential energy is given by\nPE = {kx2.\nThe total mechanical energy E is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies,\nE = 2m2 + 2x2,\n(11-3)\nwhere v is the speed of the mass m at a distance x from the equilibrium position.\n*The word "harmonic" refers to the motion being sinusoidal, which we discuss in Section 11-3. It is\n"simple" when the motion is sinusoidal of a single frequency. This can happen only if friction or other\nforces are not acting.\nSECTION 11-2 Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion 295\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 37, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'E=2KA2\nm\n(a)\nx =- A x=0 x=A\n(v= 0)\nE = - mvmax\nm\n(b)\nx =- A x=0 x= A\nE= >kA2\nm\n(c)\nx =- A x= 0 x=A\n(v=0)\nPE KE\nSHM can occur only if friction is negligible so that the total mechanical energy E\nremains constant.

No. The force you exert\nis proportional to the displacement x, so for the second displacement, from\nx = A to 2A, you do more work than for the first displacement (x = 0 to A).\n(b) From Eq. 11-5a, we can see that when the amplitude is doubled, the maxi-\nmum velocity must be doubled.\n(c) Since the force is twice as great when we stretch the spring twice as far (F = kx),\nthe acceleration is also twice as great: a « F x x.\nEXERCISE C Suppose the spring in Fig. 11-5 is compressed to x = - A, but is given\na push to the right so that the initial speed of the mass m is v0 .

From this same\n"reference circle" we can obtain a second useful result-a formula for the posi-\ntion of an oscillating mass as a function of time. There is nothing actually rotating\nin a circle when a spring oscillates linearly, but it is the mathematical similarity\nthat we find useful.\nConsider a small object of mass m revolving counterclockwise in a circle of\nradius A, with constant speed Umax, on top of a table as shown in Fig. 11-7. As\nviewed from above, the motion is a circle in the xy plane. But a person who looks\nat the motion from the edge of the table sees an oscillatory motion back and\nforth, and this one-dimensional motion corresponds precisely to simple harmonic\nmotion, as we shall now see.\nWhat the person sees, and what we are interested in, is the projection of the cir-\ncular motion onto the x axis (Fig. 11-7b). To see that this x motion is analogous to\nSHM, let us calculate the magnitude of the x component of the velocity Umax , which\nis labeled v in Fig. 11-7.

If the restoring force is proportional to s or to 0, the\nmotion will be simple harmonic. The restoring force is the net force on the bob,\nwhich equals the component of the weight (mg) tangent to the arc:\nF = - mg sin 0,\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity. The minus sign here, as in Eq. 11-1,\nmeans the force is in the direction opposite to the angular displacement 0. Since\nF is proportional to the sine of 0 and not to 0 itself, the motion is not SHM.\nHowever, if 0 is small, then sin 0 is very nearly equal to 0 when the angle is speci-\nfied in radians. This can be seen by noting in Fig. 11-12 that the arc length s (= 20)\nis nearly the same length as the chord (= { sin 0) indicated by the horizontal\nstraight dashed line, if 0 is small. For angles less than 15°, the difference between\n0 (in radians) and sin 0 is less than 1%-see Table 11-1. Thus, to a very good\napproximation for small angles,\nF = - mg sin 0 ~ - mg0.\nSubstituting s = 0, or 0 = s/l, we have\nF & --\nmg\nes .\nThus, for small displacements, the motion can be modeled as being approximately\nsimple harmonic, because this approximate equation fits Hooke's law, F = - kx, where\nin place of x we have arc length s. The effective force constant is k = mg/l. If we\nsubstitute k = mg/l into Eq. 11-6a, we obtain the period of a simple pendulum:\nm\nT = 211\nV\nk\n= 2₸\nV mg/l\nm\nor\nl\nT = 2₸\nV\ng\n.\n[0 small] (11-11a)\nThe frequency is f = 1/T, so\nf = 1 8\n2TT Ve\n[0 small] (11-11b)\nThe mass m of the pendulum bob does not appear in these formulas for T and f.\nThus we have the surprising result that the period and frequency of a simple pen-\ndulum do not depend on the mass of the pendulum bob. You may have noticed\nthis if you pushed a small child and then a large one on the same swing.\nWe also see from Eq. 11-11a that the period of a pendulum does not depend\non the amplitude (like any SHM, Section 11-3), as long as the amplitude 0 is small.\nGalileo is said to have first noted this fact while watching a swinging lamp in the\ncathedral at Pisa (Fig. 11-13). This discovery led to the invention of the pendulum\nclock, the first really precise timepiece, which became the standard for centuries.\nEXERCISE E Return to Chapter-Opening Question 1, page 292, and answer it again\nnow.

The accuracy of a\npendulum clock would be affected, after many swings, by the decrease in amplitude\ndue to friction. But the mainspring in a pendulum clock (or the falling weight in a\ngrandfather clock) supplies energy to compensate for the friction and to maintain\nthe amplitude constant, so that the timing remains precise.\n302 CHAPTER 11 Oscillations and Waves\n", 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 44, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 11-9\nMeasuring g.

Figure 11-14 shows a typical graph of\nthe displacement as a function of time. This is called damped harmonic motion. The\ndamping* is generally due to the resistance of air and to internal friction within the\noscillating system. The energy that is dissipated to thermal energy results in a\ndecreased amplitude of oscillation.\nSince natural oscillating systems are damped in general, why do we even talk\nabout (undamped) simple harmonic motion? The answer is that SHM is much\neasier to deal with mathematically. And if the damping is not large, the oscillations\ncan be thought of as simple harmonic motion on which the damping is super-\nposed, as represented by the dashed curves in Fig. 11-14. Although damping\ndoes alter the frequency of vibration, the effect can be small if the damping is\nsmall; then Eqs. 11-6 can still be useful approximations.\nSometimes the damping is so large, however, that the motion no longer resem-\nbles simple harmonic motion. Three common cases of heavily damped systems are\nshown in Fig. 11-15. Curve A represents an underdamped situation, in which the\nsystem makes several oscillations before coming to rest; it corresponds to a more\nheavily damped version of Fig. 11-14. Curve C represents the overdamped situation,\nwhen the damping is so large that there is no oscillation and the system takes a\nlong time to come to rest (equilibrium). Curve B represents critical damping: in\nthis case the displacement reaches zero in the shortest time. These terms all\nderive from the use of practical damped systems such as door-closing mechanisms\nand shock absorbers in a car (Fig. 11-16), which are usually designed to give critical\ndamping. But as they wear out, underdamping occurs: the door of a room slams\nand a car bounces up and down several times when it hits a bump.\nIn many systems, the oscillatory motion is what counts, as in clocks and\nmusical instruments, and damping may need to be minimized. In other systems,\noscillations are the problem, such as a car\'s springs, so a proper amount of damping\n(i.e., critical) is desired. Well-designed damping is needed for all kinds of applica-\ntions. Large buildings, especially in California, are now built (or retrofitted) with\nhuge dampers to reduce possible earthquake damage (Fig. 11-17).\n*To "damp" means to diminish, restrain, or extinguish, as to "dampen one\'s spirits."\nx\n0\n= t\nFIGURE 11-14 Damped harmonic\nmotion.\nFIGURE 11-15 Graphs that represent\n(A) underdamped, (B) critically damped,\nand (C) overdamped oscillatory motion.\nx\nB\nA\nC\nt\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nShock absorbers and\nbuilding dampers\nAttached to\ncar frame\nFIGURE 11-16 Automobile spring\nand shock absorber provide damping\nso that a car won\'t bounce up and\ndown so much.\nPiston\nViscous\nfluid\nAttached to\ncar axle\nFIGURE 11-17 These huge dampers\nplaced in a building look a lot like\nhuge automobile shock absorbers,\nand they serve a similar purpose-to\nreduce the amplitude and the\nacceleration of movement when the\nshock of an earthquake hits.\nSECTION 11-5 Damped Harmonic Motion 303\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 45, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'A\nAmplitude of\noscillating system\nB\nfo\nExternal frequency\nf\nFIGURE 11-18 Amplitude as a\nfunction of driving frequency f,\nshowing resonance for lightly\ndamped (A) and heavily damped (B)\nsystems.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nChild on a swing\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nShattering glass via resonance\nFIGURE 11-19 This goblet breaks as it\nvibrates in resonance to a trumpet call.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nResonant collapse\n11-6 Forced Oscillations; Resonance\nWhen an oscillating system is set into motion, it oscillates at its natural frequency\n(Eqs. 11-6b and 11-11b). However, a system may have an external force applied\nto it that has its own particular frequency. Then we have a forced oscillation.\nFor example, we might pull the mass on the spring of Fig. 11-1 back and forth\nat an externally applied frequency f. The mass then oscillates at the external fre-\nquency f of the external force, even if this frequency is different from the natural\nfrequency of the spring, which we will now denote by fo, where (see Eq. 11-6b)\nk\nf0 =\n1\n2TT Vm\n.\nFor a forced oscillation with only light damping, the amplitude of oscillation\nis found to depend on the difference between f and f0 , and is a maximum when\nthe frequency of the external force equals the natural frequency of the system-\nthat is, when f = fo. The amplitude is plotted in Fig. 11-18 as a function of the\nexternal frequency f. Curve A represents light damping and curve B heavy damp-\ning. When the external driving frequency f is near the natural frequency, f ~ fo,\nthe amplitude can become large if the damping is small. This effect of increased\namplitude at f = f0 is known as resonance. The natural oscillation frequency f0\nof a system is also called its resonant frequency.\nA simple illustration of resonance is pushing a child on a swing. A swing, like\nany pendulum, has a natural frequency of oscillation. If you push on the swing at\na random frequency, the swing bounces around and reaches no great amplitude.\nBut if you push with a frequency equal to the natural frequency of the swing, the\namplitude increases greatly. At resonance, relatively little effort is required to\nobtain and maintain a large amplitude.\nThe great tenor Enrico Caruso was said to be able to shatter a crystal goblet\nby singing a note of just the right frequency at full voice. This is an example of\nresonance, for the sound waves emitted by the voice act as a forced oscillation on\nthe glass. At resonance, the resulting oscillation of the goblet may be large enough\nin amplitude that the glass exceeds its elastic limit and breaks (Fig. 11-19).\nSince material objects are, in general, elastic, resonance is an important phe-\nnomenon in a variety of situations. It is particularly important in construction,\nalthough the effects are not always foreseen. For example, it has been reported\nthat a railway bridge collapsed because a nick in one of the wheels of a crossing\ntrain set up a resonant oscillation in the bridge. Marching soldiers break step when\ncrossing a bridge to avoid the possibility that their rhythmic march might match a\nresonant frequency of the bridge. The famous collapse of the Tacoma Narrows\nBridge (Fig. 11-20a) in 1940 occurred as a result of strong gusting winds driving\nthe span into large-amplitude oscillatory motion. Bridges and tall buildings are\nnow designed with more inherent damping. The Oakland freeway collapse in\nthe 1989 California earthquake (Fig. 11-20b) involved resonant oscillation of a\nsection built on mudfill that readily transmitted that frequency.\nResonance can be very useful, too, and we will meet important examples\nlater, such as in musical instruments and tuning a radio. We will also see that\nvibrating objects often have not one, but many resonant frequencies.\nFIGURE 11-20 (a) Large-amplitude\noscillations of the Tacoma Narrows\nBridge, due to gusty winds, led to its\ncollapse (November 7, 1940).\n(b) Collapse of a freeway in\nCalifornia, due to the 1989 earthquake.\n+\n(a)\n(b)\n304 CHAPTER 11 Oscillations and Waves\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 46, 'type': 'text', 'content': '11-7 Wave Motion\nWhen you throw a stone into a lake or pool of water, circular waves form and\nmove outward, Fig. 11-21. Waves will also travel along a rope that is stretched\nout straight on a table if you vibrate one end back and forth as shown in\nFig. 11-22. Water waves and waves on a rope or cord are two common examples\nof mechanical waves, which propagate as oscillations of matter. We will discuss\nother kinds of waves in later Chapters, including electromagnetic waves and light.\nVelocity of rope particle\nVelocity of wave\nFIGURE 11-21 Water waves\nspreading outward from a source.

They don\'t.+ Water waves move with a recognizable velocity. But each\nparticle (or molecule) of the water itself merely oscillates about an equilibrium\npoint. This is clearly demonstrated by observing leaves on a pond as waves move\nby. The leaves (or a cork) are not carried forward by the waves, but oscillate more\nor less up and down about an equilibrium point because this is the motion of the\nwater itself.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 11-10\nWave vs. particle velocity. Is the velocity\nof a wave moving along a rope the same as the velocity of a particle of the rope?\nSee Fig. 11-22.\nRESPONSE No. The two velocities are different, both in magnitude and direc-\ntion. The wave on the rope of Fig. 11-22 moves to the right along the tabletop,\nbut each piece of the rope only vibrates to and fro, perpendicular to the traveling\nwave. (The rope clearly does not travel in the direction that the wave on it does.)\nWaves can move over large distances, but the medium (the water or the rope)\nitself has only a limited movement, oscillating about an equilibrium point as in\nsimple harmonic motion. Thus, although a wave is not itself matter, the wave\npattern can travel in matter. A wave consists of oscillations that move without\ncarrying matter with them.\n+Do not be confused by the "breaking" of ocean waves, which occurs when a wave interacts with the\nground in shallow water and hence is no longer a simple wave.\nSECTION 11-7 Wave Motion 305\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 47, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Velocity of\nrope particle\nVelocity of wave\nFIGURE 11-22 (Repeated.)

All forms of traveling waves transport energy.\n-\nEXERCISE G Return to Chapter-Opening Question 2, page 292, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nLet us look more closely at how a wave is formed and how it comes to "travel."\nWe first look at a single wave bump, or pulse. A single pulse can be formed on\na cord by a quick up-and-down motion of the hand, Fig. 11-23. The hand pulls\nup on one end of the cord. Because the end section is attached to adjacent sections,\nthese also feel an upward force and they too begin to move upward. As each\nsucceeding section of cord moves upward, the wave crest moves outward along the\ncord. Meanwhile, the end section of cord has been returned to its original position\nby the hand. As each succeeding section of cord reaches its peak position, it too\nis pulled back down again by tension from the adjacent section of cord. Thus the\nsource of a traveling wave pulse is a disturbance (or vibration), and cohesive forces\nbetween adjacent sections of cord cause the pulse to travel. Waves in other media are\ncreated and propagate outward in a similar fashion. A dramatic example of a wave\npulse is a tsunami or tidal wave that is created by an earthquake in the Earth\'s crust\nunder the ocean. The bang you hear when a door slams is a sound wave pulse.\nA continuous or periodic wave, such as that shown in Fig. 11-22, has as its\nsource a disturbance that is continuous and oscillating; that is, the source is a\nvibration or oscillation. In Fig. 11-22, a hand oscillates one end of the rope.\nWater waves may be produced by any vibrating object at the surface, such as your\nhand; or the water itself is made to vibrate when wind blows across it or a rock\nis thrown into it. A vibrating tuning fork or drum membrane gives rise to sound\nwaves in air. We will see later that oscillating electric charges give rise to light\nwaves. Indeed, almost any vibrating object sends out waves.\nThe source of any wave, then, is a vibration. And it is a vibration that propa-\ngates outward and thus constitutes the wave. If the source vibrates sinusoidally\nin SHM, then the wave itself-if the medium is elastic-will have a sinusoidal\nshape both in space and in time. (1) In space: if you take a picture of the wave in\nspace at a given instant of time, the wave will have the shape of a sine or cosine as\na function of position. (2) In time: if you look at the motion of the medium at one\nplace over a long period of time-for example, if you look between two closely\nspaced posts of a pier or out of a ship\'s porthole as water waves pass by-the\nup-and-down motion of that small segment of water will be simple harmonic\nmotion. The water moves up and down sinusoidally in time.\nSome of the important quantities used to describe a periodic sinusoidal wave\nare shown in Fig. 11-24. The high points on a wave are called crests; the low points,\ntroughs. The amplitude, A, is the maximum height of a crest, or depth of a trough,\nrelative to the normal (or equilibrium) level. The total swing from a crest to a trough\nis 2A (twice the amplitude). The distance between two successive crests is the\nwavelength, À (the Greek letter lambda). The wavelength is also equal to the dis-\ntance between any two successive identical points on the wave. The frequency, f,\nis the number of crests-or complete cycles-that pass a given point per unit time.\nThe period, T, equals 1/f and is the time elapsed between two successive crests\npassing by the same point in space.\nCrest\nl\n4\nFIGURE 11-24 Characteristics of a\nsingle-frequency continuous wave\nmoving through space.\nAmplitude\nAmplitude\nTrough\nl\n306 CHAPTER 11 Oscillations and Waves\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 48, 'type': 'text', 'content': "The wave speed, v, is the speed at which wave crests (or any other fixed\npoint on the wave shape) move forward. The wave speed must be distinguished\nfrom the speed of a particle of the medium itself as we saw in Example 11-10.\nA wave crest travels a distance of one wavelength, À, in a time equal to one\nperiod, T. Thus the wave speed is v = \\/T. Then, since 1/T = f,\nv = Af.\n(11-12)\nFor example, suppose a wave has a wavelength of 5 m and a frequency of 3 Hz.\nSince three crests pass a given point per second, and the crests are 5 m apart, the\nfirst crest (or any other part of the wave) must travel a distance of 15 m during\nthe 1 s. So the wave speed is 15 m/s.\nEXERCISE H You notice a water wave pass by the end of a pier, with about 0.5 s\nbetween crests. Therefore (a) the frequency is 0.5 Hz; (b) the velocity is 0.5 m/s; (c) the\nwavelength is 0.5 m; (d) the period is 0.5 s.\n11-8 Types of Waves and Their Speeds:\nTransverse and Longitudinal\nWhen a wave travels down a cord-say, from left to right as in Fig. 11-22-the\nparticles of the cord vibrate back and forth in a direction transverse (that is, perpen-\ndicular) to the motion of the wave itself. Such a wave is called a transverse wave\n(Fig. 11-25a). There exists another type of wave known as a longitudinal wave. In a\nlongitudinal wave, the vibration of the particles of the medium is along the direction\nof the wave's motion. Longitudinal waves are readily formed on a stretched spring\nor Slinky by alternately compressing and expanding one end. This is shown in\nFig. 11-25b, and can be compared to the transverse wave in Fig. 11-25a. A series\nof compressions and expansions travel along the spring. The compressions are\nthose areas where the coils are momentarily close together. Expansions (sometimes\ncalled rarefactions) are regions where the coils are momentarily far apart. Compres-\nsions and expansions correspond to the crests and troughs of a transverse wave.\nI - Wavelength\n(a)\nCompression\nExpansion\nFIGURE 11-25\n(a) Transverse wave;\n(b) longitudinal wave.\n* Wavelength-\n(b)\nAn important example of a longitudinal wave is a sound wave in air. A vibrat-\ning drumhead, for instance, alternately compresses and expands the air in contact\nwith it, producing a longitudinal wave that travels outward in the air, as shown in\nFig. 11-26.\nAs in the case of transverse waves, each section of the medium in which a\nlongitudinal wave passes oscillates over a very small distance, whereas the wave\nitself can travel large distances. Wavelength, frequency, and wave speed all\nhave meaning for a longitudinal wave. The wavelength is the distance between\nsuccessive compressions (or between successive expansions), and frequency is\nthe number of compressions that pass a given point per second. The wave speed\nis the speed with which each compression appears to move; it is equal to the\nproduct of wavelength and frequency, v = Af (Eq. 11-12).\nFIGURE 11-26 Production of a\nsound wave, which is longitudinal,\nshown at two moments in time about\na half period (¿ T) apart.\nDrum\nmembrane\nCompression\nExpansion\nSECTION 11-8 Types of Waves and Their Speeds: Transverse and Longitudinal 307\n", 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 49, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'A longitudinal wave can be represented graphically by plotting the density of\nair molecules (or coils of a Slinky) versus position at a given instant, as shown in\nFig. 11-27.

Why? Because when the tension is greater, we expect\nthe speed to be greater since each segment of cord is in tighter contact with its\nneighbor. Also, the greater the mass per unit length, the more inertia the cord\nhas and the more slowly the wave would be expected to propagate.\nEXAMPLE 11-11\nWave along a wire.

Thus, a dolphin\ncan resolve objects on the order of a centimeter or larger in size.\nOther Waves\nBoth transverse and longitudinal waves are produced when an earthquake occurs.\nThe transverse waves that travel through the body of the Earth are called S waves\n(S for shear), and the longitudinal waves are called P waves (P for pressure) or\ncompression waves. Both longitudinal and transverse waves can travel through a\nsolid since the atoms or molecules can vibrate about their relatively fixed positions\nin any direction. But only longitudinal waves can propagate through a fluid,\nbecause any transverse motion would not experience any restoring force since\na fluid is readily deformable. This fact was used by geophysicists to infer that a\nportion of the Earth\'s core must be liquid: after an earthquake, longitudinal waves\nare detected diametrically across the Earth, but not transverse waves.\nBesides these two types of waves that can pass through the body of the Earth\n(or other substance), there can also be surface waves that travel along the bound-\nary between two materials. A wave on water is actually a surface wave that moves\non the boundary between water and air. The motion of each particle of water at\nthe surface is circular or elliptical (Fig. 11-29), so it is a combination of horizontal\nand vertical motions. Below the surface, there is also horizontal plus vertical\nmotion, as shown. At the bottom, the motion is only horizontal. (When a wave\napproaches shore, the water drags at the bottom and is slowed down, while the\ncrests move ahead at higher speed (Fig. 11-30) and "spill" over the top.)\nSurface waves are also set up on the Earth when an earthquake occurs. The\nwaves that travel along the surface are mainly responsible for the damage caused\nby earthquakes.\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nEarthquake waves\nB\nv\nFIGURE 11-29 A shallow water\nwave is an example of a surface wave,\nwhich is a combination of transverse\nand longitudinal wave motions.\nFIGURE 11-30 How a water wave\nbreaks.

Since the energy is\nproportional to the wave amplitude squared, so too is the intensity:\nI x A2.\n(11-15)\nIf a wave flows out from the source in all directions, it is a three-dimensional\nwave. Examples are sound traveling in open air, earthquake waves, and light waves.\nIf the medium is isotropic (same in all directions), the wave is a spherical wave\n(Fig. 11-31). As the wave moves outward, the energy it carries is spread over\na larger and larger area since the surface area of a sphere of radius r is 4Tr2.\nThus the intensity of a spherical wave is\narea\nIf the power output P of the source is constant, then the intensity decreases as\nthe inverse square of the distance from the source:\n1 x 1 .\n[spherical wave] (11-16b)\nThis is often called the inverse square law, or the "one over r2 law."

The area remains constant, so the amplitude A also remains constant (ignoring\nfriction). Thus the amplitude and the intensity do not decrease with distance.\nIn practice, frictional damping is generally present, and some of the energy\nis transformed into thermal energy. Thus the amplitude and intensity of a\none-dimensional wave will decrease with distance from the source. For a\nthree-dimensional wave, the decrease will be greater than that discussed above,\nmore than 1/r2, although the effect may often be small.\nIntensity Related to Amplitude and Frequency\nFor a sinusoidal wave of frequency f, the particles move in SHM as a wave\npasses, so each particle has an energy E = 2kA2, where A is the amplitude of\nits motion.

The heavier the second section of the cord, the less the energy\nthat is transmitted. (When the second section is a wall or rigid support, very little\nis transmitted and most is reflected, as in Fig. 11-33a.) For a sinusoidal wave, the\nfrequency of the transmitted wave does not change across the boundary because\nthe boundary point oscillates at that frequency. Thus if the transmitted wave has a\nlower speed, its wavelength is also less () = v/f).\nFor a two or three dimensional wave, such as a water wave, we are concerned\nwith wave fronts, by which we mean all the points along the wave forming the wave\ncrest (what we usually refer to simply as a "wave" at the seashore). A line drawn in\nthe direction of wave motion, perpendicular to the wave front, is called a ray, as\nshown in Fig. 11-35.

The angle of reflection is the corresponding angle (01) for the reflected wave.\n11-11\nInterference;\nPrinciple of Superposition\nInterference refers to what happens when two waves pass through the same region\nof space at the same time. Consider, for example, the two wave pulses on a cord\ntraveling toward each other as shown in Fig. 11-37 (time increases downward in\nboth a and b). In Fig. 11-37a the two pulses have the same amplitude, but one is\na crest and the other a trough; in Fig. 11-37b they are both crests. In both cases,\nthe waves meet and pass right by each other. However, in the region where they\noverlap, the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum of their separate displace-\nments (a crest is considered positive and a trough negative). This is the principle of\nsuperposition. In Fig. 11-37a, the two waves have opposite displacements at the\ninstant they pass one another, and they add to zero. The result is called destructive\ninterference. In Fig. 11-37b, at the instant the two pulses overlap, they produce a\nresultant displacement that is greater than the displacement of either separate\npulse, and the result is constructive interference.\nYou may wonder where the energy is at the moment of destructive interfer-\nence in Fig. 11-37a; the cord may be straight at this instant, but the central parts\nof it are still moving up or down (kinetic energy).\n(a)\n(b)\nPulses far apart,\napproaching\nPulses overlap\nprecisely\n(for an instant)\nV\nTime\nFIGURE 11-37 Two wave pulses\npass each other.

Destructive interference ("flat water") occurs where one\nwave\'s maximum (a crest) meets the other\'s miminum (a trough).\nWhen two rocks are thrown into a pond simultaneously, the two sets of circu-\nlar waves that move outward interfere with one another as shown in Fig. 11-38a. In\nsome areas of overlap, crests of one wave repeatedly meet crests of the other (and\ntroughs meet troughs), Fig. 11-38b. Constructive interference is occurring at these\npoints, and the water continuously oscillates up and down with greater amplitude\nthan either wave separately. In other areas, destructive interference occurs where the\nwater does not move up and down at all over time. This is where crests of one wave\nmeet troughs of the other, and vice versa. Figure 11-39a shows the displacement\nof two identical waves graphically as a function of time, as well as their sum, for\nthe case of constructive interference. For any two such waves, we use the term\nphase to describe the relative positions of their crests. When the crests and troughs\nare aligned as in Fig. 11-39a, for constructive interference, the two waves are in phase.\nAt points where destructive interference occurs (Fig. 11-39b), crests of one wave\nrepeatedly meet troughs of the other wave and the two waves are said to be\ncompletely out of phase or, more precisely, out of phase by one-half wavelength (or\n180°) .* That is, the crests of one wave occur a half wavelength behind the crests of the\nother wave. The relative phase of the two water waves in Fig. 11-38 in most areas\nis intermediate between these two extremes, resulting in partially destructive\ninterference, as illustrated in Fig. 11-39c.

As you continue to oscillate the cord, waves will travel in both direc-\ntions, and the wave traveling along the cord, away from your hand, will interfere\nwith the reflected wave coming back. Usually there will be quite a jumble. But\nif you oscillate the cord at just the right frequency, the two traveling waves will\ninterfere in such a way that a large-amplitude standing wave will be produced,\nFig. 11-40. It is called a "standing wave" because it does not appear to be traveling.\nThe cord simply appears to have segments that oscillate up and down in a fixed\npattern. The points of destructive interference, where the cord remains still at\nall times, are called nodes. Points of constructive interference, where the cord\noscillates with maximum amplitude, are called antinodes. The nodes and antinodes\nremain in fixed positions for a particular frequency.\nStanding waves can occur at more than one frequency. The lowest frequency\nof oscillation that produces a standing wave gives rise to the pattern shown in\nFig. 11-40a. The standing waves shown in Figs. 11-40b and 11-40c are produced\nat precisely twice and three times the lowest frequency, respectively, assuming\nthe tension in the cord is the same. The cord can also oscillate with four loops\n(four antinodes) at four times the lowest frequency, and so on.\nThe frequencies at which standing waves are produced are the natural\nfrequencies or resonant frequencies of the cord, and the different standing wave\npatterns shown in Fig. 11-40 are different "resonant modes of vibration." A stand-\ning wave on a cord is the result of the interference of two waves traveling in\nopposite directions. A standing wave can also be considered a vibrating object at\nresonance. Standing waves represent the same phenomenon as the resonance of\nan oscillating spring or pendulum, which we discussed in Section 11-6. However,\na spring or pendulum has only one resonant frequency, whereas the cord has\nan infinite number of resonant frequencies, each of which is a whole-number\nmultiple of the lowest resonant frequency.\nConsider a string stretched between two supports that is plucked like a guitar\nor violin string, Fig. 11-41a. Waves of a great variety of frequencies will travel in\nboth directions along the string, will be reflected at the ends, and will travel back\nin the opposite direction. Most of these waves interfere with each other and\nquickly die out. However, those waves that correspond to the resonant frequen-\ncies of the string will persist. The ends of the string, since they are fixed, will be\nnodes. There may be other nodes as well. Some of the possible resonant modes of\nvibration (standing waves) are shown in Fig. 11-41b. Generally, the motion will\nbe a combination of these different resonant modes, but only those frequencies\nthat correspond to a resonant frequency will be present.\nAntinode\nNode\n(a)\nAntinode\nNode\n(b)\nNode Antinode\n(c)\nFIGURE 11-40 Standing waves\ncorresponding to three resonant\nfrequencies.\nFIGURE 11-41 (a) A string is plucked.

The\nlowest frequency, called the fundamental frequency, corresponds to one antinode\n(or loop). And as can be seen in Fig. 11-41b, the whole length corresponds to\none-half wavelength. Thus l = 211, where A1 stands for the wavelength of the\nfundamental frequency. The other natural frequencies are called overtones; for a\nvibrating string they are whole-number (integral) multiples of the fundamental,\nand then are also called harmonics, with the fundamental being referred to as the\nfirst harmonic.+ The next mode of vibration after the fundamental has two loops\nand is called the second harmonic (or first overtone), Fig. 11-41b. The length of\nthe string l at the second harmonic corresponds to one complete wavelength:\nl = 12. For the third and fourth harmonics, l = 213, and ( = 4 ×4 = 2\\4, respec-\ntively, and so on. In general, we can write\ne = mAn ,\nwhere n = 1, 2, 3, ....\nThe integer n labels the number of the harmonic: n = 1 for the fundamental,\nn = 2 for the second harmonic, and so on.

We see that each resonant\nfrequency is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency on a vibrating string.\nBecause a standing wave is equivalent to two traveling waves moving in\nopposite directions, the concept of wave velocity still makes sense and is given by\nEq. 11-13 in terms of the tension Fr in the string and its mass per unit length\n(u = m/l). That is, v = VFr/u for waves traveling in either direction.\nEXAMPLE 11-14\nPiano string. A piano string 1.10 m long has mass 9.00 g.\n(a) How much tension must the string be under if it is to vibrate at a fundamental\nfrequency of 131 Hz? (b) What are the frequencies of the first four harmonics?\nAPPROACH To determine the tension, we need to find the wave speed using\nEq. 11-12 (v = Af), and then use Eq. 11-13, solving it for FT .\nSOLUTION (a) The wavelength of the fundamental is À = 20 = 2.20 m\n(Eq. 11-19a with n = 1). The speed of the wave on the string is v = Af =\n(2.20 m)(131 s-1) = 288 m/s.

The\nfrequencies of the second, third, and fourth harmonics are two, three, and four\ntimes the fundamental frequency: 262, 393, and 524 Hz, respectively.\nNOTE The speed of the wave on the string is not the same as the speed of the\nsound wave that the piano string produces in the air (as we shall see in Chapter 12).\nA standing wave does appear to be standing in place (and a traveling wave\nappears to move). The term "standing" wave is also meaningful from the point of\nview of energy. Since the string is at rest at the nodes, no energy flows past these\npoints. Hence the energy is not transmitted down the string but "stands" in place\nin the string.\nStanding waves are produced not only on strings, but also on any object that is\nstruck, such as a drum membrane or an object made of metal or wood. The resonant\nfrequencies depend on the dimensions of the object, just as for a string they depend\non its length. Large objects have lower resonant frequencies than small objects.\n*The term "harmonic" comes from music, because such integral multiples of frequencies "harmonize."\n316 CHAPTER 11\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 58, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'All musical instruments, from stringed to wind instruments (in which a column of air\noscillates as a standing wave) to drums and other percussion instruments, depend on\nstanding waves to produce their particular musical sounds, as we shall see in Chapter 12.\n*\n11-13 Refraction\nWhen any wave strikes a boundary, some of the energy is reflected and some is\ntransmitted or absorbed. When a two- or three-dimensional wave traveling in one\nmedium crosses a boundary into a medium where its speed is different, the trans-\nmitted wave may move in a different direction than the incident wave, as shown\nin Fig. 11-42. This phenomenon is known as refraction. One example is a water\nwave; the velocity decreases in shallow water and the waves refract, as shown in\nFig. 11-43. [When the wave velocity changes gradually, as in Fig. 11-43, without\na sharp boundary, the waves change direction (refract) gradually.]\nIn Fig. 11-42, the velocity of the wave in medium 2 is less than in medium 1.\nIn this case, the wave front bends so that it travels more nearly parallel to the\nboundary. That is, the angle of refraction, Or , is less than the angle of incidence, 0; .\nTo see why this is so, and to help us get a quantitative relation between 0r and 0;,\nlet us think of each wave front as a row of soldiers. The soldiers are marching\nfrom firm ground (medium 1) into mud (medium 2) and hence are slowed down\nafter the boundary. The soldiers that reach the mud first are slowed down first,\nand the row bends as shown in Fig. 11-44a. Let us consider the wave front (or\nrow of soldiers) labeled A in Fig. 11-44b. In the same time t that A1 moves a\ndistance (1 = Vit, we see that A2 moves a distance (2 = 02t. The two right triangles\nin Fig. 11-44b, shaded yellow and green, have the side labeled a in common. Thus\nsin 01 = = 0,1\nsince a is the hypotenuse, and\nsin 02 = 2 = 32 .\nDividing these two equations, we obtain the law of refraction:\nsin 02\nsin Q = 02 .\n01\n(11-20)\nSince 01 is the angle of incidence (0;), and 02 is the angle of refraction (or),\nEq. 11-20 gives the quantitative relation between the two. If the wave were going\nin the opposite direction, the geometry would not change; only 01 and 02 would\nchange roles: 02 would be the angle of incidence and 01 the angle of refraction.\nThus, if the wave travels into a medium where it can move faster, it will bend\nthe opposite way, Or > 0 ;. We see from Eq. 11-20 that if the velocity increases,\nthe angle increases, and vice versa.\nIncident\nray\nIncident waves\n1\n2\nWave fronts\nRefracted waves\nRefracted ray\n-\nFIGURE 11-42 Refraction of waves\npassing a boundary.\nFIGURE 11-43 Water waves refract\ngradually as they approach the\nshore, as their velocity decreases.\nThere is no distinct boundary, as in\nFig. 11-42, because the wave\nvelocity changes gradually.\n*This Section and the next are covered in more detail in Chapters 23 and 24 on optics.\nFIGURE 11-44 (a) Marching soldier analogy to derive\n(b) law of refraction for waves.\n1\nFirm\nground\nA1\n1,\nRow of soldiers\nA2\nA\na\nMud\n-\n02\n(a)\n-\nA\n(b)\n*SECTION 11-13 317\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 59, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'PHYSICS APPLIED\nEarthquake wave refraction\nEarthquake waves refract within the Earth as they travel through rock layers\nof different densities (which have different velocities) just as water waves do.

Then notice in part (d), where the\nobstacle is the same as in part (c) but the wavelength is longer, that there is more\ndiffraction into the shadow region. As a rule of thumb, only if the wavelength\nis smaller than the size of the object will there be a significant shadow region.\nThis rule applies to reflection from an obstacle as well.

At t = 0, the wave shape shown is\ny = A sin x,\n(11-21)\nwhere y is the displacement of the wave (either longitudinal or transverse)\nat position x, À is the wavelength, and A is the amplitude of the wave.\n[Equation 11-21 works because it repeats itself every wavelength: when x = À,\ny = sin 2Tr = sin 0.]\nSuppose the wave is moving to the right with speed v. After a time t, each\npart of the wave (indeed, the whole wave "shape") has moved to the right a dis-\ntance vt. Figure 11-48 shows the wave at t = 0 as a solid curve, and at a later\ntime t as a dashed curve. Consider any point on the wave at t = 0: say, a crest\nat some position x. After a time t, that crest will have traveled a distance vt, so\nits new position is a distance vt greater than its old position. To describe this\ncrest (or other point on the wave shape), the argument of the sine function must\nhave the same numerical value, so we replace x in Eq. 11-21 by (x - vt):\ny = A sin\n1\n2TT\n(x - vt) .\n(11-22)\ny\nl\n0\nx\nA\nl\nFIGURE 11-47 The characteristics\nof a single-frequency wave at t = 0\n(just as in Fig. 11-24).\nFIGURE 11-48 A traveling wave. In\ntime t, the wave moves a distance vt.\ny\nut\nA\nwave at\nt=0\nwave at\ntime t\nx\n1 --\nSaid another way, if you are on a crest, as t increases, x must increase at the same\nrate so that (x - vt) remains constant.\nFor a wave traveling along the x axis to the left, toward decreasing values of x,\nv becomes -v, so\ny = A sin\n20 (x + vt).\nSummary\nAn oscillating (or vibrating) object undergoes simple harmonic\nmotion (SHM) if the restoring force is proportional to (the\nnegative of) the displacement,\nF = - kx.\n(11-1)\nThe maximum displacement from equilibrium is called the\namplitude.\nThe period, T, is the time required for one complete cycle\n(back and forth), and the frequency, f, is the number of cycles\nper second; they are related by\nf = 4.\nT\n(11-2)\nThe period of oscillation for a mass m on the end of a\nspring is given by\nm\n.\nT = 2m.\nk\n(11-6a)\nSHM is sinusoidal, which means that the displacement as\na function of time follows a sine curve.\nDuring SHM, the total energy\nE = mv2 + 1kx2\n(11-3)\nis continually changing from potential to kinetic and back\nagain.\nA simple pendulum of length & approximates SHM if its\namplitude is small and friction can be ignored. For small ampli-\ntudes, its period is given by\nT = 27 1\ng\n(11-11a)\nl\n,\nwhere g is the acceleration of gravity.\nWhen friction is present (for all real springs and pendulums),\nthe motion is said to be damped. The maximum displacement\ndecreases in time, and the mechanical energy is eventually all\ntransformed to thermal energy.\nIf a varying force of frequency f is applied to a system capable\nof oscillating, the amplitude of oscillation can be very large if the\nfrequency of the applied force is near the natural (or resonant)\nfrequency of the oscillator. This is called resonance.\nVibrating objects act as sources of waves that travel\noutward from the source. Waves on water and on a cord are\nexamples. The wave may be a pulse (a single crest), or it may\nbe continuous (many crests and troughs).\nThe wavelength of a continuous sinusoidal wave is the dis-\ntance between two successive crests.\nThe frequency is the number of full wavelengths (or crests)\nthat pass a given point per unit time.\nThe amplitude of a wave is the maximum height of a crest,\nor depth of a trough, relative to the normal (or equilibrium)\nlevel.\nSummary 319\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 61, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The wave speed (how fast a crest moves) is equal to the\nproduct of wavelength and frequency,\nv = Af.\n(11-12)\nIn a transverse wave, the oscillations are perpendicular to\nthe direction in which the wave travels. An example is a wave\non a cord.\nIn a longitudinal wave, the oscillations are along (parallel\nto) the line of travel; sound is an example.\nWaves carry energy from place to place without matter\nbeing carried. The intensity of a wave is the energy per unit time\ncarried across unit area (in watts/m2). For three-dimensional\nwaves traveling outward from a point source, the intensity\ndecreases inversely as the square of the distance from the source\n(ignoring damping):\n1 x 1.\n(11-16b)\nWave intensity is proportional to the amplitude squared\nand to the frequency squared.\nWaves reflect off objects in their path. When the wave front\n(of a two- or three-dimensional wave) strikes an object, the\nangle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. This is\nthe law of reflection. When a wave strikes a boundary between\ntwo materials in which it can travel, part of the wave is reflected\nand part is transmitted.\nQuestions\n1. Is the acceleration of a simple harmonic oscillator ever\nzero? If so, where?\n2. Real springs have mass. Will the true period and frequency\nbe larger or smaller than given by the equations for a mass\noscillating on the end of an idealized massless spring?\nExplain.\n3. How could you double the maximum speed of a simple\nharmonic oscillator (SHO)?\n4. If a pendulum clock is accurate at sea level, will it gain or\nlose time when taken to high altitude? Why?\n5. A tire swing hanging from a branch reaches nearly to the\nground (Fig. 11-49). How could you estimate the height\nof the branch using only a stopwatch?\nFIGURE 11-49 Question 5.\nWhen two waves pass through the same region of space\nat the same time, they interfere. The resultant displacement at\nany point and time is the sum of their separate displacements\n(= the superposition principle). This can result in constructive\ninterference, destructive interference, or something in between,\ndepending on the amplitudes and relative phases of the waves.\nWaves traveling on a string of fixed length interfere with\nwaves that have reflected off the end and are traveling back in\nthe opposite direction. At certain frequencies, standing waves can\nbe produced in which the waves seem to be standing still rather\nthan traveling. The string (or other medium) is vibrating as a\nwhole. This is a resonance phenomenon, and the frequencies\nat which standing waves occur are called resonant frequencies.\nPoints of destructive interference (no oscillation) are called\nnodes. Points of constructive interference (maximum amplitude\nof vibration) are called antinodes.\n[*Waves change direction, or refract, when traveling from\none medium into a second medium where their speed is different.\nWaves spread, or diffract, as they travel and encounter obstacles.\nA rough guide to the amount of diffraction is 0 ~ A/l, where\nÀ is the wavelength and & the width of an obstacle or opening.\nThere is a significant "shadow region" only if the wavelength >\nis smaller than the size of the obstacle.]\n[*A traveling wave can be represented mathematically as\ny = A sin { (2m/A) (x + vt) } .]\n6. For a simple harmonic oscillator, when (if ever) are the\ndisplacement and velocity vectors in the same direction?\nWhen are the displacement and acceleration vectors in the\nsame direction?\n7. Two equal masses are attached to separate identical springs\nnext to one another. One mass is pulled so its spring stretches\n40 cm and the other is pulled so its spring stretches only\n20 cm. The masses are released simultaneously. Which mass\nreaches the equilibrium point first?\n8. What is the approximate period of your walking step?\n9. What happens to the period of a playground swing if you\nrise up from sitting to a standing position?\n10. Why can you make water slosh back and forth in a pan\nonly if you shake the pan at a certain frequency?\n11. Is the frequency of a simple periodic wave equal to the\nfrequency of its source? Why or why not?\n12. Explain the difference between the speed of a transverse\nwave traveling along a cord and the speed of a tiny piece\nof the cord.\n13. What kind of waves do you think will travel along a hori-\nzontal metal rod if you strike its end (a) vertically from\nabove and (b) horizontally parallel to its length?\n14. Since the density of air decreases with an increase in tem-\nperature, but the bulk modulus B is nearly independent of\ntemperature, how would you expect the speed of sound\nwaves in air to vary with temperature?\n15. If a rope has a free end, a pulse sent down the rope\nbehaves differently on reflection than if the rope has that\nend fixed in position. What is this difference, and why does\nit occur?\n16. How did geophysicists determine that part of the Earth\'s\ninterior is liquid?\n320 CHAPTER 11 Oscillations and Waves\n', 'chapter_title': '10-1 Phases of Matter'}, {'page_number': 62, 'type': 'text', 'content': '17. The speed of sound in most solids is somewhat greater\nthan in air, yet the density of solids is much greater (103 to\n104 times). Explain.\n18. Give two reasons why circular water waves decrease in\namplitude as they travel away from the source.\n19. Two linear waves have the same amplitude and speed, and\notherwise are identical, except one has half the wavelength\nof the other. Which transmits more energy? By what factor?\n20. When a sinusoidal wave crosses the boundary between two\nsections of cord as in Fig. 11-34, the frequency does not\nchange (although the wavelength and velocity do change).\nExplain why.\n21.

When a standing wave exists on a string, the vibrations of\nincident and reflected waves cancel at the nodes. Does this\nmean that energy was destroyed? Explain.\n25. Can the amplitude of the standing waves in Fig. 11-40 be\ngreater than the amplitude of the vibrations that cause them\n(up and down motion of the hand)?\n26. "In a round bowl of water, waves move from the center\nto the rim, or from the rim to the center, depending on\nwhether you strike at the center or at the rim."
