We can control the flow of charge using electric fields and\nelectric potential (voltage), concepts we have just been discussing. In order to\nhave a current in a wire, a potential difference is needed, which can be provided\nby a battery.\nWe first look at electric current from a macroscopic point of view. Later in\nthe Chapter we look at currents from a microscopic (theoretical) point of view as\na flow of electrons in a wire.\nFIGURE 18-1 Alessandro Volta.\nIn this portrait, Volta demonstrates\nhis battery to Napoleon in 1801.\nFIGURE 18-2 A voltaic battery,\nfrom Volta\'s original publication.\n18-1 The Electric Battery\nUntil the year 1800, the technical development of electricity consisted mainly of\nproducing a static charge by friction. It all changed in 1800 when Alessandro\nVolta (1745-1827; Fig. 18-1) invented the electric battery, and with it produced\nthe first steady flow of electric charge-that is, a steady electric current.\nThe events that led to the discovery of the battery are interesting. Not only\nwas this an important discovery, but it also gave rise to a famous scientific\ndebate.\nIn the 1780s, Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), professor at the University of Bologna,\ncarried out a series of experiments on the contraction of a frog\'s leg muscle by using\nstatic electricity. Galvani found that the muscle also contracted when dissimilar\nmetals were inserted into the frog. Galvani believed that the source of the electric\ncharge was in the frog muscle or nerve itself, and that the metal merely transmitted\nthe charge to the proper points. When he published his work in 1791, he termed\nthis charge "animal electricity." Many wondered, including Galvani himself, if he\nhad discovered the long-sought "life-force."\nVolta, at the University of Pavia 200 km away, was skeptical of Galvani\'s\nresults, and came to believe that the source of the electricity was not in the animal\nitself, but rather in the contact between the dissimilar metals. Volta realized that\na moist conductor, such as a frog muscle or moisture at the contact point of two\ndissimilar metals, was necessary in the circuit if it was to be effective. He also saw\nthat the contracting frog muscle was a sensitive instrument for detecting electric\n"tension" or "electromotive force" (his words for what we now call voltage), in\nfact more sensitive than the best available electroscopes that he and others had\ndeveloped.+\nVolta\'s research found that certain combinations of metals produced a greater\neffect than others, and, using his measurements, he listed them in order of effec-\ntiveness. (This "electrochemical series" is still used by chemists today.) He also\nfound that carbon could be used in place of one of the metals.\nVolta then conceived his greatest contribution to science. Between a disc of\nzinc and one of silver, he placed a piece of cloth or paper soaked in salt solution\nor dilute acid and piled a "battery" of such couplings, one on top of another, as\nshown in Fig. 18-2. This "pile" or "battery" produced a much increased potential\ndifference. Indeed, when strips of metal connected to the two ends of the pile\nwere brought close, a spark was produced. Volta had designed and built the first\nelectric battery. He published his discovery in 1800.\n+Volta\'s most sensitive electroscope (Section 16-4) measured about 40 V per degree (angle of leaf\nseparation). Nonetheless, he was able to estimate the potential differences produced by combina-\ntions of dissimilar metals in contact. For a silver-zinc contact he got about 0.7 V, remarkably close to\ntoday\'s value of 0.78 V.\n502 CHAPTER 18 Electric Currents\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': '+\n–\n–\nElectric Cells and Batteries\nA battery produces electricity by transforming chemical energy into electrical\nenergy. Today a great variety of electric cells and batteries are available, from\nflashlight batteries to the storage battery of a car. The simplest batteries contain\ntwo plates or rods made of dissimilar metals (one can be carbon) called electrodes.\nThe electrodes are immersed in a solution or paste, such as a dilute acid, called\nthe electrolyte. Such a device is properly called an electric cell, and several cells\nconnected together is a battery, although today even a single cell is called a\nbattery. The chemical reactions involved in most electric cells are quite complicated.\nHere we describe how one very simple cell works, emphasizing the physical aspects.\nThe cell shown in Fig. 18-3 uses dilute sulfuric acid as the electrolyte. One of\nthe electrodes is made of carbon, the other of zinc. The part of each electrode\noutside the solution is called the terminal, and connections to wires and circuits\nare made here. The acid tends to dissolve the zinc electrode. Each zinc atom leaves\ntwo electrons behind on the electrode and enters the solution as a positive ion. The\nzinc electrode thus acquires a negative charge. The electrolyte becomes positively\ncharged, and can pull electrons off the carbon electrode. Thus the carbon electrode\nbecomes positively charged. Because there is an opposite charge on the two elec-\ntrodes, there is a potential difference between the two terminals.\nIn a cell whose terminals are not connected, only a small amount of the zinc\nis dissolved, for as the zinc electrode becomes increasingly negative, any new\npositive zinc ions produced are attracted back to the electrode. Thus, a particular\npotential difference (or voltage) is maintained between the two terminals. If charge\nis allowed to flow between the terminals, say, through a wire (or a lightbulb),\nthen more zinc can be dissolved. After a time, one or the other electrode is used up\nand the cell becomes "dead."\nThe voltage that exists between the terminals of a battery depends on what the\nelectrodes are made of and their relative ability to be dissolved or give up electrons.\nWhen two or more cells are connected so that the positive terminal of one is\nconnected to the negative terminal of the next, they are said to be connected\nin series and their voltages add up. Thus, the voltage between the ends of two\n1.5-V AA flashlight batteries connected in series is 3.0 V, whereas the six 2-V cells\nof an automobile storage battery give 12 V. Figure 18-4a shows a diagram of a\ncommon "dry cell" or "flashlight battery" used not only in flashlights but in many\nportable electronic devices, and Fig. 18-4b shows two smaller ones connected in\nseries to a flashlight bulb. An incandescent lightbulb consists of a thin, coiled\nwire (filament) inside an evacuated glass bulb, as shown in Fig. 18-5 and in the\nChapter-Opening Photos, page 501. When charge passes through the filament, it gets\nvery hot (~ 2800 K) and glows. Other bulb types, such as fluorescent, work differently.\nFIGURE 18-4 (a) Diagram of an ordinary dry cell (like a D-cell\nor AA). The cylindrical zinc cup is covered on the sides; its flat\nbottom is the negative terminal. (b) Two dry cells (AA type)\nconnected in series.

(b) Schematic drawing of the\nsame circuit, consisting of a battery,\nconnecting wires (thick gray lines),\nand a lightbulb or other device.\nCAUTION\nA battery does not create charge;\na lightbulb does not destroy charge\nElectric Cars\nConsiderable research is being done to improve batteries for electric cars and for\nhybrids (which use both a gasoline internal combustion engine and an electric\nmotor). One type of battery is lithium-ion, in which the anode contains lithium\nand the cathode is carbon. Electric cars need no gear changes and can develop\nfull torque starting from rest, and so can accelerate quickly and smoothly. The\ndistance an electric car can go between charges of the battery (its "range") is an\nimportant parameter because each recharging of an electric car battery may take\nhours, not minutes like a gas fill-up. Because charging an electric car can draw\na large current over a period of several hours, electric power companies\nmay need to upgrade their power grids so they won\'t fail when many electric cars\nare being charged at the same time in a small urban area.\n18-2 Electric Current\nThe purpose of a battery is to produce a potential difference, which can then\nmake charges move. When a continuous conducting path is connected between\nthe terminals of a battery, we have an electric circuit, Fig. 18-6a. On any diagram\nof a circuit, as in Fig. 18-6b, we use the symbol\nor\n+\n[battery symbol]\nto represent a battery. The device connected to the battery could be a lightbulb,\na heater, a radio, or some other device. When such a circuit is formed, charge can\nmove (or flow) through the wires of the circuit, from one terminal of the battery\nto the other, as long as the conducting path is continuous. Any flow of charge\nsuch as this is called an electric current.\nMore precisely, the electric current in a wire is defined as the net amount of\ncharge that passes through the wire\'s full cross section at any point per unit time.\nThus, the current I is defined as\nI = AQ,\nAt\n(18-1)\nwhere AQ is the amount of charge that passes through the conductor at any loca-\ntion during the time interval At.\nElectric current is measured in coulombs per second; this is given a special\nname, the ampere (abbreviated amp or A), after the French physicist André Ampère\n(1775-1836). Thus, 1 A = 1 C/s. Smaller units of current are often used, such as\nthe milliampere (1 mA = 10-3 A) and microampere (1 uA = 10-6 A).\nA current can flow in a circuit only if there is a continuous conducting path.\nWe then have a complete circuit. If there is a break in the circuit, say, a cut wire,\nwe call it an open circuit and no current flows. In any single circuit, with only a single\npath for current to follow such as in Fig. 18-6b, a steady current at any instant is the\nsame at one point (say, point A) as at any other point (such as B). This follows\nfrom the conservation of electric charge: charge doesn\'t disappear. A battery does\nnot create (or destroy) any net charge, nor does a lightbulb absorb or destroy charge.\nEXAMPLE 18-1\nCurrent is flow of charge. A steady current of 2.5 A exists\nin a wire for 4.0 min. (a) How much total charge passes by a given point in the\ncircuit during those 4.0 min? (b) How many electrons would this be?\nAPPROACH (a) Current is flow of charge per unit time, Eq. 18-1, so the amount of\ncharge passing a point is the product of the current and the time interval. (b) To get\nthe number of electrons, we divide the total charge by the charge on one electron.\nSOLUTION (a) Since the current was 2.5 A, or 2.5 C/s, then in 4.0 min (= 240 s)\nthe total charge that flowed past a given point in the wire was, from Eq. 18-1,\n4Q = I At = (2.5 C/s)(240 s) = 600 C.\n(b) The charge on one electron is 1.60 × 10-19 C, so 600 C would consist of\n600 C\n= 3.8 × 1021 electrons.\n1.6 × 10-19 C/electron\n504 CHAPTER 18\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': '+\nEXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 18-2\nHow to connect a battery. What is wrong\nwith each of the schemes shown in Fig. 18-7 for lighting a flashlight bulb with a\nflashlight battery and a single wire?\n(a)\n–\nRESPONSE (a) There is no closed path for charge to flow around. Charges\nmight briefly start to flow from the battery toward the lightbulb, but there they\nrun into a "dead end," and the flow would immediately come to a stop.\n(b) Now there is a closed path passing to and from the lightbulb; but the wire\ntouches only one battery terminal, so there is no potential difference in the cir-\ncuit to make the charge move. Neither here, nor in (a), does the bulb light up.\n(c) Nothing is wrong here. This is a complete circuit: charge can flow out from\none terminal of the battery, through the wire and the bulb, and into the other\nterminal. This scheme will light the bulb.\n+\n(b)\n–\nIn many real circuits, wires are connected to a common conductor that pro-\nvides continuity. This common conductor is called ground, usually represented as\nor , and really is connected to the ground for a building or house. In a car,\none terminal of the battery is called "ground," but is not connected to the earth\nitself-it is connected to the frame of the car, as is one connection to each lightbulb\nand other devices. Thus the car frame is a conductor in each circuit, ensuring a\ncontinuous path for charge flow, and is called "ground" for the car\'s circuits.\n(Note that the car frame is well insulated from the earth by the rubber tires.)\nWe saw in Chapter 16 that conductors contain many free electrons. Thus, if a\ncontinuous conducting wire is connected to the terminals of a battery, negatively\ncharged electrons flow in the wire. When the wire is first connected, the potential\ndifference between the terminals of the battery sets up an electric field inside the\nwire and parallel to it. Free electrons at one end of the wire are attracted into\nthe positive terminal, and at the same time other electrons enter the other end of the\nwire at the negative terminal of the battery. There is a continuous flow of electrons\nthroughout the wire that begins as soon as the wire is connected to both terminals.\nWhen the conventions of positive and negative charge were invented two\ncenturies ago, however, it was assumed that positive charge flowed in a wire.\nFor nearly all purposes, positive charge flowing in one direction is exactly\nequivalent to negative charge flowing in the opposite direction, as shown in\nFig. 18-8. Today, we still use the historical convention of positive charge flow when\ndiscussing the direction of a current. So when we speak of the current direction\nin a circuit, we mean the direction positive charge would flow. This is sometimes\nreferred to as conventional current. When we want to speak of the direction of\nelectron flow, we will specifically state it is the electron current. In liquids and\ngases, both positive and negative charges (ions) can move.\nIn practical life, such as rating the total charge of a car battery, you may see\nthe unit ampere-hour (A . h): from Eq. 18-1, AQ = I At.\n| EXERCISE B How many coulombs is 1.00 A · h?\n18-3 Ohm\'s Law: Resistance and Resistors\nTo produce an electric current in a circuit, a difference in potential is required.\nOne way of producing a potential difference along a wire is to connect its ends to\nthe opposite terminals of a battery. It was Georg Simon Ohm (1787-1854) who\nestablished experimentally that the current in a metal wire is proportional to the\npotential difference V applied to its two ends:\nI x V.\n+\n(c)\n–\nFIGURE 18-7 Example 18-2.\nFIGURE 18-8 Conventional current\nfrom + to - is equivalent to a\nnegative electron flow from - to +.\nConventional\ncurrent\nElectron\nflow\nDevice\nConventional current\n+\nElectron current\n–\nCAUTION\nDistinguish conventional current\nfrom electron flow\nIf, for example, we connect a wire to the two terminals of a 6-V battery, the cur-\nrent in the wire will be twice what it would be if the wire were connected to a 3-V\nbattery. It is also found that reversing the sign of the voltage does not affect the\nmagnitude of the current.\nSECTION 18-3 505\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'OHM\'S "LAW"\nI\nAI _ 1\nAVER\n5= slope\n(a)\n0\n-V\nI\n-V\n(b)\n0\nFIGURE 18-9 Graphs of current vs.\nvoltage (a) for a metal conductor\nwhich obeys Ohm\'s law, and (b) for\na nonohmic device, in this case a\nsemiconductor diode.\nFIGURE 18-10 Flashlight\n(Example 18-3). Note how the circuit\nis completed along the side strip.\n1.5 Vlion\noff\nExactly how large the current is in a wire depends not only on the voltage\nbetween its ends, but also on the resistance the wire offers to the flow of electrons.\nElectron flow is impeded because of collisions with the atoms of the wire. We\ndefine electrical resistance R as the proportionality factor between the voltage V\n(between the ends of the wire) and the current I (passing through the wire):\nV = IR.\n(18-2)\nOhm found experimentally that in metal conductors R is a constant independent\nof V, a result known as Ohm\'s law. Equation 18-2, V = IR, is itself sometimes\ncalled Ohm\'s law, but only when referring to materials or devices for which R is\na constant independent of V. But R is not a constant for many substances\nother than metals, nor for devices such as diodes, vacuum tubes, transistors, and\nso on. Even for metals, R is not constant if the temperature changes much: for\na lightbulb filament the measured resistance is low for small currents, but\nis much higher at the filament\'s normal large operating current that puts it\nat the high temperature needed to make it glow (~3000 K). Thus Ohm\'s\n"law" is not a fundamental law of nature, but rather a description of a certain\nclass of materials: metal conductors, whose temperature does not change much.\nSuch materials are said to be "ohmic." Materials or devices that do not follow\nOhm\'s law are said to be nonohmic. See Fig. 18-9.\nThe unit for resistance is called the ohm and is abbreviated 22 (Greek capital\nletter omega). Because R = V/I, we see that 1.0 0 is equivalent to 1.0 V/A.\nEXAMPLE 18-3\nFlashlight bulb resistance. A small flashlight bulb (Fig. 18-10)\ndraws 300 mA from its 1.5-V battery. (a) What is the resistance of the bulb?\n(b) If the battery becomes weak and the voltage drops to 1.2 V, how would the\ncurrent change? Assume the bulb is approximately ohmic.\nAPPROACH We apply Ohm\'s law to the bulb, where the voltage applied across\nit is the battery voltage.\nSOLUTION (a) We change 300 mA to 0.30 A and use Eq. 18-2:\nR = Y = 1.5 V\n0.30 A\n= 5.00.\n(b) If the resistance stays the same, the current would be\n5.00\nI = X = 1.2 V\n=\n0.24 A = 240 mA,\nor a decrease of 60 mA.\nNOTE With the smaller current in part (b), the bulb filament\'s temperature would\nbe lower and the bulb less bright. Also, resistance does depend on temperature\n(Section 18-4), so our calculation is only a rough approximation.\nEXERCISE C What is the resistance of a lightbulb if 0.50 A flows through it when 120 V\nis connected across it?\nAll electric devices, from heaters to lightbulbs to stereo amplifiers, offer\nresistance to the flow of current. The filaments of lightbulbs (Fig. 18-5) and electric\nheaters are special types of wires whose resistance results in their becoming very\nhot. Generally, the connecting wires have very low resistance in comparison to the\nresistance of the wire filaments or coils, so the connecting wires usually have a\nminimal effect on the magnitude of the current.+\n+A useful analogy compares the flow of electric charge in a wire to the flow of water in a river, or in a\npipe, acted on by gravity. If the river (or pipe) is nearly level, the flow rate is small. But if one end is\nsomewhat higher than the other, the water flow rate-or current-is greater. The greater the differ-\nence in height, the swifter the current. We saw in Chapter 17 that electric potential is analogous to the\nheight of a cliff for gravity. Just as an increase in height can cause a greater flow of water, so a greater\nelectric potential difference, or voltage, causes a greater electric current. Resistance in a wire is analogous\nto rocks in a river that retard water flow.\n506 CHAPTER 18 Electric Currents\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'In many circuits, particularly in electronic devices, resistors are used to con-\ntrol the amount of current.

The values depend somewhat on purity, heat treatment, temper-\nature, and other factors. Notice that silver has the lowest resistivity and is thus\nthe best conductor (although it is expensive).

How\nlong a wire would have a 1.0- resistance?\nTemperature Dependence of Resistivity\nThe resistivity of a material depends somewhat on temperature. The resistance of\nmetals generally increases with temperature. This is not surprising, because at higher\ntemperatures, the atoms are moving more rapidly and are arranged in a less orderly\nfashion. So they might be expected to interfere more with the flow of electrons. If\nthe temperature change is not too great, the resistivity of metals usually increases\nnearly linearly with temperature. That is,\nPT = Po[1 + a(T-To)]\n(18-4)\nwhere po is the resistivity at some reference temperature To (such as 0℃ or 20℃),\nPr is the resistivity at a temperature T, and a is the temperature coefficient of\nresistivity. Values for a are given in Table 18-1. Note that the temperature coefficient\nfor semiconductors can be negative. Why? It seems that at higher temperatures,\nsome of the electrons that are normally not free in a semiconductor become free\nand can contribute to the current. Thus, the resistance of a semiconductor can\ndecrease with an increase in temperature.\nSECTION 18-4 Resistivity 509\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'PHYSICS APPLIED\nResistance thermometer\n10 mm.\n2\nFIGURE 18-15 A thermistor only\n13 mm long, shown next to a\nmillimeter ruler.\nFIGURE 18-16 Hot electric stove\nburner glows because of energy\ntransformed by electric current.\nEXAMPLE 18-7\nResistance thermometer.

(a) Less than 1% greater; (b) roughly 10% greater; (c) about\n2 times greater; (d) roughly 10 times greater; (e) more than 100 times greater.\nThe value of a in Eq. 18-4 can itself depend on temperature, so it is impor-\ntant to check the temperature range of validity of any value (say, in a handbook\nof physical data). If the temperature range is wide, Eq. 18-4 is not adequate and\nterms proportional to the square and cube of the temperature are needed, but\nthese terms are generally very small except when T - T0 is large.\n18-5 Electric Power\nElectric energy is useful to us because it can be easily transformed into other\nforms of energy. Motors transform electric energy into mechanical energy, and\nare examined in Chapter 20.\nIn other devices such as electric heaters, stoves, toasters, and hair dryers,\nelectric energy is transformed into thermal energy in a wire resistance known as a\n"heating element." And in an ordinary lightbulb, the tiny wire filament (Fig. 18-5\nand Chapter-Opening Photo) becomes so hot it glows; only a few percent of the\nenergy is transformed into visible light, and the rest, over 90%, into thermal energy.\nLightbulb filaments and heating elements (Fig. 18-16) in household appliances have\nresistances typically of a few ohms to a few hundred ohms.\nElectric energy is transformed into thermal energy or light in such devices,\nand there are many collisions between the moving electrons and the atoms of the\nwire. In each collision, part of the electron\'s kinetic energy is transferred to the\natom with which it collides. As a result, the kinetic energy of the wire\'s atoms\nincreases and hence the temperature (Section 13-9) of the wire element increases.\nThe increased thermal energy can be transferred as heat by conduction and\nconvection to the air in a heater or to food in a pan, by radiation to bread in a\ntoaster, or radiated as light.\n510 CHAPTER 18 Electric Currents\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': "To find the power transformed by an electric device, recall that the energy\ntransformed when a charge Q moves through a potential difference V is QV\n(Eq. 17-3).

Since power is the\nrate energy is transformed, the total energy used by any device is simply its power\nconsumption multiplied by the time it is on. If the power is in watts and the time is\nin seconds, the energy will be in joules since 1 W = 1 J/s.

One possi-\nble hazard is that the current-carrying wires in the wall of a building may become\nso hot as to start a fire. Thicker wires have less resistance (see Eq. 18-3) and thus\ncan carry more current without becoming too hot. When a wire carries more\ncurrent than is safe, it is said to be "overloaded." To prevent overloading, fuses or\ncircuit breakers are installed in circuits. They are basically switches (Fig. 18-19, top\nof next page) that open the circuit when the current exceeds a safe value.\nA 20-A fuse or circuit breaker, for example, opens when the current passing\nthrough it exceeds 20 A. If a circuit repeatedly burns out a fuse or opens a circuit\nbreaker, and no connected device requires more than 20 A, there are two possi-\nbilities: there may be too many devices drawing current in that circuit; or there is\na fault somewhere, such as a "short." A short, or "short circuit," means that two\nwires have touched that should not have (perhaps because the insulation has worn\nthrough) so the path of the current is shortened through a path of very low\nresistance. With reduced resistance, the current becomes very large and can\nmake a wire hot enough to start a fire. Short circuits should be remedied immediately.\n512 CHAPTER 18 Electric Currents\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Compressed\nspring\nContact\npoints\nContacts open\nOutside\nswitch\nMetal\nrod\nTo electric\ncircuit\nBimetallic\nstrip\nFuse\nribbon or\nfine wire\n(a) Types of fuses\n(b) Circuit breaker\n(closed)\n(c) Circuit breaker\n(open)\nHousehold circuits are designed with the various devices connected so that\neach receives the standard voltage (Fig. 18-20) from the electric company (usually\n120 V in the United States). Circuits with the devices arranged as in Fig. 18-20\nare called parallel circuits, as we will discuss in the next Chapter. When a fuse\nblows or circuit breaker opens, it is important to check the total current being\ndrawn on that circuit, which is the sum of the currents in each device.\nEXAMPLE 18-11\nWill a fuse blow? Determine the total current drawn by\nall the devices in the circuit of Fig. 18-20.\nAPPROACH Each device has the same 120-V voltage across it. The current each\ndraws from the source is found from I = P/V, Eq. 18-5.\nSOLUTION The circuit in Fig. 18-20 draws the following currents: the light-\nbulb draws I = P/V = 100 W/120 V = 0.8 A; the heater draws 1800 W/120 V =\n15.0 A; the power amplifier draws a maximum of 175 W/120 V = 1.5 A; and\nthe hair dryer draws 1500 W/120 V = 12.5 A. The total current drawn, if all\ndevices are used at the same time, is\n0.8 A + 15.0 A + 1.5 A + 12.5 A = 29.8 A.\nNOTE The heater draws as much current as 18 100-W lightbulbs. For safety, the\nheater should probably be on a circuit by itself.\nIf the circuit in Fig. 18-20 is designed for a 20-A fuse, the fuse should blow,\nand we hope it will, to prevent overloaded wires from getting hot enough to start\na fire. Something will have to be turned off to get this circuit below 20 A. (Houses\nand apartments usually have several circuits, each with its own fuse or circuit\nbreaker; try moving one of the devices to another circuit.) If the circuit is designed\nwith heavier wire and a 30-A fuse, the fuse shouldn\'t blow-if it does, a short may be\nthe problem. (The most likely place for a short is in the cord of one of the devices.)\nProper fuse size is selected according to the wire used to supply the current. A prop-\nerly rated fuse should never be replaced by a higher-rated one, even in a car.\nA fuse blowing or a circuit breaker opening is acting like a switch, making an\n"open circuit." By an open circuit, we mean that there is no longer a complete\nconducting path, so no current can flow; it is as if R = 00.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 18-12\nA dangerous extension cord.

This is called a direct current, or dc. Electric generators at electric power\nplants, however, produce alternating current, or ac. (Sometimes capital letters are\nused, DC and AC.) An alternating current reverses direction many times per second\nand is commonly sinusoidal, Fig. 18-21. The electrons in a wire first move in one\ndirection and then in the other. The current supplied to homes and businesses by\nelectric companies is ac throughout virtually the entire world. We will discuss and\nanalyze ac circuits in detail in Chapter 21. But because ac circuits are so common\nin real life, we will discuss some of their basic aspects here.\nt\nCurrent\n(a) dc\nVA\nThe voltage produced by an ac electric generator is sinusoidal, as we shall see\nlater. The current it produces is thus sinusoidal (Fig. 18-21b). We can write the\nvoltage as a function of time as\nt\n-10\n(b) ac\nFIGURE 18-21 (a) Direct current,\nand (b) alternating current, as\nfunctions of time.\nFIGURE 18-22 Power transformed\nin a resistor in an ac circuit.\nIZR\nPower\nPOR FIR\nt\nTime\nV = Vo sin 2mft = Vo sin ot.\n(18-7a)\nThe potential V oscillates between +Vo and -Vo, and Vo is referred to as the peak\nvoltage. The frequency fis the number of complete oscillations made per second,\nand @ = 2mf. In most areas of the United States and Canada, f is 60 Hz (the\nunit "hertz," as we saw in Chapters 8 and 11, means cycles per second). In many\ncountries, 50 Hz is used.\nEquation 18-2, V = IR, works also for ac: if a voltage V exists across a resis-\ntance R, then the current I through the resistance is\nI = = o sin ot = 10 sin ot.\n(18-7b)\nThe quantity Io = Vo/ R is the peak current. The current is considered posi-\ntive when the electrons flow in one direction and negative when they flow in the\nopposite direction. It is clear from Fig. 18-21b that an alternating current is as\noften positive as it is negative. Thus, the average current is zero. This does not\nmean, however, that no power is needed or that no heat is produced in a resistor.\nElectrons do move back and forth, and do produce heat. Indeed, the power\ntransformed in a resistance R at any instant is (Eq. 18-7b)\nP = 12R = 12 Rsin2 @t.\nBecause the current is squared, we see that the power is always positive, as\ngraphed in Fig. 18-22. The quantity sin2 ot varies between 0 and 1; and it is not\ntoo difficult to showt that its average value is 2, as indicated in Fig. 18-22. Thus,\nthe average power transformed, P, is\nP = 112R.\nSince power can also be written P = V2/R = (V2/R) sin2 ot, we also have that\nthe average power is\nP = 1 VE.\nR\nThe average or mean value of the square of the current or voltage is thus what\nis important for calculating average power: 12 = {12 and V2 = {v2. The square\nroot of each of these is the rms (root-mean-square) value of the current or voltage:\nIrms = VP = -\nI0\nv2\n(18-8a)\nVrms = VV2 =\nV0\nV/2\n= 0.707 I0,\n= 0.707Vo -\n(18-8b)\n+A graph of cos2 ot versus t is identical to that for sin2 ot in Fig. 18-22, except that the points are shifted\n(by ¿ cycle) on the time axis. Thus the average value of sin2 and cos2, averaged over one or more full cycles,\nwill be the same. From the trigonometric identity sin2 0 + cos2 0 = 1, we can write\n(sin2 wt) + (cos2 wt) = 2(sin2 wt) = 1.\nHence the average value of sin2 ot is 2 .\n514 CHAPTER 18 Electric Currents\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': "The rms values of V and I are sometimes called the effective values.

Hence it is usually the rms\nvalue of current and voltage that is specified or measured. For example, in the\nUnited States and Canada, standard line voltage is 120-V ac. The 120 V is Vrms ;\nthe peak voltage Vo is (Eq. 18-8b)\nVo= V2Vrms = 170 V.\nIn much of the world (Europe, Australia, Asia) the rms voltage is 240 V, so the\npeak voltage is 340 V.

In a conducting wire, for example, we can imagine the\nfree electrons as moving about randomly at high speeds, bouncing off the atoms of\nthe wire (somewhat like the molecules of a gas-Sections 13-8 to 13-10). When\nan electric field exists in the wire, Fig. 18-24, the electrons feel a force and initially\nbegin to accelerate. But they soon reach a more or less steady average velocity\nknown as their drift velocity, va (collisions with atoms in the wire keep them from\naccelerating further). The drift velocity is normally very much smaller than the\nelectrons\' average random speed.\nWe can relate va to the macroscopic current I in the wire. In a time At, the\nelectrons will travel a distance ( = va At on average. Suppose the wire has cross-\nsectional area A. Then in time At, electrons in a volume V = Al = Ava At will\npass through the cross section A of wire, as shown in Fig. 18-25. If there\nare n free electrons (each with magnitude of charge e) per unit volume, then the\ntotal number of electrons is N = nV (V is volume, not voltage) and the total\ncharge AQ that passes through the area A in a time At is\nAQ = (number of charges, N) X (charge per particle)\n= (nV)(e) = (nAva At)(e).\nThe magnitude of the current I in the wire is thus\nI = A = ne AVd .\n(18-10)\nEXAMPLE 18-14\nElectron speed in wire. A copper wire 3.2 mm in diameter\ncarries a 5.0-A current. Determine the drift velocity of the free electrons. Assume\nthat one electron per Cu atom is free to move (the others remain bound to the atom).\nAPPROACH We apply Eq. 18-10 to find the drift velocity va if we can determine\nthe number n of free electrons per unit volume. Since we assume there is one\nfree electron per atom, the density of free electrons, n, is the same as the number\nof Cu atoms per unit volume. The atomic mass of Cu is 63.5 u (see Periodic Table\ninside the back cover), so 63.5 g of Cu contains one mole or 6.02 × 1023 free\nelectrons. To find the volume V of this amount of copper, and then n = N/V,\nwe use the mass density of copper (Table 10-1), pp = 8.9 × 103 kg/m3, where\nPD = m/V. (We use pp to distinguish it here from p for resistivity.)\nSOLUTION The number of free electrons per unit volume, n = N/V (where\nV = volume = m/pp), is\nn = 4\nm/PD\nN\nN (1 mole)\n=\nN\n=\nm(1 mole)\nPD\n1\n6.02 × 1023 electrons\nn =\n(8.9 × 103 kg/m3) = 8.4 × 1028 m-3.\n63.5 × 10-3 kg\nThe cross-sectional area of the wire is A = Tr2 = TT(1.6 × 10-3 m)2 =\n8.0 × 10-6 m2. Then, by Eq. 18-10, the drift velocity has magnitude\nI\n5.0 A\nVd =\nne A\n= 4.6×10-5m/s ~0.05mm/s.\n=\n(8.4×1028 m-3)(1.6×10-19C)(8.0×10-6m2)\nNOTE The actual speed of electrons bouncing around inside the metal is estimated\nto be about 1.6 × 106 m/s at 20°C, very much greater than the drift velocity.\nThe drift velocity of electrons in a wire is slow, only about 0.05 mm/s in\nExample 18-14, which means it takes an electron about 20 × 103 s, or 52 h, to\ntravel only 1 m. This is not how fast "electricity travels": when you flip a light\nswitch, the light-even if many meters away-goes on nearly instantaneously.\nWhy? Because electric fields travel essentially at the speed of light (3 × 108 m/s).\nWe can think of electrons in a wire as being like a pipe full of water: when a little\nwater enters one end of the pipe, some water immediately comes out the other end.\n516 CHAPTER 18\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': '*\n18-9 Superconductivity\nAt very low temperatures, well below 0℃, the resistivity (Section 18-4) of certain\nmetals and certain compounds or alloys becomes zero as measured by the highest-\nprecision techniques. Materials in such a state are said to be superconducting.\nThis phenomenon was first observed by H. K. Onnes (1853-1926) in 1911 when he\ncooled mercury below 4.2 K (-269℃) and found that the resistance of mercury\nsuddenly dropped to zero. In general, superconductors become superconducting\nonly below a certain transition temperature or critical temperature, Tc, which is\nusually within a few degrees of absolute zero. Current in a ring-shaped supercon-\nducting material has been observed to flow for years in the absence of a potential\ndifference, with no measurable decrease. Measurements show that the resistivity p\nof superconductors is less than 4 × 10-25 Q2 .m, which is over 1016 times smaller\nthan that for copper, and is considered to be zero in practice. See Fig. 18-26.\nResistivity, p\nFIGURE 18-26 A superconducting\nmaterial has zero resistivity when its\ntemperature is below Tc, its "critical\ntemperature." At temperatures above Tc,\nthe resistivity jumps to a "normal" nonzero\nvalue and increases with temperature as\nmost materials do (Eq. 18-4).\nT\nTC\nBefore 1986 the highest temperature at which a material was found to\nsuperconduct was 23 K, which required liquid helium to keep the material cold.\nIn 1987, a compound of yttrium, barium, copper, and oxygen (YBCO) was\ndeveloped that can be superconducting at 90 K. Since this is above the boiling\ntemperature of liquid nitrogen, 77 K, liquid nitrogen is sufficiently cold to keep\nthe material superconducting. This was an important breakthrough because\nliquid nitrogen is much more easily and cheaply obtained than is the liquid\nhelium needed for earlier superconductors. Superconductivity at temperatures\nas high as 160 K has been reported, though in fragile compounds.\nTo develop high-Tc superconductors for use as wires (such as for wires in\n"superconducting electromagnets"-Section 20-7), many applications today\nutilize a bismuth-strontium-calcium-copper oxide (BSCCO). A major challenge\nis how to make a useable, bendable wire out of the BSCCO, which is very brittle.\n(One solution is to embed tiny filaments of the high-Tc superconductor in a metal\nalloy, which is not resistanceless but has resistance much less than a conventional\ncopper cable.)\nFIGURE 18-27 A simplified sketch\nof a typical neuron.\nSignal from another neuron\n*\n18-10 Electrical Conduction in the\nHuman Nervous System\nAn interesting example of the flow of electric charge is in the human nervous system,\nwhich provides us with the means for being aware of the world, for communication\nwithin the body, and for controlling the body\'s muscles. Although the detailed\nfunctioning of the hugely complex nervous system still is not well understood,\nwe do have a reasonable understanding of how messages are transmitted within\nthe nervous system: they are electrical signals passing along the basic element\nof the nervous system, the neuron.\nNeurons are living cells of unusual shape (Fig. 18-27). Attached to the main\ncell body are several small appendages known as dendrites and a long tail called\nthe axon. Signals are received by the dendrites and are propagated along the\naxon. When a signal reaches the nerve endings, it is transmitted to the next\nneuron or to a muscle at a connection called a synapse.\nNucleus\nSynapse\nDendrites\nCell body\nAxon\nMyelin sheath\nNode of Ranvier\nSynapse\nNerve endings\nAnother neuron\nor a muscle\n*SECTION 18-10 Electrical Conduction in the Human Nervous System 517\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'TABLE 18-2\nConcentrations of Ions Inside\nand Outside a Typical Axon\nConcentration Concentration\ninside axon\n(mol/m3)\noutside axon\n(mol/m3)\nK+\n140\n5\nNa+\n15\n140\nCI\n9\n125\nNa+\nExtracellular\nfluid\nCl-\n+\n+\n–\nK+\nAxon\n–\nMembrane\n-\n–\n+\n+\n+\nFIGURE 18-28 How a dipole layer\nof charge forms on a cell membrane.\nFIGURE 18-29 Measuring the\npotential difference between the\ninside and outside of a nerve cell.\noutside\nAxon\nVinside\nFIGURE 18-30 Action potential.\n40 +\n20\n+\nTime (ms)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nPotential V (mV)\n-20\n-40\n-60\n-80\nResting\npotential\nAction\npotential\nA neuron, before transmitting an electrical signal, is in the so-called "resting\nstate." Like nearly all living cells, neurons have a net positive charge on the outer\nsurface of the cell membrane and a negative charge on the inner surface.\nThis difference in charge, or dipole layer, means that a potential difference\nexists across the cell membrane. When a neuron is not transmitting a signal, this\nresting potential, normally stated as\nVinside - Voutside ,\nis typically -60 mV to -90 mV, depending on the type of organism. The most\ncommon ions in a cell are K+, Na+, and Cl . There are large differences in the\nconcentrations of these ions inside and outside an axon, as indicated by the typical\nvalues given in Table 18-2. Other ions are also present, so the fluids both inside\nand outside the axon are electrically neutral. Because of the differences in concentra-\ntion, there is a tendency for ions to diffuse across the membrane (see Section 13-13\non diffusion). However, in the resting state the cell membrane prevents any net\nflow of Na+ through a mechanism of active transport of Na+ ions out of the cell\nby a particular protein to which Na+ attach; energy needed comes from ATP.\nBut it does allow the flow of Cl" ions, and less so of K+ ions, and it is these two\nions that produce the dipole charge layer on the membrane. Because there is\na greater concentration of K+ inside the cell than outside, more K+ ions tend\nto diffuse outward across the membrane than diffuse inward. A K+ ion that\npasses through the membrane becomes attached to the outer surface of the\nmembrane, and leaves behind an equal negative charge that lies on the inner\nsurface of the membrane (Fig. 18-28). The fluids themselves remain neutral.\nWhat keeps the ions on the membrane is their attraction for each other across\nthe membrane. Independently, Cl" ions tend to diffuse into the cell since their\nconcentration outside is higher. Both K+ and Cl" diffusion tends to charge the\ninterior surface of the membrane negative and the outside positive. As charge\naccumulates on the membrane surface, it becomes increasingly difficult for more\nions to diffuse: K+ ions trying to move outward, for example, are repelled by the\npositive charge already there. Equilibrium is reached when the tendency to diffuse\nbecause of the concentration difference is just balanced by the electrical potential\ndifference across the membrane. The greater the concentration difference, the\ngreater the potential difference across the membrane (-60 mV to -90 mV).\nThe most important aspect of a neuron is not that it has a resting potential\n(most cells do), but rather that it can respond to a stimulus and conduct an elec-\ntrical signal along its length. The stimulus could be thermal (when you touch a\nhot stove) or chemical (as in taste buds); it could be pressure (as on the skin or at\nthe eardrum), or light (as in the eye); or it could be the electric stimulus of a\nsignal coming from the brain or another neuron. In the laboratory, the stimulus is\nusually electrical and is applied by a tiny probe at some point on the neuron. If\nthe stimulus exceeds some threshold, a voltage pulse will travel down the axon.\nThis voltage pulse can be detected at a point on the axon using a voltmeter or an\noscilloscope connected as in Fig. 18-29. This voltage pulse has the shape shown\nin Fig. 18-30, and is called an action potential. As can be seen, the potential\nincreases from a resting potential of about -70 mV and becomes a positive\n30 mV or 40 mV. The action potential lasts for about 1 ms and travels down an\naxon with a speed of 30 m/s to 150 m/s. When an action potential is stimulated,\nthe nerve is said to have "fired."\nWhat causes the action potential? At the point where the stimulus occurs, the\nmembrane suddenly alters its permeability, becoming much more permeable to\nNa+ than to K+ and Cl" ions. Thus, Na+ ions rush into the cell and the inner surface\nof the wall becomes positively charged, and the potential difference quickly swings\npositive (~ +30 mV in Fig. 18-30). Just as suddenly, the membrane returns to\nits original characteristics; it becomes impermeable to Na+ and in fact pumps out\nNa+ ions. The diffusion of Cl" and K+ ions again predominates and the original\nresting potential is restored (-70 mV in Fig. 18-30).\n*This transport mechanism is sometimes referred to as the "sodium pump."\n518 CHAPTER 18 Electric Currents\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A If 1 million electrons per second pass a point in a wire, what is the current?'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'What causes the action potential to travel along the axon? The action potential\noccurs at the point of stimulation, as shown in Fig. 18-31a. The membrane momen-\ntarily is positive on the inside and negative on the outside at this point. Nearby\ncharges are attracted toward this region, as shown in Fig. 18-31b. The potential\nin these adjacent regions then drops, causing an action potential there. Thus, as\nthe membrane returns to normal at the original point, nearby it experiences an\naction potential, so the action potential moves down the axon (Figs. 18-31c and d).\nYou may wonder if the number of ions that pass through the membrane would\nsignificantly alter the concentrations. The answer is no; and we can show why (and\nagain show the power and usefulness of physics) by treating the axon as a capacitor\nas we do in Search and Learn Problem 6 (the concentration changes by less than\n1 part in 104).\nSummary\nAn electric battery serves as a source of nearly constant poten-\ntial difference by transforming chemical energy into electric\nenergy. A simple battery consists of two electrodes made of\ndifferent metals immersed in a solution or paste known as an\nelectrolyte.\nElectric current, I, refers to the rate of flow of electric\ncharge and is measured in amperes (A): 1 A equals a flow of\n1 C/s past a given point.\nThe direction of conventional current is that of positive\ncharge flow. In a wire, it is actually negatively charged elec-\ntrons that move, so they flow in a direction opposite to the\nconventional current. A positive charge flow in one direction is\nalmost always equivalent to a negative charge flow in the\nopposite direction. Positive conventional current always flows\nfrom a high potential to a low potential.\nThe resistance R of a device is defined by the relation\nV = IR,\n(18-2)\nwhere I is the current in the device when a potential difference V\nis applied across it. For materials such as metals, R is a constant\nindependent of V (thus I « V), a result known as Ohm\'s law.\nThus, the current I coming from a battery of voltage V depends\non the resistance R of the circuit connected to it.\nVoltage is applied across a device or between the ends of a\nwire. Current passes through a wire or device. Resistance is a\nproperty of the wire or device.\nThe unit of resistance is the ohm (2), where 1 0 = 1 V/A.\nSee Table 18-3.\nTABLE 18-3 Summary of Units\nCurrent\n1A = 1 C/s\nPotential difference\n1V = 1J/C\nPower\n1W = 1 J/s\nResistance\n10 = 1V/A\nThe resistance R of a wire is inversely proportional to its\ncross-sectional area A, and directly proportional to its length l\nand to a property of the material called its resistivity:\nR = pl.\n(18-3)\nThe resistivity, p, increases with temperature for metals, but for\nsemiconductors it may decrease.\nThe rate at which energy is transformed in a resistance R\nfrom electric to other forms of energy (such as heat and light)\nPoint of stimulation\nExterior\nMembrane\n+ -- ++++++++++\n- + + -\n(a)\nInterior\n+\n–\n–\n+++++ + + +\n(b)\n+ 2+ +\n+ + + + +\n+ -\n+\n(c)\n+ + +\n+\n1\n+\n+ + +\n–\n–\n–\n–\n(d)\nAction potential moving right\nFIGURE 18-31 Propagation of action\npotential along axon membrane.\nis equal to the product of current and voltage.

In SI units, energy is given in joules (1 J = 1 W ·s),\nbut electric companies use a larger unit, the kilowatt-hour\n(1 kWh = 3.6× 106 J).\nElectric current can be direct current (de), in which the\ncurrent is steady in one direction; or it can be alternating\ncurrent (ac), in which the current reverses direction at a particular\nfrequency f, typically 60 Hz. Alternating currents are typically\nsinusoidal in time,\nI = Io sin ot,\n(18-7b)\nwhere @ = 2mf, and are produced by an alternating voltage.\nThe rms values of sinusoidally alternating currents and\nvoltages are given by\nIrms = -\nI0\nand Vrms =\nV0\n,\n(18-8)\nV2\nV2\nrespectively, where I0 and V0 are the peak values.
