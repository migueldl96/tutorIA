How do we see? What is the some-\nthing called light that enters our eyes and causes the sensation of sight?\nHow does light behave so that we can see everything that we do? We saw in\nChapter 22 that light can be considered a form of electromagnetic radiation. We\nnow examine the subject of light in detail in the next three Chapters.\nWe see an object in one of two ways: (1) the object may be a source of light,\nsuch as a lightbulb, a flame, or a star, in which case we see the light emitted directly\nfrom the source; or, more commonly, (2) we see an object by light reflected from it.\n", 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'In the latter case, the light may have originated from the Sun, artificial lights,\nor a campfire. An understanding of how objects emit light was not achieved until\nthe 1920s, and will be discussed in Chapter 27. How light is reflected from objects\nwas understood much earlier, and will be discussed in Section 23-2.\n23-1 The Ray Model of Light\nA great deal of evidence suggests that light travels in straight lines under a wide vari-\nety of circumstances .* For example, a source of light like the Sun (which at its great\ndistance from us is nearly a "point source") casts distinct shadows, and the beam from\na laser pointer appears to be a straight line. In fact, we infer the positions of objects\nin our environment by assuming that light moves from the object to our eyes in\nstraight-line paths. Our orientation to the physical world is based on this assumption.\nThis reasonable assumption is the basis of the ray model of light. This model\nassumes that light travels in straight-line paths called light rays. Actually, a ray is\nan idealization; it is meant to represent an extremely narrow beam of light. When\nwe see an object, according to the ray model, light reaches our eyes from each point\non the object. Although light rays leave each point in many different directions,\nnormally only a small bundle of these rays can enter the pupil of an observer\'s\neye, as shown in Fig. 23-1. If the person\'s head moves to one side, a different\nbundle of rays will enter the eye from each point.\nWe saw in Chapter 22 that light can be considered as an electromagnetic wave.\nAlthough the ray model of light does not deal with this aspect of light (we discuss\nthe wave nature of light in Chapter 24), the ray model has been very successful\nin describing many aspects of light such as reflection, refraction, and the formation\nof images by mirrors and lenses. Because these explanations involve straight-line\nrays at various angles, this subject is referred to as geometric optics.\n23-2 Reflection; Image Formation\nby a Plane Mirror\nWhen light strikes the surface of an object, some of the light is reflected. The rest\ncan be absorbed by the object (and transformed to thermal energy) or, if the object\nis transparent like glass or water, part can be transmitted through. For a very\nsmooth shiny object such as a silvered mirror, over 95% of the light may be reflected.\nNormal\nto surface\n1\nNormal\nto surface\nSource\nAngle of i Angle of\nincidence | reflection\nIncident\nlight ray\nReflected\nlight ray\nAngle of i Angle of\nincidence ! reflection\nLight ray\n0;\nThis bundle\nenters the eye\nFIGURE 23-1 Light rays come from\neach single point on an object.

It is found that the incident and reflected rays\nlie in the same plane with the normal to the surface, and that\nthe angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, 0r = 0; .\nLAW OF REFLECTION\nThis is the law of reflection, and it is depicted in Fig. 23-2. It was known to the\nancient Greeks, and you can confirm it yourself by shining a narrow flashlight\nbeam or a laser pointer at a mirror in a darkened room.\n+In a uniform transparent medium such as air or glass: But not always, such as for nonuniform air\nthat allows optical illusions and mirages which we discuss in Section 24-2 (Fig. 24-4).\nSECTION 23-2 Reflection; Image Formation by a Plane Mirror 645\n', 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 23-3 Diffuse reflection\nfrom a rough surface.\nSource\nWhen light is incident upon a rough surface, even microscopically rough such\nas this page, it is reflected in many directions, as shown in Fig. 23-3. This is called\ndiffuse reflection. The law of reflection still holds, however, at each small section\nof the surface. Because of diffuse reflection in all directions, an ordinary object\ncan be seen at many different angles by the light reflected from it. When you move\nyour head to the side, different reflected rays reach your eye from each point\non the object (such as this page), Fig. 23-4a. Let us compare diffuse reflection to\nreflection from a mirror, which is known as specular reflection. ("Speculum" is\nLatin for mirror.) When a narrow beam of light shines on a mirror, the light\nwill not reach your eye unless your eye is positioned at just the right place where\nthe law of reflection is satisfied, as shown in Fig. 23-4b.

Using the fact that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is\nalways 180°, and noting that the two normals to the two mirrors are perpendicular\nto each other, we have 02 + 03 + 90° = 180°. Thus 03 = 180° - 90° - 75° = 15°.\nBy the law of reflection, 04 = 03 = 15°, so 05 = 75° is the angle the reflected\nray makes with the second mirror surface.\nNOTE The outgoing ray is parallel to the incoming ray.

Also, you don't see yourself as others see you, because left and right appear\nreversed in the image.\nA plane mirror is one with a smooth flat reflecting surface. Figure 23-7 shows\nhow an image is formed by a plane mirror according to the ray model. We are\nviewing the mirror, on edge, in the diagram of Fig. 23-7, and the rays are shown\nreflecting from the front surface. (Good mirrors are generally made by putting a\nhighly reflective metallic coating on one surface of a very flat piece of glass.) Rays\nfrom two different points on an object (the bottle on the left in Fig. 23-7) are\nshown: two rays are shown leaving from a point on the top of the bottle, and two\nmore from a point on the bottom.

We use geometry now, for the\nrays at B. The angles ADB and CDB are right angles; and because of the law of\nreflection, 0; = Or at point B. Therefore, by geometry, angles ABD and CBD are\nalso equal. The two triangles ABD and CBD are thus congruent, and the length\nAD = CD. That is, the image appears as far behind the mirror as the object is\nin front. The image distance, di (perpendicular distance from mirror to image,\nFig. 23-7), equals the object distance, do (perpendicular distance from object to mir-\nror). From the geometry, we also can see that the height of the image is the same\nas that of the object.\nThe light rays do not actually pass through the image location itself in Fig. 23-7.\n(Note where the red lines are dashed to show they are our projections, not rays.)\nThe image would not appear on paper or film placed at the location of the image.\nTherefore, it is called a virtual image. This is to distinguish it from a real image\nin which the light does pass through the image and which therefore could appear\non a white surface, or on film or on an electronic sensor placed at the image position.\nOur eyes can see both real and virtual images, as long as the diverging rays enter\nour pupils. We will see that curved mirrors and lenses can form real images, as well\nas virtual.

A woman 1.60 m\ntall stands in front of a vertical plane mirror. What is the minimum height of the\nmirror, and how high must its lower edge be above the floor, if she is to be able\nto see her whole body? Assume that her eyes are 10 cm below the top of her\nhead.\nAPPROACH For her to see her whole body, light rays from the top of her head\n(point G) and from the bottom of her foot (A) must reflect from the mirror and\nenter her eye, Fig. 23-8. We don't show two rays diverging from each point as we\ndid in Fig. 23-7, where we wanted to find where the image is. Now that we know\nthe image is the same distance behind a plane mirror as the object is in front, we\nonly need to show one ray leaving point G (top of head) and one ray leaving\npoint A (her toe), and then use geometry.\nSOLUTION First consider the ray that leaves her foot at A, reflects at B, and\nenters the eye at E. The mirror needs to extend no lower than B. The angle of\nreflection equals the angle of incidence, so the height BD is half of the height AE.\nBecause AE = 1.60 m - 0.10 m = 1.50 m, then BD = 0.75 m. Similarly, if the\nwoman is to see the top of her head, the top edge of the mirror only needs to\nreach point F, which is 5 cm below the top of her head (half of GE = 10 cm).\nThus, DF = 1.55 m, and the mirror needs to have a vertical height of only\n(1.55 m - 0.75 m) = 0.80 m. And the mirror's bottom edge must be 0.75 m\nabove the floor.\nNOTE We see that a mirror, if positioned at the correct height (as in Fig. 23-8),\nneed be only half as tall as a person for that person to be able to see all of himself\nor herself.\nEXERCISE A Does the result of Example 23-2 depend on your distance from the mir-\nror?

Figure 23-9 is drawn\nassuming the photo is upside down. In this case, the Sun blocked by the tree\nwould be the direct view, and the full view of the Sun the reflection: the ray which\nreflects off the water and into the camera travels at an angle below the branch,\nwhereas the ray that travels directly to the camera passes through the branches.\nThis works. Try to draw a diagram assuming the photo is right side up (thus assum-\ning that the image of the Sun in the reflection is higher above the horizon than\nit is as viewed directly). It won\'t work.

A spherical mirror is called convex if the reflection takes place\non the outer surface of the spherical shape so that the center of the mirror surface\nbulges out toward the viewer, Fig. 23-10a. A mirror is called concave if the reflecting\nsurface is on the inner surface of the sphere so that the mirror surface curves away\nfrom the viewer (like a "cave"), Fig. 23-10b. Concave mirrors are used as shaving\nor cosmetic mirrors (magnifying mirrors), Fig. 23-11a, because they magnify.\nConvex mirrors are sometimes used on cars and trucks (rearview mirrors) and in\nshops (to watch for theft), because they take in a wide field of view, Fig. 23-11b.\nSoftware\nAmazing\n22\nNormal\nto surface\nr/\ni\nRays\nfrom\ndistant\nsource\nConvex\nmirror\n(a)\nNormal\nθ\ni\nθ\nto surface\nr\nConcave\nmirror\n(b)\nFIGURE 23-10 Mirrors with convex\nand concave spherical surfaces.

Note the extreme\ndistortion-this mirror has a large curved\nsurface and does not fit the "paraxial ray"\napproximation discussed on the next page.\n(a)\n(b)\nFocal Point and Focal Length\nTo see how spherical mirrors form images, we first consider an object that is very\nfar from a concave mirror. For a distant object, as shown in Fig. 23-12, the rays\nfrom each point on the object that strike the mirror will be nearly parallel. For an object\ninfinitely far away (the Sun and stars approach this), the rays would be precisely parallel.\nMirror\n6\nFIGURE 23-12 If the object\'s distance is large compared to the size of the mirror\n(or lens), the rays arrive nearly parallel. They are parallel for an object at infinity (co).\nThese rays strike the\nmirror, and they are\nessentially parallel.\nSECTION 23-3 649\n', 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'FIGURE 23-13 Parallel rays\nstriking a concave spherical mirror do\nnot intersect (or focus) at precisely a\nsingle point. (This "defect" is referred\nto as "spherical aberration.")\nNow consider such parallel rays falling on a concave mirror as in Fig. 23-13.\nThe law of reflection holds for each of these rays at the point each strikes the\nmirror. As can be seen, they are not all brought to a single point. In order to form\na sharp image, the rays must come to a point. Thus a spherical mirror will not\nmake as sharp an image as a plane mirror will. However, as we show below,\nif the mirror is small compared to its radius of curvature, so that a reflected ray\nmakes only a small angle with the incident ray (20 in Fig. 23-14), then the rays\nwill cross each other at very nearly a single point, or focus. In the case shown in\nFig. 23-14, the incoming rays are parallel to the principal axis, which is defined\nas the straight line perpendicular to the curved surface at its center (line CA in\nFig. 23-14). The point F, where incident parallel rays come to a focus after reflec-\ntion, is called the focal point of the mirror. The distance between F and the center\nof the mirror, length FA, is called the focal length, f, of the mirror. The focal\npoint is also the image point for an object infinitely far away along the principal\naxis. The image of the Sun, for example, would be at F.\nFIGURE 23-14 Rays parallel to the principal\naxis of a concave spherical mirror come to a\nfocus at F, the focal point, as long as the mirror\nis small in width as compared to its radius of\ncurvature, r, so that the rays are "paraxial"-\nthat is, make only small angles with the\nhorizontal axis.\nB\nr\nθ\nA\nC\nF\n1-\nPrincipal\naxis\n·f\nr\nNow we will show, for a mirror whose reflecting surface is small compared to\nits radius of curvature, that the rays very nearly meet at a common point, F, and\nwe will also determine the focal length f. In this approximation, we consider only\nrays that make a small angle with the principal axis; such rays are called paraxial\nrays, and their angles are exaggerated in Fig. 23-14 to make the labels clear. First\nwe consider a ray that strikes the mirror at B in Fig. 23-14. The point C is the\ncenter of curvature of the mirror (the center of the sphere of which the mirror is\na part). So the dashed line CB is equal to r, the radius of curvature, and CB is\nnormal to the mirror\'s surface at B. The incoming ray that hits the mirror at B\nmakes an angle 0 with this normal, and hence the reflected ray, BF, also makes an\nangle 0 with the normal (law of reflection). The angle BCF is also 0, as shown.\nThe triangle CBF is isosceles because two of its angles are equal. Thus length\nCF = FB. We assume the mirror surface is small compared to the mirror\'s radius\nof curvature, so the angles are small, and the length FB is nearly equal to\nlength FA. In this approximation, FA = FC. But FA = f, the focal length,\nand CA = 2×FA = r. Thus the focal length is half the radius of curvature:\nf = 2.\n[spherical mirror] (23-1)\nWe assumed only that the angle 0 was small, so this result applies for all other\nincident paraxial rays. Thus all paraxial rays pass through the same point F, the\nfocal point.\nSince it is only approximately true that the rays come to a perfect focus at F,\nthe more curved the mirror, the worse the approximation (Fig. 23-13) and the more\nblurred the image. This "defect" of spherical mirrors is called spherical aberration;\nwe will discuss it more with regard to lenses in Chapter 25. A parabolic reflector,\non the other hand, will reflect the rays to a perfect focus. However, because para-\nbolic shapes are much harder to make and thus much more expensive, spherical\nmirrors are used for most purposes. (Many astronomical telescopes use parabolic\nreflectors, as do TV satellite dish antennas which concentrate radio waves to\nnearly a point, Fig. 22-19.) We consider here only spherical mirrors and we will\nassume that they are small compared to their radius of curvature so that the\nimage is sharp and Eq. 23-1 holds.\n650 CHAPTER 23 Light: Geometric Optics\n', 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Image Formation-Ray Diagrams\nWe saw that for an object at infinity, the image is located at the focal point of a\nconcave spherical mirror, where f = r/2.

[Note that our mirror is not\nsmall compared to f, so our diagram\nwill not give the precise position of\nthe image.]\nA\nMany rays could be drawn leaving any point on an object, but determining the image\nposition is faster if we deal with three particular rays. These are the rays labeled\n1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 23-15 and we draw them leaving object point O' as follows:\nRay 1 leaving O' is drawn parallel to the axis; therefore after reflection it must\npass along a line through F, Fig. 23-15a (just as parallel rays did in Fig. 23-14).\nRay 2 leaves O' and is made to pass through F (Fig. 23-15b); therefore it must\nreflect so it is parallel to the axis. (In reverse, a parallel ray passes through F.)\nRay 3 is drawn along a radius of the spherical surface (Fig. 23-15c) and is\nperpendicular to the mirror, so it is reflected back on itself and passes\nthrough C, the center of curvature.\nAll three rays leave a single point O' on the object. After reflection from a (small)\nmirror, the point at which these rays cross is the image point I'. All other rays\nfrom the same object point will also pass through this image point. To find the\nimage point for any object point, only these three types of rays need to be drawn.\nOnly two of these rays are needed, but the third serves as a check.\nWe have shown the image point in Fig. 23-15 only for a single point on the\nobject. Other points on the object are imaged nearby. For instance, the bottom of\nthe arrow, on the principal axis at point O, is imaged on the axis at point I. So a\ncomplete image of the object is formed (dashed arrow in Fig. 23-15c). Because the\nlight actually passes through the image, this is a real image that will appear on a\nwhite surface or film placed there. This can be compared to the virtual image\nformed by a plane mirror (the light does not pass through that image, Fig. 23-7).\nThe image in Fig. 23-15 can be seen by the eye only when the eye is placed to\nthe left of the image, so that some of the rays diverging from each point on the image\n(as point I') can enter the eye as shown in Fig. 23-15c (just as in Figs. 23-1 and 23-7).\nRAY DIAGRAM\nFinding the image position\nfor a curved mirror\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nImage point is where\nreflected rays intersect\nSECTION 23-3 651\n", 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Mirror Equation and Magnification\nImage points can be determined, roughly, by drawing the three rays as just described,\nFig. 23-15.

A 1.50-cm-high object is\nplaced 20.0 cm from a concave mirror with radius of curvature 30.0 cm. Deter-\nmine (a) the position of the image, and (b) its size.\nAPPROACH We determine the focal length from the radius of curvature\n(Eq. 23-1), f = r/2 = 15.0cm. The ray diagram is basically the same as\nFig. 23-16, since the object is between F and C. The position and size of the\nimage are found from Eqs. 23-2 and 23-3.\nSOLUTION Referring to Fig. 23-16, we have CA = r = 30.0 cm, FA = f =\n15.0 cm, and OA = do = 20.0 cm.\n(a) We start with the mirror equation, Eq. 23-2, rearranging it (subtracting (1/do)\nfrom both sides):\n1\n1\n=\n1\n-\n=\n1\ndi\nf\ndo\n15.0 cm\n1\n20.0 cm\n=\n0.0167 cm-1.\nSo di = 1/(0.0167 cm-1) = 60.0 cm. Because di is positive, the image is 60.0 cm\nin front of the mirror, on the same side as the object.\n(b) From Eq. 23-3, the magnification is\nm = - di = _ 60.0 cm\n20.0 cm\n-3.00.\nThe image is 3.0 times larger than the object, and its height is\nhi = mho = (-3.00)(1.5 cm) = - 4.5 cm.\nThe minus sign reminds us that the image is inverted, as shown in Fig. 23-16.\nNOTE When an object is further from a concave mirror than the focal point, we\ncan see from Fig. 23-15 or 23-16 that the image is always inverted and real.\nCAUTION\nRemember to take the reciprocal\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 23-5\nReversible rays. If the object in Example 23-4\nis placed instead where the image is (see Fig. 23-16), where will the new image be?\nRESPONSE The mirror equation is symmetric in do and di . Thus the new image\nwill be where the old object was. Indeed, in Fig. 23-16 we need only reverse the\ndirection of the rays to get our new situation.\n*do is always positive for a real object; do < 0 can happen only if the object is an image formed by\nanother mirror or lens-see Example 23-16.\nSECTION 23-3 Formation of Images by Spherical Mirrors 653\n', 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': "2\nFIGURE 23-17 Object placed within the focal\npoint F. The image is behind the mirror and is\nvirtual, Example 23-6.

(a) Draw a ray diagram to locate (approximately) the position of\nthe image. (b) Determine the position of the image and the magnification analytically.\nAPPROACH We draw the ray diagram using the rays as in Fig. 23-15, page 651.\nAn analytic solution uses Eqs. 23-1, 23-2, and 23-3.\nSOLUTION (a) Since f = r/2 = 15.0 cm, the object is between the mirror and\nthe focal point. We draw the three rays as described earlier (Fig. 23-15); they are\nshown leaving the tip of the object in Fig. 23-17. Ray 1 leaves the tip of our object\nheading toward the mirror parallel to the axis, and reflects through F. Ray 2\ncannot head toward F because it would not strike the mirror; so ray 2 must\npoint as if it started at F (dashed line in Fig. 23-17) and heads to the mirror, and\nthen is reflected parallel to the principal axis. Ray 3 is perpendicular to the\nmirror and reflects back on itself. The rays reflected from the mirror diverge and\nso never meet at a point. They appear to be coming from a point behind the\nmirror (dashed lines). This point locates the image of the tip of the arrow. The\nimage is thus behind the mirror and is virtual.\n(b) We use Eq. 23-2 to find di when do = 10.0 cm:\n1 - 1\n1\ndo\n1\n15.0 cm\n=\n-\n1\n2 - 3\n=\n1\n10.0 cm\n30.0 cm\n–\n30.0 cm\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nMagnifying mirror:\nSeeing yourself upright and\nmagnified in a concave mirror\nTherefore, di = - 30.0 cm. The minus sign means the image is behind\nthe mirror, which our diagram also showed us. The magnification is\nm= - di/do = - (-30.0 cm)/(10.0 cm) = +3.00. So the image is 3.00 times\nlarger than the object. The plus sign indicates that the image is upright (same as\nobject), which is consistent with the ray diagram, Fig. 23-17.\nNOTE The image distance cannot be obtained accurately by measuring on\nFig. 23-17, because our diagram violates the paraxial ray assumption (we draw\nrays at steeper angles to make them clearly visible).\nNOTE When the object is located inside the focal point of a concave mirror\n(do < f), the image is always upright and virtual. If the object O in Fig. 23-17 is\nyou, you see yourself clearly, because the reflected rays at point O (you) are\ndiverging. Your image is upright and enlarged. This is how a shaving or cosmetic\nmirror is used-you must place your head closer to the mirror than the focal\npoint if you are to see yourself right-side up (see the photograph, Fig. 23-11a).\n[If the object is beyond the focal point, as in Fig. 23-15, the image is real and\ninverted: upside down-and hard to use!]\nSeeing the Image; Seeing Yourself\nFor a person's eye to see a sharp image, the eye must be at a place where it inter-\ncepts diverging rays from points on the image, as is the case for the eye's position\nin Figs. 23-15, 23-16, and 23-17. When we look at normal objects, we always\ndetect rays diverging toward the eye as shown in Fig. 23-1. (Or, for very distant\nobjects like stars, the rays become essentially parallel, as in Fig. 23-12.)\n654 CHAPTER 23 Light: Geometric Optics\n", 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': "If you placed your eye between points O and I in Fig. 23-16, for example, converging\nrays from the object OO' would enter your eye and the lens of your eye could not\nbring them to a focus; you would see a blurry image or no perceptible image at\nall. [We will discuss the eye more in Chapter 25.]\nIf you are the object OO' in Fig. 23-16, situated between F and C, and are\ntrying to see yourself in the mirror, you would see a blur; but the person whose\neye is shown in Fig. 23-16 could see you clearly. If you are to the left of C in\nFig. 23-16, where do > 2f, you can see yourself clearly, but upside down. Why?\nBecause then the rays arriving from the image will be diverging at your position\n(Fig. 23-18), and your eye can then focus them. You can also see yourself clearly,\nand right side up, if you are closer to the mirror than its focal point (do < f), as\nwe saw in Example 23-6, Fig. 23-17.\nRay 2\nC\nRay 3\nO\nRay 2\nImage\nof your\nnose\nI\nRay 3\nRay 2\nF\nFIGURE 23-18 You can see a clear inverted image\nof your face in a concave mirror when you are beyond C\n(do > 2f), because the rays that arrive at your eye are\ndiverging. Standard rays 2 and 3 are shown leaving point O\non your nose. Ray 2 (and other nearby rays) enters your eye.\nNotice that rays are diverging as they move to the left of\nimage point I.\nConvex Mirrors\nThe analysis used for concave mirrors can be applied to convex mirrors. Even the\nmirror equation (Eq. 23-2) holds for a convex mirror, although the quantities\ninvolved must be carefully defined. Figure 23-19a shows parallel rays falling on\na convex mirror. Again spherical aberration is significant (Fig. 23-13), unless we\nassume the mirror is small compared to its radius of curvature. The reflected rays\ndiverge, but seem to come from point F behind the mirror, Fig. 23-19a. This is\nthe focal point, and its distance from the center of the mirror (point A) is the\nfocal length, f. The equation f = r/2 is valid also for a convex mirror. We see\nthat an object at infinity produces a virtual image in a convex mirror. Indeed, no\nmatter where the object is placed on the reflecting side of a convex mirror, the\nimage will be virtual and upright, as indicated in Fig. 23-19b. To find the image\nwe draw rays 1 and 3 according to the rules used before on the concave mirror, as\nshown in Fig. 23-19b. Note that although rays 1 and 3 don't actually pass through\npoints F and C, the line along which each is drawn does (shown dashed).\nThe mirror equation, Eq. 23-2, holds for convex mirrors but the focal length f\nand radius of curvature must be considered negative. The proof is left as a Problem.\nIt is also left as a Problem to show that Eq. 23-3 for the magnification is also valid.\nOLVING\nFIGURE 23-19 Convex mirror: (a) the\nfocal point is at F, behind the mirror;\n(b) the image I of the object at O is\nvirtual, upright, and smaller than the\nobject.

Always draw a ray diagram even though you are\ngoing to make an analytic calculation-the diagram\nserves as a check, even if not precise. From one point\non the object, draw at least two, preferably three, of\nthe easy-to-draw rays using the rules described in\nFig. 23-15. The image point is where the reflected rays\nintersect (real image) or appear to intersect (virtual).\n2. Apply the mirror equation, Eq. 23-2, and the magni-\nfication equation, Eq. 23-3. It is crucially important\nto follow the sign conventions-see the next point.\n3. Sign Conventions\n(a) When the object, image, or focal point is on the\nreflecting side of the mirror (on the left in our\ndrawings), the corresponding distance is positive.\nIf any of these points is behind the mirror (on the\nright) the corresponding distance is negative.+\n(b) The image height hi is positive if the image is\nupright, and negative if inverted, relative to the\nobject (ho is always taken as positive).\n4.

Draw a ray diagram. The ray diagram will be like Fig. 23-19b, but the large\nobject distance (do = 10.0 m) makes a precise drawing difficult. We have a\nconvex mirror, so r is negative by convention.\n2. Mirror and magnification equations. The center of curvature of a convex mir-\nror is behind the mirror, as is its focal point, so we set r = - 16.0 m so that\nthe focal length is f = r/2 = - 8.0m. The object is in front of the mirror,\ndo = 10.0 m. Solving the mirror equation, Eq. 23-2, for 1/dj gives\n1\n-8.0 m\n10.0 m\n1\n18\n80.0 m\n–\nf\n1 . 1.\ndo\n1\n=\n-\n80.0 m\n-10.0 - 8.0\n=\n-4.4 m.

The image distance is negative, -4.4 m, so the image is\nbehind the mirror. The magnification is m = +0.44, so the image is upright\n(same orientation as object, which is useful) and about half what it would be\nin a plane mirror.\n4. Check. Our results are consistent with Fig. 23-19b.\nConvex rearview mirrors on vehicles sometimes come with a warning that\nobjects are closer than they appear in the mirror. The fact that di may be smaller\nthan do (as in Example 23-7) seems to contradict this observation. The real reason\nthe object seems farther away is that its image in the convex mirror is smaller\nthan it would be in a plane mirror, and we judge distance of ordinary objects\nsuch as other cars mostly by their size.\n23-4 Index of Refraction\nWe saw in Chapter 22 that the speed of light in vacuum (like other EM waves) is\nC = 2.99792458 × 108 m/s,\nwhich is usually rounded off to\n3.00 × 108 m/s\nwhen extremely precise results are not required.\nIn air, the speed is only slightly less. In other transparent materials, such as\nglass and water, the speed is always less than that in vacuum. For example, in water\nlight travels at about ac. The ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed v\nin a given material is called the index of refraction, n, of that material:\nn = C.\nC\n(23-4)\nThe index of refraction is never less than 1, and values for various materials are\ngiven in Table 23-1. For example, since n = 1.33 for water, the speed of light\nin water is\nv =\nc\n=\n(3.00 × 108 m/s)\nn\n1.33\n= 2.26 × 108 m/s.\nAs we shall see later, n varies somewhat with the wavelength of the light-except\nin vacuum-so a particular wavelength is specified in Table 23-1, that of yellow\nlight with wavelength À = 589 nm.\nThat light travels more slowly in matter than in vacuum can be explained at\nthe atomic level as being due to the absorption and reemission of light by atoms\nand molecules of the material.\n656 CHAPTER 23 Light: Geometric Optics\n', 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Normal\nNormal\nSource\nIncident\nray\nΘ1\nReflected\nray\nRefracted\nray\n1\n1\n02\nAir (n1)\nWater (n2)\n102\nReflected\nray\n101\nAir (n2)\nWater (n1)\nIncident\nray\nRefracted\nray\nSource\nFIGURE 23-21 Refraction.\n(a) Light refracted when passing from\nair (n1) into water (n): n2 > n1.\n(b) Light refracted when passing from\nwater (n1) into air (n2): n1 > n2.\n(a) n2> n1: Ray bends toward 1\n(b) n1> n2: Ray bends away from 1\n23-5 Refraction: Snell's Law\nWhen light passes from one transparent medium into another with a different\nindex of refraction, some or all of the incident light is reflected at the boundary.\nThe rest passes into the new medium. If a ray of light is incident at an angle to the\nsurface (other than perpendicular), the ray changes direction as it enters the new\nmedium. This change in direction, or bending, of the light ray is called refraction.\nFigure 23-21a shows a ray passing from air into water. Angle 01 is the angle\nthe incident ray makes with the normal (perpendicular) to the surface and is called\nthe angle of incidence. Angle 02 is the angle of refraction, the angle the refracted ray\nmakes with the normal to the surface. Notice that the ray bends toward the normal\nwhen entering the water. This is always the case when the ray enters a medium where\nthe speed of light is less (and the index of refraction is greater, Eq. 23-4). If light\ntravels from one medium into a second where its speed is greater, the ray bends away\nfrom the normal; this is shown in Fig. 23-21b for a ray traveling from water to air.\nCAUTION\nAngles of incidence and refraction\nare measured from the perpendicular,\nnot from the surface\nFIGURE 23-22 (a) Photograph, and (b) ray diagram\nshowing why a person's legs look shorter standing in\nwater: a ray from the bather's foot to the observer's\neye bends at the water's surface, and our brain\ninterprets the light as traveling in a straight line,\nfrom higher up (dashed line).\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFoot appears to be here\n(a)\n(b)\n.\n.\nFIGURE 23-23 A straw in water\nlooks bent even when it isn't.\nRefraction is responsible for a number of common optical illusions. For example,\na person standing in waist-deep water appears to have shortened legs (Fig. 23-22).\nThe rays leaving the person's foot are bent at the surface. The observer's brain\nassumes the rays to have traveled a straight-line path (dashed red line), and so the feet\nappear to be higher than they really are. Similarly, when you put a straw in water, it\nappears to be bent (Fig. 23-23). This also means that water is deeper than it appears.\nSnell's Law\nThe angle of refraction depends on the speed of light in the two media and on the\nincident angle. An analytic relation between 01 and 02 in Fig. 23-21 was arrived\nat experimentally about 1621 by Willebrord Snell (1591-1626). Known as Snell's law,\nit is written:\nn1 sin 01 = n2 sin 02 .\n(23-5)\n01 is the angle of incidence and 02 is the angle of refraction; n1 and n2 are the respec-\ntive indices of refraction in the materials. See Fig. 23-21. The incident and refracted\nrays lie in the same plane, which also includes the perpendicular to the surface.\nSnell's law is the law of refraction. (Snell's law was derived in Section 11-13\nfor water waves where Eq. 11-20 is just a combination of Eqs. 23-5 and 23-4,\nand we derive it again in Chapter 24 using the wave theory of light.)\nSnell's law shows that if n2 > n1, then 02 < 01. Thus, if light enters a medium\nwhere n is greater (and its speed is less), the ray is bent toward the normal. And if\nn2 < n1, then 02 > 01, so the ray bends away from the normal. See Fig. 23-21.\nSNELL'S LAW\n(LAW OF REFRACTION)\nSECTION 23-5 657\n", 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Air\nGlass\nAir\n-\n60.0°\n1\n1\n1\n1\nRay\nfrom\nobject\n"Image" (where object\nappears to be) when\nviewed from above\nthrough the glass\nFIGURE 23-24 Light passing\nthrough a piece of glass\n(Example 23-8).\nCAUTION (real life)\nWater is deeper than it looks\nFIGURE 23-25 Example 23-9.\n102\n1\nx\nx\n4\nI\n7\n1\n1\nd = 1.0 m\n1\n1\n1\nGoggles\nEXERCISE C Light passes from a medium with n = 1.3 (water) into a medium with\nn = 1.5 (glass).

Light traveling in air strikes\na flat piece of uniformly thick glass at an incident angle of 60.0°, as shown in\nFig. 23-24. If the index of refraction of the glass is 1.50, (a) what is the angle of\nrefraction 0 A in the glass; (b) what is the angle Og at which the ray emerges from\nthe glass?\nAPPROACH We apply Snell\'s law twice: at the first surface, where the light enters\nthe glass, and again at the second surface where it leaves the glass and enters the air.\nSOLUTION (a) The incident ray is in air, so n1 = 1.00 and n2 = 1.50. Applying\nSnell\'s law where the light enters the glass (01 = 60.0°, 02 = 0A) gives\n(1.00) sin 60.0° = (1.50) sin 0 A\nor\nsin 0 A =\n1.50\n1.00\n- sin 60.0° = 0.5774,\nand 0A = 35.3º.\n(b) Since the faces of the glass are parallel, the incident angle at the second surface\nis also 0A (geometry), so sin 0A = 0.5774. At this second interface, n1 = 1.50\nand n2 = 1.00. Thus the ray re-enters the air at an angle 0B given by\nsin 0B =\n1.00\n1.50\nsin 0A = 0.866,\nand 0B = 60.0°. The direction of a light ray is thus unchanged by passing\nthrough a flat piece of glass of uniform thickness.\nNOTE This result is valid for any angle of incidence. The ray is displaced slightly\nto one side, however. You can observe this by looking through a piece of glass\n(near its edge) at some object and then moving your head to the side slightly so\nthat you see the object directly. It "jumps."\nEXAMPLE 23-9\nApparent depth of a pool. A swimmer has dropped her\ngoggles to the bottom of a pool at the shallow end, marked as 1.0 m deep. But\nthe goggles don\'t look that deep. Why? How deep do the goggles appear to be\nwhen you look straight down into the water?\nAPPROACH We draw a ray diagram showing two rays going upward from a point\non the goggles at a small angle, and being refracted at the water\'s (flat) surface,\nFig. 23-25. The two rays traveling upward from the goggles are refracted away\nfrom the normal as they exit the water, and so appear to be diverging from a\npoint above the goggles (dashed lines), which is why the water seems less deep\nthan it actually is. We are looking straight down, so all angles are small (but exag-\ngerated in Fig. 23-25 for clarity).\nSOLUTION To calculate the apparent depth d\' (Fig. 23-25), given a real depth\nd = 1.0 m, we use Snell\'s law with n1 = 1.33 for water and n2 = 1.0 for air:\nsin 02 = n1 sin 01 .\nWe are considering only small angles, so sin 0 ~ tan 0 ~ 0, with 0 in radians.

This effect is called total internal reflection.\nTotal internal reflection occurs only when light strikes a boundary where the\nmedium beyond has a lower index of refraction.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 23-10\nView up from under water.

The advantage is that very nearly 100% of the light\nis reflected, whereas even the best mirrors reflect somewhat less than 100%. Thus\nthe image is brighter, especially after several reflections. For glass with n = 1.50,\n0c = 41.8°. Therefore, 45° prisms will reflect all the light internally, if oriented as\nshown in the binoculars of Fig. 23-28.\n| EXERCISE E What would happen if we immersed the 45° glass prisms in Fig. 23-28 in water?\nFiber Optics; Medical Instruments\nTotal internal reflection is the principle behind fiber optics. Glass and plastic\nfibers as thin as a few micrometers in diameter are commonly used. A bundle\nof such slender transparent fibers is called a light pipe or fiber-optic cable.\nLight+ can be transmitted along the fiber with almost no loss because of total internal\nreflection. Figure 23-29 shows how light traveling down a thin fiber makes only\nglancing collisions with the walls so that total internal reflection occurs. Even if\nthe light pipe is bent gently into a complicated shape, the critical angle still won't be\nexceeded, so light is transmitted practically undiminished to the other end. Very\nsmall losses do occur, mainly by reflection at the ends and absorption within the fiber.\nImportant applications of fiber-optic cables are in communications and med-\nicine. They are used in place of wire to carry telephone calls, video signals, and\ncomputer data. The signal is a modulated light beam (a light beam whose intensity\ncan be varied) and data is transmitted at a much higher rate and with less loss and\nless interference than an electrical signal in a copper wire. Fibers have been devel-\noped that can support over one hundred separate wavelengths, each modulated to\ncarry more than 10 gigabits (1010 bits) of information per second. That amounts to a\nterabit (1012 bits) per second for one hundred wavelengths.\nThe use of fiber optics to transmit a clear picture is particularly useful in medicine,\nFig. 23-30. For example, a patient's lungs can be examined by inserting a fiber-optic\ncable known as a bronchoscope through the mouth and down the bronchial tube.\nLight is sent down an outer set of fibers to illuminate the lungs. The reflected light\nreturns up a central core set of fibers. Light directly in front of each fiber travels up\nthat fiber. At the opposite end, a viewer sees a series of bright and dark spots, much\nlike a TV screen-that is, a picture of what lies at the opposite end. Lenses are used\nat each end of the cable. The image may be viewed directly or on a monitor screen\nor film. The fibers must be optically insulated from one another, usually by a thin\ncoating of material with index of refraction less than that of the fiber. The more fibers\nthere are, and the smaller they are, the more detailed the picture. Such instruments,\nincluding bronchoscopes, colonoscopes (for viewing the colon), and endoscopes\n(stomach or other organs), are extremely useful for examining hard-to-reach\nplaces.\n*Fiber-optic devices use not only visible light but also infrared light, ultraviolet light, and microwaves.\nA\nFIGURE 23-30 (a) How a fiber-\noptic image is made.

The development of\noptical devices using lenses dates to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\nalthough the earliest record of eyeglasses dates from the late thirteenth century.\nToday we find lenses in eyeglasses, cameras, magnifying glasses, telescopes,\nbinoculars, microscopes, and medical instruments. A thin lens is usually circ-\nular, and its two faces are portions of a sphere. (Cylindrical faces are also\npossible, but we will concentrate on spherical.) The two faces can be concave,\nconvex, or plane. Several types are shown in Figs. 23-31a and b in cross section.\nThe importance of lenses is that they form images of objects-see Fig. 23-32.\nLens\nFIGURE 23-32 Converging lens\n(in holder) forms an image (large "F"\non screen at right) of a bright\nobject (illuminated "F" at the left).\nConsider parallel rays striking the double convex lens shown in cross section in\nFig. 23-33. We assume the lens is made of transparent material such as glass or\ntransparent plastic with index of refraction greater than that of the air outside. The\naxis of a lens is a straight line passing through the center of the lens and perpen-\ndicular to its two surfaces (Fig. 23-33). From Snell\'s law, we can see that each ray in\nFig. 23-33 is bent toward the axis when the ray enters the lens and again when it\nleaves the lens at the back surface. (Note the dashed lines indicating the normals to\neach surface for the top ray.) If rays parallel to the axis fall on a thin lens, they will be\nfocused to a point called the focal point, F. This will not be precisely true for a lens\nwith spherical surfaces. But it will be very nearly true-that is, parallel rays will be\nfocused to a tiny region that is nearly a point-if the diameter of the lens is small\ncompared to the radii of curvature of the two lens surfaces. This criterion is satis-\nfied by a thin lens, one that is very thin compared to its diameter, and we consider\nonly thin lenses here.\nFIGURE 23-33 Parallel rays are\nbrought to a focus by a converging\nthin lens.\nF\nAxis\nf\nSECTION 23-7 Thin Lenses; Ray Tracing 661\n', 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': "FIGURE 23-34 Image of the Sun\nburning wood.\nFIGURE 23-35 Parallel rays at an\nangle are focused on the focal plane.\nplane\nT Focal\nFa\nAxis\nFIGURE 23-36 Diverging lens.\nF\nf\n-\nRAY DIAGRAM\nFinding the image position\nformed by a thin lens\nThe rays from a point on a distant object are essentially parallel-see Fig. 23-12.\nTherefore we can say that the focal point is the image point for an object at infinity\non the lens axis, Fig. 23-33. Thus, the focal point of a lens can be found by\nlocating the point where the Sun's rays (or those from some other distant object) are\nbrought to a sharp image, Fig. 23-34. The distance of the focal point from the\ncenter of the lens is called the focal length, f, Fig. 23-33. A lens can be turned\naround so that light can pass through it from the opposite side. The focal length is\nthe same on both sides, as we shall see later, even if the curvatures of the two lens\nsurfaces are different. If parallel rays fall on a lens at an angle, as in Fig. 23-35, they\nfocus at a point Fa. The plane containing all focus points, such as F and Fa in\nFig. 23-35, is called the focal plane of the lens.\nAny lens (in air) that is thicker in the center than at the edges will make par-\nallel rays converge to a point, and is called a converging lens (see Fig. 23-31a).\nLenses that are thinner in the center than at the edges (Fig. 23-31b) are called\ndiverging lenses because they make parallel light diverge, as shown in Fig. 23-36.\nThe focal point, F, of a diverging lens is defined as that point from which refracted\nrays, originating from parallel incident rays, seem to emerge as shown in Fig. 23-36.\nAnd the distance from F to the center of the lens is called the focal length, f, just\nas for a converging lens.\n-\nEXERCISE F Return to Chapter-Opening Question 2, page 644, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nOptometrists and ophthalmologists, instead of using the focal length, use the\nreciprocal of the focal length to specify the strength of eyeglass (or contact) lenses.\nThis is called the power, P, of a lens:\nP = 1\n(23-7)\nf\nThe unit for lens power is the diopter (D), which is an inverse meter: 1 D = 1 m-1.\nFor example, a 20-cm-focal-length lens has a power P = 1/(0.20 m) = 5.0 D.\nWe will mainly use the focal length, but we will refer again to the power of a lens\nwhen we discuss eyeglass lenses in Chapter 25.\nThe most important parameter of a lens is its focal length f, which is the same\non both sides of the lens. For a converging lens, f can be measured by finding\nthe image point for the Sun or other distant objects. Once f is known, the image\nposition can be determined for any object. To find the image point by drawing rays\nwould be difficult if we had to determine the refractive angles at the front surface\nof the lens and again at the back surface where the ray exits. We can save ourselves\na lot of effort by making use of certain facts we already know, such as that a ray\nparallel to the axis of the lens passes (after refraction) through the focal point.\nTo determine an image point, we can consider only the three rays indicated in\nFig. 23-37, which uses an arrow (on the left) as the object, and a converging lens\nforming an image (dashed arrow) to the right. These rays, emanating from a single\npoint on the object, are drawn as if the lens were infinitely thin, and we show only\na single sharp bend at the center line of the lens instead of the refractions at each\nsurface. These three rays are drawn as follows:\nRay 1 is drawn parallel to the axis, Fig. 23-37a; therefore it is refracted by the\nlens so that it passes along a line through the focal point F behind the lens.\nRay 2 is drawn to pass through the other focal point F' (front side of lens\nin Fig. 23-37) and emerge from the lens parallel to the axis, Fig. 23-37b.\n(In reverse it would be a parallel ray going left and passing through F'.)\nRay 3 is directed toward the very center of the lens, where the two surfaces are\nessentially parallel to each other, Fig. 23-37c. This ray therefore emerges from\nthe lens at the same angle as it entered. The ray would be displaced slightly\nto one side, as we saw in Example 23-8; but since we assume the lens is thin,\nwe draw ray 3 straight through as shown.\nThe point where these three rays cross is the image point for that object point.\nActually, any two of these rays will suffice to locate the image point, but drawing\nthe third ray can serve as a check.\n662 CHAPTER 23\n", 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Center line\nObject\n1\nF\'\nI\nF\nO\n1\n1\nF\nF\n2\n2\n1\n(a) Ray 1 leaves one point on object\ngoing parallel to the axis, then\nrefracts through focal point behind\nthe lens.\nI\n(b) Ray 2 passes through F\' in front of the\nlens; therefore it is parallel to the axis\nbehind the lens.\nI\n(c) Ray 3 passes straight through the\ncenter of the lens (assumed very thin).\nObject\n3\nF\nO\nFʹ\n2\nImage\nUsing these three rays for one object point, we can find the image point for\nthat point of the object (the top of the arrow in Fig. 23-37). The image points for\nall other points on the object can be found similarly to determine the complete\nimage of the object. Because the rays actually pass through the image for the case\nshown in Fig. 23-37, it is a real image (see pages 647 and/or 651). The image\ncould be detected by film or electronic sensor, and actually be seen on a white\nsurface or screen placed at the position of the image (Fig. 23-38).\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 23-11\nHalf-blocked lens. What happens to the\nimage of an object if the top half of a lens is covered by a piece of cardboard?\nRESPONSE Let us look at the rays in Fig. 23-37. If the top half (or any half of the\nlens) is blocked, you might think that half the image is blocked. But in Fig. 23-37c,\nwe see how the rays used to create the "top" of the image pass through both\nthe top and the bottom of the lens. Only three of many rays are shown-many\nmore rays pass through the lens, and they can form the image. You don\'t lose\nthe image. But covering part of the lens cuts down on the total light received and\nreduces the brightness of the image.\nNOTE If the lens is partially blocked by your thumb, you may notice an out of\nfocus image of part of that thumb.\nFIGURE 23-37 Finding the\nimage by ray tracing for a\nconverging lens.

We can see a sharp image only for rays diverging\nfrom each point on the image, because we see normal objects when diverging rays\nfrom each point enter the eye as shown in Fig. 23-1. A normal eye cannot focus\nconverging rays; if your eye was positioned between points F and I in Fig. 23-37c,\nit would not see a clear image. (More about our eyes in Section 25-2.) Figure 23-38\nshows an image seen (a) on a white surface and (b) directly by the eye (and a camera)\nplaced behind the image. The eye can see both real and virtual images (see next\npage) as long as the eye is positioned so rays diverging from the image enter it.\n(b)\n@\nSECTION 23-7 Thin Lenses; Ray Tracing 663\n', 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Diverging Lens\nBy drawing the same three rays emerging from a single object point, we can deter-\nmine the image position formed by a diverging lens, as shown in Fig. 23-39.

Next we find the image\nformed by this second lens using the first image as object. This second image is\nthe final image if there are only two lenses. The total magnification will be the\nproduct of the separate magnifications of each lens. Even if the second lens inter-\ncepts the light from the first lens before it forms an image, this technique still\nworks.\nEXAMPLE 23-15\nA two-lens system. Two converging lenses, A and B, with\nfocal lengths fA = 20.0 cm and fB = 25.0 cm, are placed 80.0 cm apart, as shown\nin Fig. 23-44a. An object is placed 60.0 cm in front of the first lens as shown in\nFig. 23-44b. Determine (a) the position, and (b) the magnification, of the final\nimage formed by the combination of the two lenses.\nAPPROACH Starting at the tip of our object O, we draw rays 1, 2, and 3 for the\nfirst lens, A, and also a ray 4 which, after passing through lens A, acts for the\nsecond lens, B, as ray 3' (through the center). We use primes now for the standard\nrays relative to lens B. Ray 2 for lens A exits parallel, and so is ray 1' for lens B.\nTo determine the position of the image IA formed by lens A, we use Eq. 23-8\nwith fA = 20.0 cm and doA = 60.0 cm. The distance of IA (lens A's image)\nfrom lens B is the object distance dop for lens B. The final image is found using\nthe thin lens equation, this time with all distances relative to lens B. For (b) the\nmagnifications are found from Eq. 23-9 for each lens in turn.\nSOLUTION (a) The object is a distance doA = +60.0 cm from the first lens, A,\nand this lens forms an image whose position can be calculated using the thin lens\nequation:\n1\n=\n1\n-\n-\ndiA\nfA\ndoA\n1\n1\n=\n20.0 cm\n60.0 cm\n1\n60.0 cm\n3-1\n1\nCAUTION\nObject distance\nfor second lens is not\nequal to the image\ndistance for first lens\n30.0 cm\nSo the first image IA is at diA = 30.0 cm behind the first lens. This image\nbecomes the object for the second lens, B. It is a distance doB =\n80.0 cm - 30.0 cm = 50.0 cm in front of lens B (Fig. 23-44b). The image formed\nby lens B, again using the thin lens equation, is at a distance dip from the lens B:\n1\nFB doB\n1\n1\n-\n25.0 cm\n1\n=\n50.0 cm\n1\n2-1\n50.0 cm\n50.0 cm\ndiB\n1\nHence diB = 50.0 cm behind lens B.

To measure the focal\nlength of a diverging lens, a converging lens is placed in contact with it, as shown\nin Fig. 23-45. The Sun\'s rays are focused by this combination at a point 28.5 cm\nbehind the lenses as shown. If the converging lens has a focal length fc of 16.0 cm,\nwhat is the focal length fp of the diverging lens? Assume both lenses are thin\nand the space between them is negligible.\nAPPROACH The image distance for the first lens equals its focal length (16.0 cm)\nsince the object distance is infinity (co). The position of this image, even though\nit is never actually formed, acts as the object for the second (diverging) lens. We\napply the thin lens equation to the diverging lens to find its focal length, given\nthat the final image is at di = 28.5 cm.\nSOLUTION Rays from the Sun are focused 28.5 cm behind the combination,\nso the focal length of the total combination is fr = 28.5 cm. If the diverging lens\nwas absent, the converging lens would form the image at its focal point-that is,\nat a distance fc = 16.0 cm behind it (dashed lines in Fig. 23-45). When the\ndiverging lens is placed next to the converging lens, we treat the image formed\nby the first lens as the object for the second lens. Since this object lies to the\nright of the diverging lens, this is a situation where do is negative (see the sign\nconventions, page 665). Thus, for the diverging lens, the object is virtual and\ndo = - 16.0 cm. The diverging lens forms the image of this virtual object at a\ndistance di = 28.5 cm away (given).

Thus, if a lens is turned\naround so that light impinges on the other surface, the focal length is the same\neven if the two lens surfaces are different. This confirms what we said earlier:\na lens' focal length is the same on both sides of the lens.\nEXAMPLE 23-17\nCalculating f for a converging lens. A convex meniscus\nlens (Figs. 23-31a and 23-46) is made from glass with n = 1.50. The radius of\ncurvature of the convex surface (left in Fig. 23-46) is 22 cm.

The power of this lens is about 1.2 D.\n*Some books use a different convention: R1 and R2 may be considered positive if their centers of cur-\nvature are to the right of the lens; then a minus sign replaces the + sign in their version of Eq. 23-10.\nSummary\nLight appears to travel along straight-line paths, called rays,\nthrough uniform transparent materials including air and glass.\nWhen light reflects from a flat surface, the angle of reflection\nequals the angle of incidence. This law of reflection explains why\nmirrors can form images.\nThe ratio of image height hi to object height ho, which\nequals the magnification m of a mirror, is\nm = m = - ds.\n(23-3)\nIf the rays that converge to form an image actually pass\nthrough the image, so the image would appear on a screen or\nfilm placed there, the image is said to be a real image. If the\nlight rays do not actually pass through the image, the image is a\nvirtual image.\nIn a plane mirror, the image is virtual, upright, the same size\nas the object, and as far behind the mirror as the object is in front.\nA spherical mirror can be concave or convex. A concave\nspherical mirror focuses parallel rays of light (light from a very\ndistant object) to a point called the focal point. The distance of\nthis point from the mirror is the focal length f of the mirror and\nThe speed of light v depends on the index of refraction, n, of\nthe material:\nn = 2,\n(23-4)\nwhere r is the radius of curvature of the mirror.\nf = 2\n(23-1)\nwhere c is the speed of light in vacuum.\nParallel rays falling on a convex mirror reflect from the\nmirror as if they diverged from a common point behind the\nmirror. The distance of this point from the mirror is the focal\nlength and is considered negative for a convex mirror.\nWhen light passes from one transparent medium into\nanother, the rays bend or refract. The law of refraction\n(Snell's law) states that\nn1 sin 01 = n2 sin 02,\n(23-5)\nwhere n1 and 01 are the index of refraction and angle with the\nnormal (perpendicular) to the surface for the incident ray, and\nn2 and 02 are for the refracted ray.\nFor a given object, the approximate position and size of the\nimage formed by a mirror can be found by ray tracing. Algebrai-\ncally, the relation between image and object distances, di and do ,\nand the focal length f, is given by the mirror equation:\nWhen light rays reach the boundary of a material where the\nindex of refraction decreases, the rays will be totally internally\nreflected if the incident angle, 01, is such that Snell's law would\n1\n+\ndo di\n1 = 1.\nf\n(23-2)\n670 CHAPTER 23 Light: Geometric Optics\n", 'chapter_title': 'Light: Geometric Optics'}, {'page_number': 28, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'predict sin 02 > 1.
