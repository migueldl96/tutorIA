Because it is based in physics,\nand because this understanding is so important in many fields, we discuss it here.\nBy a molecule, we mean a group of two or more atoms that are strongly held\ntogether so as to function as a single unit.

This is a hydrogen\nmolecule, H2 .\nNucleus\n(+1e)\nNucleus\n(+1e)\n*\nCovalent Bonds\nTo understand how covalent bonds are formed, we take the simplest case, the\nbond that holds two hydrogen atoms together to form the hydrogen molecule, H2 .\nThe mechanism is basically the same for other covalent bonds. As two H atoms\napproach each other, the electron clouds begin to overlap, and the electrons from\neach atom can "orbit" both nuclei. (This is sometimes called sharing electrons.)\nIf both electrons are in the ground state (n = 1) of their respective atoms, there\nare two possibilities: their spins can be parallel (both up or both down), in which\ncase the total spin is S = 2 + 2 = 1; or their spins can be opposite (ms = +2\nfor one, and ms = - 2 for the other), so that the total spin S = 0. We shall\nnow see that a bond is formed only for the S = 0 state, when the spins are\nopposite.\nFirst we consider the S = 1 state, for which the spins are the same. The two\nelectrons cannot both be in the lowest energy state and be attached to the same\natom, for then they would have identical quantum numbers in violation of the\nexclusion principle. The exclusion principle tells us that, because no two electrons\ncan occupy the same quantum state, if two electrons have the same quantum\nnumbers, they must be different in some other way-namely, by being in different\nplaces in space (for example, attached to different atoms). Thus, for S = 1, when\nthe two atoms approach each other, the electrons will stay away from each other\nas shown by the probability distribution of Fig. 29-1. The electrons spend very\nlittle time between the two nuclei, so the positively charged nuclei repel each\nother and no bond is formed.\nFor the S = 0 state, on the other hand, the spins are opposite and the two\nelectrons are consequently in different quantum states (ms is different, + 2 for\none, - ¿ for the other). Hence the two electrons can come close together, and the\nprobability distribution looks like Fig. 29-2: the electrons can spend much of\ntheir time between the two nuclei. The two positively charged nuclei are attracted\nto the negatively charged electron cloud between them, and this is the attraction\nthat holds the two hydrogen atoms together to form a hydrogen molecule. This\nis a covalent bond.\nThe probability distributions of Figs. 29-1 and 29-2 can perhaps be better\nunderstood on the basis of waves. What the exclusion principle requires is that\nwhen the spins are the same, there is destructive interference of the electron wave\nfunctions in the region between the two atoms. But when the spins are opposite,\nconstructive interference occurs in the region between the two atoms, resulting in\na large amount of negative charge there. Thus a covalent bond can be said to be\nthe result of constructive interference of the electron wave functions in the space\nbetween the two atoms, and of the electrostatic attraction of the two positive\nnuclei for the negative charge concentration between them.\nWhy a bond is formed can also be understood from the energy point of view.\nWhen the two H atoms approach close to one another, if the spins of their elec-\ntrons are opposite, the electrons can occupy the same space, as discussed above.\nThis means that each electron can now move about in the space of two atoms\ninstead of in the volume of only one. Because each electron now occupies more\nspace, it is less well localized. From the uncertainty principle with Ax larger, we\nsee that Ap and the minimum momentum can be less. With less momentum, each\nelectron has less energy when the two atoms combine than when they are separate.\nThat is, the molecule has less energy than the two separate atoms, and so is\nmore stable. An energy input is required to break the H2 molecule into two separate\nH atoms, so the H2 molecule is a stable entity. This is what we mean by a bond.\nThe energy required to break a bond is called the bond energy, the binding energy,\nor the dissociation energy. For the hydrogen molecule, H2, the bond energy\nis 4.5 e V.\n830 CHAPTER 29 Molecules and Solids\n', 'chapter_title': '* 29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals; Fermi Energy'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': '*\nIonic Bonds\nAn ionic bond is, in a sense, a special case of the covalent bond. Instead of the\nelectrons being shared equally, they are shared unequally. For example, in sodium\nchloride (NaCl), the outer electron of the sodium spends nearly all its time\naround the chlorine (Fig. 29-3). The chlorine atom acquires a net negative charge\nas a result of the extra electron, whereas the sodium atom is left with a net positive\ncharge. The electrostatic attraction between these two charged atoms holds them\ntogether. The resulting bond is called an ionic bond because it is created by the\nattraction between the two ions (Na+ and Cl"). But to understand the ionic bond,\nwe must understand why the extra electron from the sodium spends so much of\nits time around the chlorine. After all, the chlorine atom is neutral; why should\nit attract another electron?\nThe answer lies in the probability distributions of the electrons in the two\nneutral atoms. Sodium contains 11 electrons, 10 of which are in spherically sym-\nmetric closed shells (Fig. 29-4). The last electron spends most of its time beyond\nthese closed shells. Because the closed shells have a total charge of -10e and the\nnucleus has charge +11e, the outermost electron in sodium "feels" a net attraction\ndue to +1e. It is not held very strongly. On the other hand, 12 of chlorine\'s\n17 electrons form closed shells, or subshells (corresponding to 1s22s22p63s2).\nThese 12 electrons form a spherically symmetric shield around the nucleus. The\nother five electrons are in 3p states whose probability distributions are not spher-\nically symmetric and have a form similar to those for the 2p states in hydrogen\nshown in Figs. 28-9b and c. Four of these 3p electrons can have "doughnut-\nshaped" distributions symmetric about the z axis, as shown in Fig. 29-5. The fifth\ncan have a "barbell-shaped" distribution (as for me = 0 in Fig. 28-9b), which in\nFig. 29-5 is shown only in dashed outline because it is half empty. That is, the\nexclusion principle allows one more electron to be in this state (it will have spin\nopposite to that of the electron already there). If an extra electron-say from a\nNa atom-happens to be in the vicinity, it can be in this state, perhaps at point x\nin Fig. 29-5. It could experience an attraction due to as much as +5e because the\n+17e of the nucleus is partly shielded at this point by the 12 inner electrons. Thus,\nthe outer electron of a sodium atom will be more strongly attracted by the +5e of\nthe chlorine atom than by the +1e of its own atom. This, combined with the\nstrong attraction between the two ions when the extra electron stays with the Cl",\nproduces the charge distribution of Fig. 29-3, and hence the ionic bond.\nx\n-12e\n+17e\n-4e\n+\n–\nNa\nCl\nFIGURE 29-3 Probability\ndistribution for the outermost\nelectron of Na in NaCl.\nFIGURE 29-4 In a neutral sodium\natom, the 10 inner electrons shield\nthe nucleus, so the single outer\nelectron is attracted by a net charge\nof +1e.\n-10e\nLast (3s) electron\n1-e\n+11e\nFIGURE 29-5 Neutral chlorine atom.\nThe +17e of the nucleus is shielded by the\n12 electrons in the inner shells and subshells.\nFour of the five 3p electrons are shown in\ndoughnut-shaped clouds (seen in cross section\nat left and right), and the fifth is in the\ndashed-line cloud concentrated about the\nz axis (vertical).

When the atoms involved are\ndifferent from each other, usually the shared electrons are more likely to be in\nthe vicinity of one atom than the other. The extreme case is an ionic bond. In\nintermediate cases the covalent bond is said to have a partial ionic character.\n*SECTION 29-1 831\n', 'chapter_title': '* 29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals; Fermi Energy'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'H (+)\n.+1e\n+8e\nO (-)\n-+1e\nH (+)\nFIGURE 29-6 The water molecule\nH2O is polar.\nFIGURE 29-7 Potential energy PE\nas a function of separation r for two\npoint charges of (a) like sign and\n(b) opposite sign.\nPE\nRepulsive force\n(two like charges)\n0\n(a)\nPE\n0\nr\nr\nAttractive force\n(unlike charges)\nThe molecules themselves are polar-that is, one part (or parts) of the molecule has\na net positive charge and other parts a net negative charge. An example is the\nwater molecule, H2O (Fig. 29-6). Covalent bonds have shared electrons, which\nin H2O are more likely to be found around the oxygen atom than around the two\nhydrogens. The reason is similar to that discussed above in connection with ionic\nbonds. Oxygen has eight electrons (1s22s22p4), of which four form a spherically\nsymmetric core and the other four could have, for example, a doughnut-shaped\ndistribution. The barbell-shaped distribution on the z axis (like that shown\ndashed in Fig. 29-5) could be empty, so electrons from hydrogen atoms can be\nattracted by a net charge of +4e. They are also attracted by the H nuclei, so they\npartly orbit the H atoms as well as the O atom. The net effect is that there is a net\npositive charge on each H atom (less than +1e), because the electrons spend only\npart of their time there. And, there is a net negative charge on the O atom.\n29-2 Potential-Energy Diagrams\nfor Molecules\nIt is useful to analyze the interaction between two objects-say, between two\natoms or molecules-with the use of a potential-energy diagram, which is a plot\nof the potential energy versus the separation distance.\nFor the simple case of two point charges, q1 and q2, the potential energy PE is\ngiven by (we combine Eqs. 17-2a and 17-5)\nPE = k 11 92,\nr\nwhere r is the distance between the charges, and the constant k (= 1/4TTE0) is\nequal to 9.0 × 109 N ·m2/C2. If the two charges have the same sign, the potential\nenergy is positive for all values of r, and a graph of PE versus r in this case is\nshown in Fig. 29-7a. The force is repulsive (the charges have the same sign) and\nthe curve rises as r decreases; this makes sense because if one particle moves\nfreely toward the other (r getting smaller), the repulsion slows it down so its KE\ngets smaller, meaning PE gets larger. If, on the other hand, the two charges are of\nthe opposite sign, the potential energy is negative because the product q192 is\nnegative. The force is attractive in this case, and the graph of PE (x -1/r) versus r\nlooks like Fig. 29-7b. The potential energy becomes more negative as r decreases.\nNow let us look at the potential-energy diagram for the formation of a cova-\nlent bond, such as for the hydrogen molecule, H2 . The potential energy PE of one\nH atom in the presence of the other is plotted in Fig. 29-8. Starting at large r, the\nPE decreases as the atoms approach, because the electrons concentrate between\nthe two nuclei (Fig. 29-2), so attraction occurs. However, at very short distances,\nthe electrons would be "squeezed out"-there is no room for them between\nthe two nuclei. Without the electrons between them, each nucleus would feel\na repulsive force due to the other, so the curve rises as r decreases further.\n(b)\nPE\nFIGURE 29-8 Potential-energy diagram for the\nH2 molecule; r is the separation of the two H atoms.\nThe binding energy (the energy difference between\nPE = 0 and the lowest energy state near the bottom\nof the well) is 4.5 eV, and r0 = 0.074 nm.\nr0\n0\n+\nBinding\nenergy\nThis part\ncorresponds\nto repulsive force\nr\nThis part corresponds\nto attractive force\nLowest energy state\n832 CHAPTER 29 Molecules and Solids\n', 'chapter_title': '* 29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals; Fermi Energy'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'There is an optimum separation of the atoms, ro in Fig. 29-8, at which the energy\nis lowest. This is the point of greatest stability for the hydrogen molecule, and\nr0 is the average separation of atoms in the H2 molecule. The depth of this\n"well" is the binding energy,+ as shown. This is how much energy must be put\ninto the system to separate the two atoms to infinity, where the PE = 0. For the\nH 2 molecule, the binding energy is about 4.5 eV and r0 = 0.074 nm.\nFor many bonds, the potential-energy curve has the shape shown in Fig. 29-9.\nThere is still an optimum distance r0 at which the molecule is stable. But when\nthe atoms approach from a large distance, the force is initially repulsive rather than\nattractive. The atoms thus do not form a bond spontaneously. Some additional\nenergy must be injected into the system to get it over the "hump" (or barrier) in\nthe potential-energy diagram. This required energy is called the activation energy.\nPE\nr0\n0\n1\nBinding\nenergy\nActivation\nenergy\nFIGURE 29-9 Potential-energy\ndiagram for a bond requiring an\nactivation energy.\nr\nRepulsion\nAttraction\nRepulsion\nThe curve of Fig. 29-9 is much more common than that of Fig. 29-8. The acti-\nvation energy often reflects a need to break other bonds, before the one under\ndiscussion can be made. For example, to make water from O2 and H2, the H2 and\nO2 molecules must first be broken into H and O atoms by an input of energy; this\nis what the activation energy represents. Then the H and O atoms can combine to\nform H2O with the release of a great deal more energy than was put in initially.\nThe initial activation energy can be provided by applying an electric spark to a\nmixture of H2 and O2, breaking a few of these molecules into H and O atoms.\nWhen these atoms combine to form H2O, a lot of energy is released (the ground\nstate is near the bottom of the well) which provides the activation energy needed\nfor further reactions: additional H2 and O2 molecules are broken up and\nrecombined to form H2O.\nThe potential-energy diagrams for ionic bonds, such as NaCl, may be more\nlike Fig. 29-8: the Na+ and Cl" ions attract each other at distances a bit larger\nthan some r0 , but at shorter distances the overlapping of inner electron shells gives\nrise to repulsion. The two atoms thus are most stable at some intermediate separa-\ntion, ro . For partially ionic bonds, there is usually an activation energy, Fig. 29-9.\nSometimes the potential energy of a bond looks like that of Fig. 29-10. In\nthis case, the energy of the bonded molecule, at a separation r0 , is greater than\nwhen there is no bond (r = 00). That is, an energy input is required to make the\nbond (hence the binding energy is negative), and there is energy release when\nthe bond is broken. Such a bond is stable only because there is the barrier of the\nactivation energy. This type of bond is important in living cells, for it is in such\nbonds that energy can be stored efficiently in certain molecules, particularly ATP\n(adenosine triphosphate). The bond that connects the last phosphate group\n(designated P in Fig. 29-10) to the rest of the molecule (ADP, meaning adeno-\nsine diphosphate, since it contains only two phosphates) has potential energy of\nthe shape shown in Fig. 29-10. Energy is stored in this bond. When the bond is\nbroken (ATP -> ADP + (P), energy is released and this energy can be used to\nmake other chemical reactions "go."\n*The binding energy corresponds not quite to the bottom of the potential-energy curve, but to the\nlowest quantum energy state, slightly above the bottom, as shown in Fig. 29-8.\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nATP and energy in the cell\nFIGURE 29-10 Potential-energy\ndiagram for the formation of ATP\nfrom ADP and phosphate (P).\nPE\nr 0\nr\nATP\nADP +\nP\n*SECTION 29-2 Potential-Energy Diagrams for Molecules 833\n', 'chapter_title': '* 29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals; Fermi Energy'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'In living cells, many chemical reactions have activation energies that are\noften on the order of several eV.

See\nalso Section 16-10 and Figs. 16-39\nand 16-40.\nOnce a bond between two atoms or ions is made, energy must normally be sup-\nplied to break the bond and separate the atoms. As mentioned in Section 29-1,\nthis energy is called the bond energy or binding energy. The binding energy for\ncovalent and ionic bonds is typically 2 to 5 eV. These bonds, which hold atoms\ntogether to form molecules, are often called strong bonds to distinguish them\nfrom so-called "weak bonds." The term weak bond, as we use it here, refers to an\nattachment between molecules due to simple electrostatic attraction-such as\nbetween polar molecules (and not within a polar molecule, which is a strong\nbond). The strength of the attachment is much less than for the strong bonds.\nBinding energies are typically in the range 0.04 to 0.3 eV-hence their name\n"weak bonds."\nWeak bonds are generally the result of attraction between dipoles. (A pair of\nequal point charges q of opposite sign, separated by a distance l, is called an\nelectric dipole, as we saw in Chapter 17.) For example, Fig. 29-11 shows two mole-\ncules, which have permanent dipole moments, attracting one another. Besides such\ndipole-dipole bonds, there can also be dipole-induced dipole bonds, in which a\npolar molecule with a permanent dipole moment can induce a dipole moment in\nan otherwise electrically balanced (nonpolar) molecule, just as a single charge\ncan induce a separation of charge in a nearby object (see Fig. 16-7). There can\neven be an attraction between two nonpolar molecules, because their electrons\nare moving about: at any instant there may be a transient separation of charge,\ncreating a brief dipole moment and weak attraction. All these weak bonds are\nreferred to as van der Waals bonds, and the forces involved van der Waals forces.\nThe potential energy has the general shape shown in Fig. 29-8, with the attractive\nvan der Waals potential energy varying as 1/r6. The force decreases greatly with\nincreased distance.\nWhen one of the atoms in a dipole-dipole bond is hydrogen, as in Fig. 29-11,\nit is called a hydrogen bond. A hydrogen bond is generally the strongest of the\nweak bonds, because the hydrogen atom is the smallest atom and can be approached\nmore closely. Hydrogen bonds also have a partial "covalent" character: that is,\nelectrons between the two dipoles may be shared to a small extent, making a\nstronger, more lasting bond.\nWeak bonds are very important for understanding the activities of cells,\nsuch as the double helix shape of DNA (Fig. 29-12), and DNA replication\nA\nC\n...\nGF\nT\nA\nG\nT\nG\nC\nA\n.....\nT\nC\nC\nG\nCytosine (C)\nH\n-0.290 nm-\nH\nN\nH\n–\nO\nC\nH\nC\nGuanine (G)\nN\nH\nC\nC\nN\nin\nC)\n+\n–\n+\n-0.300 nm-\nC\nN\n–\n.

The average kinetic energy of molecules in a living cell at\nnormal temperatures (T ~ 300 K) is around 2kT ~ 0.04 eV (kinetic theory,\nChapter 13), about the magnitude of weak bonds. This means that a weak bond\ncan readily be broken just by a molecular collision. Hence weak bonds are not\nvery permanent-they are, instead, brief attachments. This helps them play par-\nticular roles in the cell. On the other hand, strong bonds-those that hold\nmolecules together-are almost never broken simply by molecular collision\nbecause their binding energies are much higher (~2 to 5 eV). Thus they are\nrelatively permanent. They can be broken by chemical action (the making of\neven stronger bonds), and this usually happens in the cell with the aid of an\nenzyme, which is a protein molecule.\nEXAMPLE 29-1\nNucleotide energy.

(See\nEqs. 17-2 and 17-5.)\nSOLUTION The potential energy consists of four terms:\nPE = PECH + PECN + PEOH + PEON\nwhere PECH means the potential energy of C in the presence of H, and similarly\nfor the other terms.

Proteins serve as structural parts of the cell and as enzymes to catalyze\nchemical reactions needed for the growth and survival of the organism. A protein\nmolecule consists of one or more chains of small molecules known as amino acids.\nThere are 20 different amino acids, and a single protein chain may contain\nhundreds of them in a specific order. The standard model for how amino acids\nare connected together in the correct order to form a protein molecule is shown\nschematically in Fig. 29-13.\nWe begin at the DNA double helix: each gene on a chromosome contains the\ninformation for producing one protein. The ordering of the four bases, A, C, G,\nand T, provides the "code," the genetic code, for the order of amino acids in\nthe protein. First, the DNA double helix unwinds and a new molecule called\nmessenger-RNA (m-RNA) is synthesized using one strand of the DNA as a\n"template." m-RNA is a chain molecule containing four different bases, like\nthose of DNA (Section 16-10) except that thymine (T) is replaced by the similar\nuracil molecule (U). Near the top left in Fig. 29-13, a C has just been added to\nthe growing m-RNA chain in much the same way that DNA replicates\n(Fig. 16-40); and an A, attracted and held close to the T on the DNA chain by the\nelectrostatic force, will soon be attached to the C by an enzyme. The order of\nthe bases, and thus the genetic information, is preserved in the m-RNA because\nthe shapes of the molecules only allow the "proper" one to get close enough so the\nelectrostatic force can act to form weak bonds.\nNext, the m-RNA is buffeted about in the cell (recall kinetic theory, Chapter 13)\nuntil it gets close to a tiny organelle known as a ribosome, to which it can attach\nby electrostatic attraction (on the right in Fig. 29-13), because their shapes allow the\ncharged parts to get close enough to form weak bonds. (Recall that force\ndecreases greatly with separation distance.) Also held by the electrostatic force\nto the ribosome are one or two transfer-RNA (t-RNA) molecules. These t-RNA\nmolecules "translate" the genetic code of nucleotide bases into amino acids in\nthe following way. There is a different t-RNA molecule for each amino acid and\neach combination of three bases. On one end of a t-RNA molecule is an amino\nacid. On the other end of the t-RNA molecule is the appropriate "anticodon,"\na set of three nucleotide bases that "code" for that amino acid. If all three\nbases of an anticodon match the three bases of the "codon" on the m-RNA (in\nthe sense of G to C and A to U), the anticodon is attracted electrostatically\nto the m-RNA codon and that t-RNA molecule is held there briefly.

As each amino acid is connected by an enzyme\n(four are already connected in Fig. 29-13, top right, and a fifth is about to be\nconnected), the old t-RNA molecule is removed-perhaps by a random collision\nwith some molecule in the cellular fluid. A new one soon becomes attracted as\nthe ribosome moves along the m-RNA.\nThis process of protein synthesis is often presented as if it occurred in clock-\nwork fashion-as if each molecule knew its role and went to its assigned place.\nBut this is not the case. The forces of attraction between the electric charges of\nthe molecules are rather weak and become significant only when the molecules can\ncome close together, and when several weak bonds can be made. Indeed, if the\nshapes are not just right, the electrostatic attraction is nearly zero, which is why\nthere are few mistakes. The fact that weak bonds are weak is very important. If they\nwere strong, collisions with other molecules would not allow a t-RNA molecule\nto be released from the ribosome, or the m-RNA to be released from the DNA.\nIf they were not temporary encounters, metabolism would grind to a halt.\nAs each amino acid is added to the next, the protein molecule grows in length\nuntil it is complete. Even as it is being made, this chain is being buffeted about in\nthe cell-we might think of a wiggling worm. But a protein molecule has electrically\ncharged polar groups along its length. And as it takes on various shapes, the\nelectric forces of attraction between different parts of the molecule will even-\ntually lead to a particular shape of the protein which is quite stable. Each type of\nprotein has its own special shape, depending on the location of charged atoms. In\nthe last analysis, the final shape depends on the order of the amino acids.\n*\n29-4 Molecular Spectra\nWhen atoms combine to form molecules, the probability distributions of the outer\nelectrons overlap and this interaction alters the energy levels. Nonetheless, mol-\necules can undergo transitions between electron energy levels just as atoms do.\nFor example, the H2 molecule can absorb a photon of just the right frequency to\nexcite one of its ground-state electrons to an excited state. The excited electron\ncan then return to the ground state, emitting a photon. The energy of photons\nemitted by molecules can be of the same order of magnitude as for atoms,\ntypically 1 to 10 eV, or less.\nAdditional energy levels become possible for molecules (but not for atoms)\nbecause the molecule as a whole can rotate, and the atoms of the molecule can\nvibrate relative to each other. The energy levels for both rotational and vibrational\nlevels are quantized, and are generally spaced much more closely (10-3 to 10-1 eV)\nthan the electronic levels. Each atomic energy level thus becomes a set of closely\nspaced levels corresponding to the vibrational and rotational motions, Fig. 29-14.\nTransitions from one level to another appear as many very closely spaced lines.\nIn fact, the lines are not always distinguishable, and these spectra are called\nband spectra. Each type of molecule has its own characteristic spectrum, which\ncan be used for identification and for determination of structure. We now look in\nmore detail at rotational and vibrational states in molecules.\n3p\n2s\nFIGURE 29-14 (a) The individual\nenergy levels of an isolated atom\nbecome (b) bands of closely spaced\nlevels in molecules, as well as in\nsolids and liquids.\nIsolated atom\n(a)\nAtom in a molecule\n(b)\n*SECTION 29-4 Molecular Spectra 837\n', 'chapter_title': '* 29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals; Fermi Energy'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': '!\nf\n1\nm1\nr1\n1 CM\n1\nr2\nr\n1\nm2\n-\nRotation\naxis\n--\nFIGURE 29-15 Diatomic molecule\nrotating about a vertical axis.\nFIGURE 29-16 Rotational energy\nlevels and allowed transitions\n(emission and absorption) for a\ndiatomic molecule.

This active field of research today is called solid-state physics, or\ncondensed-matter physics so as to include liquids as well. The rest of this Chapter\nis devoted to this subject, and we begin with a brief look at the structure of solids\nand the bonds that hold them together.\nAlthough some solid materials are amorphous in structure (such as glass), in\nthat the atoms and molecules show no long-range order, we are interested here\nin the large class of crystalline substances whose atoms, ions, or molecules are\ngenerally accepted to form an orderly array known as a lattice. Figure 29-19\nshows three of the possible arrangements of atoms in a crystal: simple cubic,\nface-centered cubic, and body-centered cubic. The NaCl crystal lattice is shown\nin Fig. 29-20.\nThe molecules of a solid are held together in a number of ways. The most\ncommon are by covalent bonding (such as between the carbon atoms of the diamond\ncrystal) and by ionic bonding (as in a NaCl crystal). Often the bonds are partially\ncovalent and partially ionic. Our discussion of these bonds earlier in this Chapter\nfor molecules applies equally well to solids.\nLet us look for a moment at the NaCl crystal of Fig. 29-20. Each Na+ ion\nfeels an attractive Coulomb potential due to each of the six "nearest neighbor"\nCl" ions surrounding it. Note that one Na+ does not "belong" exclusively to\none Cl", so we must not think of ionic solids as consisting of individual mole-\ncules. Each Na+ also feels a repulsive Coulomb potential due to other Na+ ions,\nalthough this is weaker since the Na+ ions are farther away.\nA different type of bond occurs in metals. Metal atoms have relatively\nloosely held outer electrons. Metallic bond theories propose that in a metallic\nsolid, these outer electrons roam rather freely among all the metal atoms which,\nwithout their outer electrons, act like positive ions. According to the theory, the\nelectrostatic attraction between the metal ions and this negative electron "gas" is\nresponsible, at least in part, for holding the solid together. The binding energy of\nmetal bonds is typically 1 to 3 eV, somewhat weaker than ionic or covalent bonds\n(5 to 10 eV in solids). The "free electrons" are responsible for the high electrical\nand thermal conductivity of metals. This theory also nicely accounts for the\nshininess of smooth metal surfaces: the free electrons can vibrate at any frequency,\nso when light of a range of frequencies falls on a metal, the electrons can vibrate\nin response and re-emit light of those same frequencies. Hence, the reflected\nlight will consist largely of the same frequencies as the incident light. Compare\nthis to nonmetallic materials that have a distinct color-the atomic electrons\nexist only in certain energy states, and when white light falls on them, the atoms\nabsorb at certain frequencies, and reflect other frequencies which make up the\ncolor we see.\nHere is a brief comparison of important strong bonds:\n· ionic: an electron is "grabbed" from one atom by another;\n· covalent: electrons are shared by atoms within a single molecule;\n· metallic: electrons are shared by all atoms in the metal.\nThe atoms or molecules of some materials, such as the noble gases, can form\nonly weak bonds with each other. As we saw in Section 29-3, weak bonds have\nvery low binding energies and would not be expected to hold atoms together as a\nliquid or solid at room temperature. The noble gases condense only at very low\ntemperatures, where the atomic (thermal) kinetic energy is small and the weak\nattraction can then hold the atoms together.\n840 CHAPTER 29 Molecules and Solids\n', 'chapter_title': '* 29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals; Fermi Energy'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXERCISE D Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 829, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\n*\n29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals;\nFermi Energy\nThe free-electron theory of metals considers electrons in a metal as being in con-\nstant motion like an ideal gas, which we discussed in Chapter 13. For a classical\nideal gas, at very low temperatures near absolute zero, T = 0 K, all the particles\nwould be in the lowest state, with zero kinetic energy (= 2kT = 0). But the\nsituation is vastly different for an electron gas because, according to quantum\nmechanics, electrons obey the exclusion principle and can be only in certain\npossible energy levels or states. Electrons also obey a quantum statistics called\nFermi-Dirac statistics+ that takes into account the exclusion principle. All parti-\ncles that have spin 2 (or other half-integral spin: 2, 2, etc.), such as electrons,\nprotons, and neutrons, obey Fermi-Dirac statistics and are referred to as fermions\n(see Section 28-7). The electron gas in a metal is often called a Fermi gas.\nAccording to the exclusion principle, no two electrons in the metal can have the\nsame set of quantum numbers. Therefore, in each of the energy states available\nfor the electrons in our "gas," there can be at most two electrons: one with spin up\n(ms = +2) and one with spin down (ms = - 2). Thus, at T = OK, the possible\nenergy levels will be filled, two electrons each, up to a maximum level called the\nFermi level. This is shown in Fig. 29-21, where the vertical axis is the "density of\noccupied states," whose meaning is similar to the Maxwell distribution for a\nclassical gas (Section 13-10). The energy of the state at the Fermi level is called\nthe Fermi energy, EF. For copper, EF = 7.0 eV. This is very much greater than\nthe energy of thermal motion at room temperature (KE = 2kT ~ 0.04 eV,\nEq. 13-8). Clearly, all motion does not stop at absolute zero.\nT = OK\nFermi level\nDensity of occupied states\nAt T = 0, all states with energy below EF are occupied, and all states above\nEF are empty. What happens for T > 0? We expect that at least some of the\nelectrons will increase in energy due to thermal motion. Figure 29-22 shows the\ndensity of occupied states for T = 1200 K, a temperature at which a metal is so\nhot it would glow. We see that the distribution differs very little from that at\nT = 0. We see also that the changes that do occur are concentrated about the\nFermi level. A few electrons from slightly below the Fermi level move to energy\nstates slightly above it. The average energy of the electrons increases only very\nslightly when the temperature is increased from T = 0 K to T = 1200 K. This is\nvery different from the behavior of an ideal gas, for which kinetic energy\nincreases directly with T. Nonetheless, this behavior is readily understood as\nfollows. Energy of thermal motion at T = 1200 K is about 2kT ~ 0.1 eV. The\nFermi level, on the other hand, is on the order of several eV: for copper it is\nEF ~ 7.0 eV. An electron at T = 1200 K may have 7 eV of energy, but it can\nacquire at most only a few times 0.1 eV of energy by a (thermal) collision with\nthe lattice. Only electrons very near the Fermi level would find vacant states\nclose enough to make such a transition. Essentially none of the electrons could\nincrease in energy by, say, 3 eV, so electrons farther down in the electron gas are\nunaffected. Only electrons near the top of the energy distribution can be ther-\nmally excited to higher states. And their new energy is on the average only\nslightly higher than their old energy. This model of free electrons in a metal as a\n"gas," though incomplete, provides good explanations for the thermal and\nelectrical conductivity of metals.\nFermi energy\n0\n2 4 6\nE (eV)\nFIGURE 29-21 At T = 0K, all\nstates up to energy EF, called the\nFermi energy, are filled.

(As we saw, only one of these states, S = 0, has low\nenough energy to give a bound H2 molecule.) Figure 29-23a shows this situation\nfor 1s and 2s states for two atoms: as the two atoms get closer (toward the left in\nFig. 29-23a), the 1s and 2s states split into two levels. If six atoms come together,\nas in Fig. 29-23b, each of the states splits into six levels. If a large number of\natoms come together to form a solid, then each of the original atomic levels\nbecomes a band as shown in Fig. 29-23c. The energy levels are so close together\nin each band that they seem essentially continuous. This is why the spectrum of\nheated solids (Section 27-2) appears continuous.

Consider sodium metal, for example, whose\nenergy bands are shown in Fig. 29-24. The 1s, 2s, and 2p bands are full (just as in\na sodium atom) and don\'t concern us. The 3s band, however, is only half full. To\nsee why, recall that the exclusion principle stipulates that in an atom, only two\nelectrons can be in the 3s state, one with spin up and one with spin down. These\ntwo states have slightly different energy. For a solid consisting of N atoms, the 3s\nband will contain 2N possible energy states. A sodium atom has a single 3s electron,\nso in a sample of sodium metal containing N atoms, there are N electrons in the\n3s band, and N unoccupied states. When a potential difference is applied across\nthe metal, electrons can respond by accelerating and increasing their energy, since\nthere are plenty of unoccupied states of slightly higher energy available. Hence,\na current flows readily and sodium is a good conductor. The characteristic of all\ngood conductors is that the highest energy band is only partially filled, or two\nbands overlap so that unoccupied states are available. An example of the latter\nis magnesium, which has two 3s electrons, so its 3s band is filled. But the unfilled\n3p band overlaps the 3s band in energy, so there are lots of available states for the\nelectrons to move into. Thus magnesium, too, is a good conductor.\nIn a material that is a good insulator, on the other hand, the highest band\ncontaining electrons, called the valence band, is completely filled. The next\nhighest energy band, called the conduction band, is separated from the valence\nband by a "forbidden" energy gap (or band gap), Eg, of typically 5 to 10 eV. So\nat room temperature (300 K), where thermal energies (that is, average kinetic\nenergy-see Chapter 13) are on the order of 2kT ~ 0.04 eV, almost no electrons\ncan acquire the 5 eV needed to reach the conduction band. When a potential\ndifference is applied across the material, no available states are accessible to the\nelectrons, and no current flows. Hence, the material is a good insulator.\n842 CHAPTER 29 Molecules and Solids\n', 'chapter_title': '* 29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals; Fermi Energy'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Conduction band\nEg\nConduction band\nEg\nValence band\nValence band\n(a) Conductor\n(b) Insulator\n(c) Semiconductor\nFigure 29-25 compares the relevant energy bands (a) for conductors,\n(b) for insulators, and also (c) for the important class of materials known as\nsemiconductors. The bands for a pure (or intrinsic) semiconductor, such as silicon\nor germanium, are like those for an insulator, except that the unfilled conduction\nband is separated from the filled valence band by a much smaller energy gap,\nEg , which for silicon is Eg = 1.12 eV. At room temperature, electrons are moving\nabout with varying amounts of kinetic energy (KE = 2kT), according to kinetic\ntheory, Chapter 13. A few electrons can acquire enough thermal energy to reach\nthe conduction band, and so a very small current may flow when a voltage is\napplied. At higher temperatures, more electrons have enough energy to jump the\ngap (top end of thermal distribution-see Fig. 13-20). Often this effect can more\nthan offset the effects of more frequent collisions due to increased disorder at\nhigher temperature, so the resistivity of semiconductors can decrease with increas-\ning temperature (see Table 18-1). But this is not the whole story of semiconductor\nconduction. When a potential difference is applied to a semiconductor, the few\nelectrons in the conduction band move toward the positive electrode. Electrons\nin the valence band try to do the same thing, and a few can because there are\na small number of unoccupied states which were left empty by the electrons\nreaching the conduction band. Such unfilled electron states are called holes.\nEach electron in the valence band that fills a hole in this way as it moves toward\nthe positive electrode leaves behind its own hole, so the holes migrate toward\nthe negative electrode. As the electrons tend to accumulate at one side of the\nmaterial, the holes tend to accumulate on the opposite side. We will look at this\nphenomenon in more detail in the next Section.\nEXAMPLE 29-4\nCalculating the energy gap. It is found that the conduc-\ntivity of a certain semiconductor increases when light of wavelength 345 nm or\nshorter strikes it, suggesting that electrons are being promoted from the valence\nband to the conduction band.

Silicon's energy gap is small\nenough to absorb these photons, thus bumping electrons well up into the con-\nduction band, so silicon is opaque. On the other hand, zinc sulfide's energy gap\nis so large that no visible-light photons would be absorbed; they would pass\nright through the material which would thus be transparent.\nFIGURE 29-25 Energy bands for\n(a) a conductor, (b) an insulator,\nwhich has a large energy gap Eg,\nand (c) a semiconductor, which has\na small energy gap Eg .

An atom of\nsilicon has four outer electrons (group IV of the Periodic Table) that act to hold\nthe atoms in the regular lattice structure of the crystal, shown schematically in\nFig. 29-26a. Silicon acquires properties useful for electronics when a tiny amount\nof impurity is introduced into the crystal structure (perhaps 1 part in 106 or 107).\nThis is called doping the semiconductor. Two kinds of doped semiconductor can\nbe made, depending on the type of impurity used. The impurity can be an element\nwhose atoms have five outer electrons (group V in the Periodic Table), such as arsenic.\nThen we have the situation shown in Fig. 29-26b, with a few arsenic atoms holding\npositions in the crystal lattice where normally silicon atoms are. Only four of arsenic's\nelectrons fit into the bonding structure. The fifth does not fit in and can move\nrelatively freely, somewhat like the electrons in a conductor. Because of this small\nnumber of extra electrons, a doped semiconductor becomes slightly conducting.\nThe density of conduction electrons in an intrinsic (= undoped) semiconductor at\nroom temperature is very low, usually less than 1 per 109 atoms. With an impurity\nconcentration of 1 in 106 or 107 when doped, the conductivity will be much higher\nand it can be controlled with great precision. An arsenic-doped silicon crystal is an\nn-type semiconductor because negative charges (electrons) carry the electric current.\nFIGURE 29-26 Two-dimensional\nrepresentation of a silicon crystal.\n(a) Four (outer) electrons surround\neach silicon atom. (b) Silicon crystal\ndoped with a small percentage of\narsenic atoms: the extra electron\ndoesn't fit into the crystal lattice and\nso is free to move about. This is an\nn-type semiconductor.\nCAUTION\np-type semiconductors act as\nthough + charges move-but\nelectrons actually do the moving\nSilicon atom\nSilicon atom\nElectron\n(a)\n(b)\nIn a p-type semiconductor, a small percentage of semiconductor atoms are\nreplaced by atoms with three outer electrons (group III in the Periodic Table),\nsuch as boron. As shown in Fig. 29-27a, there is a hole in the lattice structure near\na boron atom because it has only three outer electrons. An electron from a nearby\nsilicon atom can jump into this hole and fill it. But this leaves a hole where that\nelectron had previously been, Fig. 29-27b. The vast majority of atoms are silicon,\nso holes are almost always next to a silicon atom. Since silicon atoms require four\nouter electrons to be neutral, this means there is a net positive charge at the hole.\nWhenever an electron moves to fill a hole, the positive hole is then at the previous\nposition of that electron. Another electron can then fill this hole, and the hole thus\nmoves to a new location; and so on. This type of semiconductor is called p-type\nbecause it is the positive holes that carry the electric current .* Note, however, that\nboth p-type and n-type semiconductors have no net charge on them.\nArsenic\natom\nExtra\nelectron\n*Each electron that fills a hole moves a very short distance (~1 atom < 1 nm) whereas holes move\nmuch larger distances and so are the real carriers of the current.

In an n-type semiconductor, the impurity energy level lies just below\nthe conduction band, Fig. 29-28a. Electrons in this energy level need only about\n0.05 eV in Si to reach the conduction band which is on the order of the thermal\nenergy, 2 kT (~ 0.04 eV at 300 K). At room temperature, the tiny % of electrons\nin this donor level (roughly 1 in 106) can readily make the transition upward.\nThis energy level can thus supply electrons to the conduction band, so it is called\na donor level. In p-type semiconductors, the impurity energy level is just above\nthe valence band (Fig. 29-28b). It is called an acceptor level because electrons\nfrom the valence band can jump into it with only average thermal energy. Posi-\ntive holes are left behind in the valence band, and as other electrons move into\nthese holes, the holes move as discussed earlier.\nEXERCISE E Which of the following impurity atoms in silicon would produce a p-type\nsemiconductor?

The miniaturization achieved today allows many billions of\ndiodes, transistors, resistors, etc., to be fabricated (adding doping atoms) on a\nsingle chip less than a millimeter on a side.\nAt the interface between an n-type and a p-type semiconductor, a pn junction\ndiode is formed. Separately, the two semiconductors are electrically neutral. But near\nthe junction, a few electrons diffuse from the n-type into the p-type semiconductor,\nwhere they fill a few of the holes. The n-type is left with a positive charge, and\nthe p-type acquires a net negative charge. Thus an "intrinsic" potential difference is\nestablished, with the n side positive relative to the p side, and this prevents further\ndiffusion of electrons. The "junction" is actually a very thin layer between the\ncharged n and p semiconductors where all holes are filled with electrons. This\njunction region is called the depletion layer (depleted of electrons and holes).+\nIf a battery is connected to a diode with the positive terminal to the p side\nand the negative terminal to the n side as in Fig. 29-29a, the externally applied\nvoltage opposes the intrinsic potential difference and the diode is said to be\nforward biased. If the voltage is great enough, about 0.6 V for Si at room\ntemperature, it overcomes that intrinsic potential difference and a large current can\nflow. The positive holes in the p-type semiconductor are repelled by the positive\nterminal of the battery, and the electrons in the n-type are repelled by the nega-\ntive terminal of the battery. The holes and electrons meet at the junction, and the\nelectrons cross over and fill the holes. A current is flowing. The positive terminal\nof the battery is continually pulling electrons off the p end, forming new holes,\nand electrons are being supplied by the negative terminal at the n end.\nWhen the diode is reverse biased, as in Fig. 29-29b, the holes in the p end are\nattracted to the battery\'s negative terminal and the electrons in the n end are\nattracted to the positive terminal. Almost no current carriers meet near the\njunction and, ideally, no current flows.\n+One way to form the pn boundary at the nanometer thicknesses on chips is to implant (or diffuse)\nn-type donor atoms into the surface of a p-type semiconductor, converting a layer of the p-type\nsemiconductor into n-type.\nFIGURE 29-29 Schematic diagram\nshowing how a semiconductor diode\noperates.

The diode whose current-voltage characteristics\nare shown in Fig. 29-30 is connected in series with a 4.0-V battery in forward\nbias and a resistor. If a current of 15 mA is to pass through the diode, what resis-\ntance must the resistor have?\nAPPROACH We use Fig. 29-30, where we see that the voltage drop across the\ndiode is about 0.7 V when the current is 15 mA. Then we use simple circuit\nanalysis and Ohm's law (Chapters 18 and 19).\nSOLUTION The voltage drop across the resistor is 4.0 V - 0.7 V = 3.3 V, so\nR= V/I = (3.3V)/(1.5 × 10-2 A) = 2202.\nFIGURE 29-31 (a) A simple\n(half-wave) rectifier circuit using a\nsemiconductor diode.

The electric field across the junction becomes so large that\nionization of atoms results. The electrons thus pulled off their atoms contribute\nto a larger and larger current as breakdown continues. The voltage remains con-\nstant over a wide range of currents. This is shown on the far left in Fig. 29-30.\nThis property of diodes can be used to accurately regulate a voltage supply.\nA diode designed for this purpose is called a zener diode. When placed across\nthe output of an unregulated power supply, a zener diode can maintain the voltage\nat its own breakdown voltage as long as the supply voltage is always above this\npoint. Zener diodes can be obtained corresponding to voltages of a few volts to\nhundreds of volts.\nA diode is called a nonlinear device because the current is not proportional\nto the voltage. That is, a graph of current versus voltage (Fig. 29-30) is not a\nstraight line, as it is for a resistor (which ideally is linear).\n* Rectifiers\nInput\nvoltage\n1\nTime\nOutput\nvoltage\nVab\n(b)\nSince a pn junction diode allows current to flow only in one direction (as long\nas the voltage is not too high), it can serve as a rectifier-to change ac into dc.\nA simple rectifier circuit is shown in Fig. 29-31a. The ac source applies a voltage\nacross the diode alternately positive and negative. Only during half of each cycle\nwill a current pass through the diode; only then is there a current through the\nresistor R. Hence, a graph of the voltage Vab across R as a function of time looks\nlike the output voltage shown in Fig. 29-31b. This half-wave rectification is not\nexactly dc, but it is unidirectional. More useful is a full-wave rectifier circuit, which\nuses two diodes (or sometimes four) as shown in Fig. 29-32a (top of next page).\nAt any given instant, either one diode or the other will conduct current to the right.\n*At room temperature, the reverse current is a few pA in Si; but it increases rapidly with temperature,\nand may render a diode ineffective above 200°C.\n846 CHAPTER 29 Molecules and Solids\n", 'chapter_title': '* 29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals; Fermi Energy'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': "elle\n?\n9\nFIGURE 29-32 (a) Full-wave\nrectifier circuit (including a\ntransformer so the magnitude of the\nvoltage can be changed).

(The variation in output shown\nin Fig. 29-32c is called ripple voltage.)\nRectifier circuits are important because most line voltage in buildings is ac,\nand most electronic devices require a dc voltage for their operation. Hence, diodes\nare found in nearly all electronic devices including radios, TV sets, computers, and\nchargers for cell phones and other devices.\n* Photovoltaic Cells\nSolar cells, also called photovoltaic cells, are rather heavily doped pn junction\ndiodes used to convert sunlight into electric energy. Photons are absorbed, creating\nelectron-hole pairs if the photon energy is greater than the band gap energy, Eg\n(see Figs. 29-25c and 29-28). That is, the absorbed photon excites an electron\nfrom the valence band up to the conduction band, leaving behind a hole in the\nvalence band. The created electrons and holes produce a current that, when\nconnected to an external circuit, becomes a source of emf and power. A typical\nsilicon pn junction may produce about 0.6 V. Many are connected in series to\nproduce a higher voltage. Such series strings are connected in parallel within\na photovoltaic panel. Research includes experimenting with combinations of\nsemiconductors. A good photovoltaic panel can have an output of perhaps\n50 W/m2, averaged over day and night, sunny and cloudy. The world's total elec-\ntricity demand is on the order of 1012 w, which could be met with solar cells\ncovering an area of only about 200 km × 200 km of Earth's surface.+\nPhotodiodes (Section 27-3) and semiconductor particle detectors (Section 30-13)\noperate similarly.\n* LEDS\nA light-emitting diode (LED) is sort of the reverse of a photovoltaic cell. When a\npn junction is forward biased, a current begins to flow. Electrons cross from the\nn-region into the p-region, recombining with holes, and a photon can be emitted\nwith an energy about equal to the band gap energy, Eg . This does not work well with\nsilicon diodes .* But high light-emission is achieved with compound semiconductors,\ntypically involving a group III and a group V element such as gallium and arsenic\n(= gallium arsenide = GaAs). Remarkably, GaAs has a crystal structure very\nsimilar to Si. See Fig. 29-33. For doping of GaAs, group VI atoms (like Se) can\nserve as donors, and group II atoms (valence +2, such as Zn) as acceptors. The\nenergy gap for GaAs is Eg = 1.42 eV, corresponding to near-infrared photons\nwith wavelength 870 nm (almost visible). Such infrared LEDs are suitable for use in\nremote-control devices for TVs, DVD players, stereos, car door locks, and so on.\nThe first visible-light LED, developed in the early 1960s, was made of a semi-\nconductor compound of gallium, arsenic, and phosphorus (= GaAsP) which\nemitted red light. The red LED soon found use as the familiar indicator lights\n(on-off) on electronic devices, and as the bright red read-out on calculators and\n*Electricity makes up about 5% of total global energy use.\n*Electron-hole recombination in silicon results mostly in heat, as lattice vibrations called phonons.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nLEDs and applications\nCar safety (brakes)\nFIGURE 29-33 (a) Two Si atoms\nforming the covalent bond showing the\nelectrons in different colors for each of\nthe two separate atoms.

Further development\nled to LEDs with higher Eg and shorter wavelengths: first yellow, then finally in\n1995, blue (InGaN). A blue LED was important because it gave the possibility of\na white-light LED. White light can be approximated by LEDs in two ways:\n(1) using a red, a yellow-green, and a blue LED; (2) using a blue LED with\ncoatings of "powders" or "phosphors" that are fluorescent (Section 28-10). For\nthe latter, the high-energy blue LED photons are themselves emitted, plus they\ncan excite the various phosphors to excited states which decay in two or more\nsteps, emitting light of lower energy and longer wavelengths.

LED\nlights, sometimes called solid-state lighting, are longer-lived (50,000 hours vs.\n1000-2000 for ordinary bulbs), more efficient (up to 5 times), and rugged. A small\ntown in Italy, Torraca, was the first to have all its street lighting be LED (2007).\nLEDs can be as small as 1 or 2 mm wide, and are individual units with wires\nconnected directly to them. They can be used for large TV screens in stadiums, but\na home TV would require much smaller LED size, meaning fabrication of many\non a crystalline semiconductor, and the pixels would be addressed as discussed in\nSection 17-11 for LCD screens.\nFIGURE 29-36 A pulse oximeter.\n*\nPulse Oximeter\nA pulse oximeter uses two LEDs to measure the % oxygen (O2) saturation in\nyour blood. One LED is red, 660 nm, and the other IR (900-940 nm). The\nLED beams pass through a finger (Fig. 29-36) or earlobe and are detected by a\nphotodiode. Oxygenated red blood cells absorb less red and more infrared light\nthan deoxygenated cells. A ratio of absorbed light (red/IR) of 0.5 corresponds\nto nearly 100% O2 saturation; a ratio of 1.0 is about 85% and 2.0 corresponds to\nabout 50% (bad).

They emit photons like an LED but, like all lasers\n(Section 28-11), need to have an inverted population of states for the lasing frequency.\nThis is achieved by applying a high forward-bias voltage. The large current brings\nmany electrons into the conduction band at the junction layer, and holes into the\nvalence band, and before the electrons have time to combine with holes, they\nform an inverted population. When one electron drops down into a hole and\nemits a photon, that photon stimulates other electrons to drop down as well,\nin phase, creating coherent laser light. Opposite ends of the crystal are made\nparallel and very smooth so they act as the mirrors needed for lasing, as shown\nin our laser diagram, Fig. 28-18.\n848 CHAPTER 29\n', 'chapter_title': '* 29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals; Fermi Energy'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CH3\n120\nCH3\nFIGURE 29-37 These two organic\nmolecules were used in the first\nOLEDs (1987).

We usually think of them as coming from\nlife-plants and animals. They are also found in petroleum, and some can be\nsynthesized in the lab. Organic compounds can be complex, and often contain\nthe familiar hexagonal "benzene ring" with C atoms at all (or most) of the six\ncorners. The two organic compounds shown in Fig. 29-37 were used as n-type\nand p-type layers in the earliest useful OLED. Polymers, long organic molecules\nwith repeating structural units, can also be used for an OLED.\nThe simplest OLED consists of two organic layers, the emissive layer and the\nconductive layer, each 20 to 50 nm thick, sandwiched between two electrodes,\nFig. 29-38. The anode is typically transparent, to let the light out. It can be made\nof a very thin layer of indium-tin oxide (ITO), which is transparent and conduc-\ntive, coated on a glass slab.

They can\nbe more easily constructed as a unit for a screen display (i.e., more cheaply, but\nstill quite expensive) than for inorganic LEDs. Their use as screens on cell\nphones, cameras, and TVs produces brighter light and greater contrast, and they\nneed less power (important for battery life of portable devices) than LCD screens.\nWhy? They need no backlight (like LCDs) because they emit the light themselves.\nOLEDs can be fabricated as a matrix, usually active matrix (AMOLED), using\nthe same type of addressing described in Section 17-11 for LCDs. OLED displays\nare much thinner than LCDs and retain brightness at larger viewing angles. They\ncan even be fabricated on curved or flexible substrates-try the windshield of your\ncar (Fig. 29-39). The array may be RGBG (similar to a Bayer mosaic, Fig. 25-2)\nor RGBW where W = white is meant to give greater brightness. The subpixels\ncan also be stacked, one above the other (similar to the Foveon, Fig. 25-3).\nFIGURE 29-39 Head up displays\non curved windshields can use\ncurved OLEDs to show, for\nexample, your speed without having\nto look down at the speedometer.\n* OLED Functioning (advanced)\nAccording to band theory, when a voltage is applied (~ 2 to 5 V), electrons\nare "injected" (engineering term) into energy states of the lowest unoccupied\nmolecular orbitals (LUMO) of the emissive layer. At the same time, electrons\nare withdrawn from the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) of the\nconductive layer at the cathode-which is equivalent to holes being "injected"\ninto the conductive layer. The LUMO and HOMO energy levels are analogous\nto the conduction and valence bands of inorganic silicon diodes (Fig. 29-28).\nHoles travel in the HOMO, electrons in the LUMO.

Both npn and pnp transistors can\nbe made, and they are shown schematically in Fig. 29-40a. The three semicon-\nductors are given the names collector, base, and emitter.

Hence a transistor can amplify a small signal into a larger one.\nTypically a small ac signal (call it iB) is to be amplified, and when added to\nthe base bias current (and voltage) causes the current and voltage at the collector\nto vary at the same rate but magnified. Thus, what is important for amplification\nis the change in collector current for a given input change in base current. We label\nthese ac signal currents (= changes in Ic and IB) as ic and ig .

The collector voltage is negative, and so is the base voltage in normal operation.\nAnother kind of transistor, very important, is the MOSFET (metal-oxide\nsemiconductor field-effect transistor) common in digital circuits as a type of switch.\nIts construction is shown in Fig. 29-42a, and its symbol in Fig. 29-42b. What is\ncalled the emitter in a bipolar transistor is called the source in a MOSFET,\nand the collector is called the drain. The base is called the gate. The gate acts to\nlet a current flow, or not, from the source to the drain, depending on the electric\nfield it (the gate) provides across an insulator that separates it from the p-type\nsemiconductor below, Fig. 29-42a. Hence the name "field-effect transistor" (FET).+\nMOSFETs are often used like switches, on or off, which in digital circuits can\nallow the storage of a binary bit, a "1" or a "0".

Tiny amounts of impurities can be inserted or injected at particular loca-\ntions within a single silicon crystal or wafer. These can be arranged to form diodes,\ntransistors, resistors (undoped semiconductors), and very thin connecting "wires"\n(= conductors) which are heavily doped thin lines. Capacitors and inductors\ncan also be formed, but also can be connected separately. Integrated circuits are\nthe heart of computers, televisions, calculators, cameras, and the electronic\ninstruments that control aircraft, space vehicles, and automobiles.\nA tiny chip, a few millimeters on a side, may contain billions of transistors\nand other circuit elements. The number of elements/mm2 has been doubling every\n2 or 3 years. We often hear of the technology generation, which is a number that\nrefers to the minimum width of a conducting line ("wire"). The gate of a MOSFET\nmay be even smaller. Since 2003 we have passed from 90-nm technology to 65-nm,\nto 45-nm, to 32-nm, to 22-nm, every 2 to 3 years, and now 16-nm technology\nwhich-being only a few atoms wide-may involve new structures and quantum-\nmechanical effects. Smaller means more diodes and transistors per mm2 and\ntherefore greater speed (faster response time) because the distance signals have\nto travel is less. Smaller also means lower power consumption. Size, speed, and\npower have all been improved 10 to 100 million times in the last 40 years.\n*The "MOS" comes from a version with a Metal gate, silicon diOxide insulator, and a Semiconductor\n(p-type shown in Fig. 29-42a). The gate can also be heavily doped silicon (= good conductor).\n*SECTION 29-11 Integrated Circuits, 22-nm Technology 851\n', 'chapter_title': '* 29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals; Fermi Energy'}, {'page_number': 24, 'type': 'text', 'content': "*\nSummary\nQuantum mechanics explains the bonding together of atoms to\nform molecules. In a covalent bond, the atoms share electrons.\nThe electron clouds of two or more atoms overlap because of\nconstructive interference between the electron waves. The\npositive nuclei are attracted to this concentration of negative\ncharge between them, forming the bond.\nAn ionic bond is an extreme case of a covalent bond in\nwhich one or more electrons from one atom spend much more\ntime around the other atom than around their own. The atoms\nthen act as oppositely charged ions that attract each other,\nforming the bond.\nThese strong bonds hold molecules together, and also hold\natoms and molecules together in solids. Also important are\nweak bonds (or van der Waals bonds), which are generally dipole\nattractions between molecules.\nWhen atoms combine to form molecules, the energy levels\nof the outer electrons are altered because they now interact\nwith each other. Additional energy levels also become possible\nbecause the atoms can vibrate with respect to each other, and\nthe molecule as a whole can rotate. The energy levels for both\nvibrational and rotational motion are quantized, and are very\nclose together (typically, 10-1 eV to 10-3 eV apart). Each\natomic energy level thus becomes a set of closely spaced levels\ncorresponding to the vibrational and rotational motions. Tran-\nsitions from one level to another appear as many very closely\nspaced lines. The resulting spectra are called band spectra.\nThe quantized rotational energy levels are given by\nErot = (1 + 1)\n₭2\n2I\nl = 0, 1, 2, ··· , (29-1)\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the molecule.\n,\nThe energy levels for vibrational motion are given by\nEvib = (v + }) hf,\nv = 0, 1, 2, .. . ,\n(29-3)\nwhere f is the classical natural frequency of vibration for the\nmolecule. Transitions between energy levels are subject to the\nselection rules Al = +1 and Av = +1.\nSome solids are bound together by covalent and ionic bonds,\njust as molecules are. In metals, the electrostatic force between\nfree electrons and positive ions helps form the metallic bond.\nIn the free-electron theory of metals, electrons occupy the\npossible energy states according to the exclusion principle. At\nT = 0 K, all possible states are filled up to a maximum energy\nlevel called the Fermi energy, EF, the magnitude of which is\ntypically a few eV. All states above EF are vacant at T = 0K.\nQuestions\n1. What type of bond would you expect for (a) the N2 mole-\ncule, (b) the HCl molecule, (c) Fe atoms in a solid?\n2. Describe how the molecule CaCl2 could be formed.\n3. Does the H2 molecule have a permanent dipole moment?\nDoes O2 ? Does H2O? Explain.\n4. Although the molecule H3 is not stable, the ion H3+ is.\nExplain, using the Pauli exclusion principle.\n5. Would you expect the molecule H2+ to be stable? If so,\nwhere would the single electron spend most of its time?\n6. Explain why the carbon atom (Z = 6) usually forms four\nbonds with hydrogen-like atoms.\nIn a crystalline solid, the possible energy states for electrons\nare arranged in bands. Within each band the levels are very\nclose together, but between the bands there may be forbidden\nenergy gaps. Good conductors are characterized by the highest\noccupied band (the conduction band) being only partially full,\nso lots of states are available to electrons to move about and\naccelerate when a voltage is applied. In a good insulator, the\nhighest occupied energy band (the valence band) is completely\nfull, and there is a large energy gap (5 to 10 eV) to the next highest\nband, the conduction band. At room temperature, molecular\nkinetic energy (thermal energy) available due to collisions is only\nabout 0.04 e V, so almost no electrons can jump from the valence\nto the conduction band in an insulator. In a semiconductor, the\ngap between valence and conduction bands is much smaller,\non the order of 1 eV, so a few electrons can make the transition\nfrom the essentially full valence band to the nearly empty\nconduction band, allowing a small amount of conductivity.\nIn a doped semiconductor, a small percentage of impurity\natoms with five or three valence electrons replace a few of the\nnormal silicon atoms with their four valence electrons. A five-\nelectron impurity produces an n-type semiconductor with\nnegative electrons as carriers of current. A three-electron\nimpurity produces a p-type semiconductor in which positive\nholes carry the current. The energy level of impurity atoms lies\nslightly below the conduction band in an n-type semiconduc-\ntor, and acts as a donor from which electrons readily pass into\nthe conduction band. The energy level of impurity atoms in a\np-type semiconductor lies slightly above the valence band and\nacts as an acceptor level, since electrons from the valence band\neasily reach it, leaving holes behind to act as charge carriers.\nA semiconductor diode consists of a pn junction and allows\ncurrent to flow in one direction only; pn junction diodes are\nused as rectifiers to change ac to dc, as photovoltaic cells to\nproduce electricity from sunlight, and as lasers. Light-emitting\ndiodes (LED) use compound semiconductors which can emit\nlight when a forward-bias voltage is applied; uses include read-\nouts, infrared remote controls, visible lighting (flashlights,\nstreet lights), and very large TV screens. LEDs using organic\nmolecules or polymers (OLED) are used as screens on cell\nphones and other displays. Common transistors consist of three\nsemiconductor sections, either as pnp or npn. Transistors can\namplify electrical signals and in computers serve as switches or\ngates for the 1s and 0s of digital bits. An integrated circuit\nconsists of a tiny semiconductor crystal or chip on which many\ntransistors, diodes, resistors, and other circuit elements are\nconstructed by placement of impurities.\n7. The energy of a molecule can be divided into four categories.\nWhat are they?\n8. If conduction electrons are free to roam about in a metal,\nwhy don't they leave the metal entirely?\n9. Explain why the resistivity of metals increases with increas-\ning temperature whereas the resistivity of semiconductors\nmay decrease with increasing temperature.\n10. Compare the resistance of a pn junction diode connected\nin forward bias to its resistance when connected in reverse\nbias.\n11.

Assume conduction electrons in a semiconductor behave\nas an ideal gas. (This is not true for conduction electrons in\na metal.) (a) Taking mass m = 9 × 10-31 kg and temper-\nature T = 300 K, determine the de Broglie wavelength of\na semiconductor\'s conduction electrons. (b) Given that the\nspacing between atoms in a semiconductor\'s atomic lattice\nis on the order of 0.3 nm, would you expect room-temperature\nconduction electrons to travel in straight lines or diffract\nwhen traveling through this lattice? Explain.\n48. Consider a monatomic solid with a weakly bound cubic\nlattice, with each atom connected to six neighbors, each bond\nhaving a binding energy of 3.4 × 10-3 eV. When this solid\nmelts, its latent heat of fusion goes directly into breaking\nthe bonds between the atoms. Estimate the latent heat of\nfusion for this solid, in J/mol. [Hint: Show that in a simple\ncubic lattice (Fig. 29-44), there are three times as many bonds\nas there are atoms, when the number of atoms is large.]\nFIGURE 29-44\nProblem 48.\n4. A strip of silicon 1.6 cm wide and 1.0 mm thick is immersed\nin a magnetic field of strength 1.5 T perpendicular to the\nstrip (Fig. 29-45). When a current of 0.28 mA is run\nthrough the strip, there is a resulting Hall effect voltage of\n18 mV across the strip (Section 20-4).\nHow many electrons per silicon\natom are in the conduction band?\nB\nThe density of silicon is 2330 kg/m3.\nFIGURE 29-45\nSearch and Learn 4.\nI\n5. For an arsenic donor atom in a doped silicon semiconduc-\ntor, assume that the "extra" electron moves in a Bohr orbit\nabout the arsenic ion. For this electron in the ground state,\ntake into account the dielectric constant K = 12 of the\nSi lattice (which represents the weakening of the Coulomb\nforce due to all the other atoms or ions in the lattice), and\nestimate (a) the binding energy, and (b) the orbit radius\nfor this extra electron. [Hint: Substitute € = Keo in\nCoulomb\'s law; see Section 17-8 and also 27-12.]\nANSWERS TO EXERCISES\nA: 0; 5.00 × 10-4 eV; 1.50 × 10-3 eV.\nD: (c).\nB: 1.30 mm, 0.87 mm, 0.65 mm.\nE: (c), (e).\nC: 0.81 e V.\n856 CHAPTER 29 Molecules and Solids\n', 'chapter_title': '* 29-6 Free-Electron Theory of Metals;
