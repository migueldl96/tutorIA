Among the other quan-\ntities found to be conserved are linear momentum, angular momentum, and\nelectric charge. We will eventually discuss all of these because the conservation laws\nare among the most important ideas in science. In this Chapter we discuss linear\nmomentum and its conservation. The law of conservation of momentum is essen-\ntially a reworking of Newton\'s laws that gives us tremendous physical insight and\nproblem-solving power.\nThe law of conservation of momentum is particularly useful when dealing with\na system of two or more objects that interact with each other, such as in collisions\nof ordinary objects or nuclear particles.\nOur focus up to now has been mainly on the motion of a single object, often\nthought of as a "particle" in the sense that we have ignored any rotation or internal\nmotion. In this Chapter we will deal with systems of two or more objects, and-toward\nthe end of the Chapter-the concept of center of mass.\n', 'chapter_title': '7-1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': '7-1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force\nThe linear momentum (or "momentum" for short) of an object is defined as the\nproduct of its mass and its velocity. Momentum (plural is momenta-from Latin) is\nrepresented by the symbol p. If we let m represent the mass of an object and\nv represent its velocity, then its momentum p is defined as\np = mv.\n(7-1)\nVelocity is a vector, so momentum too is a vector. The direction of the momentum\nis the direction of the velocity, and the magnitude of the momentum is p = mv.\nBecause velocity depends on the reference frame, so does momentum; thus the ref-\nerence frame must be specified. The unit of momentum is that of mass X velocity,\nwhich in SI units is kg . m/s. There is no special name for this unit.\nEveryday usage of the term momentum is in accord with the definition above.\nAccording to Eq. 7-1, a fast-moving car has more momentum than a slow-moving\ncar of the same mass; a heavy truck has more momentum than a small car moving\nwith the same speed. The more momentum an object has, the harder it is to stop\nit, and the greater effect it will have on another object if it is brought to rest by\nstriking that object. A football player is more likely to be stunned if tackled by a\nheavy opponent running at top speed than by a lighter or slower-moving tackler.\nA heavy, fast-moving truck can do more damage than a slow-moving motorcycle.\n-\nEXERCISE A Can a small sports car ever have the same momentum as a large sport-\nutility vehicle with three times the sports car\'s mass? Explain.\nA force is required to change the momentum of an object, whether to\nincrease the momentum, to decrease it, or to change its direction. Newton origi-\nnally stated his second law in terms of momentum (although he called the product\nmv the "quantity of motion"). Newton\'s statement of the second law of motion,\ntranslated into modern language, is as follows:\nThe rate of change of momentum of an object is equal to the net force\napplied to it.\nNEWTON\'S SECOND LAW\nWe can write this as an equation,\nAp\nAt\n>F =\n(7-2)\nNEWTON\'S SECOND LAW\nwhere EF is the net force applied to the object (the vector sum of all forces acting\non it) and Ap is the resulting momentum change that occurs during the time\ninterval+ At.\nWe can readily derive the familiar form of the second law, EF = ma, from\nEq. 7-2 for the case of constant mass. If v1 is the initial velocity of an object and\nV2 is its velocity after a time interval At has elapsed, then\nAt\n2F = AP _ mv2 - mỹ1\n=\nm(v2 - V1)\n=\nAv\nm\nAt\n△t\nAt\nBy definition, a = Av/At, so\nCAUTION\nThe change in the momentum vector\nis in the direction of the net force\n¿F = mã.\n[constant mass]\nEquation 7-2 is a more general statement of Newton\'s second law than the more\nfamiliar version (2F = ma) because it includes the situation in which the mass\nmay change. A change in mass occurs in certain circumstances, such as for rockets\nwhich lose mass as they expel burnt fuel.\n+Normally we think of At as being a small time interval. If it is not small, then Eq. 7-2 is valid if EF\nis constant during that time interval, or if 2F is the average net force during that time interval.\nSECTION 7-1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force 171\n', 'chapter_title': '7-1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 7-1 |ESTIMATE\nForce of a tennis serve. For a top player, a ten-\nnis ball may leave the racket on the serve with a speed of 55 m/s (about\n120 mi/h), Fig. 7-1.

When the water hits the car, the water loses\nthis momentum (Pfinal = 0). We use Newton's second law in the momentum\nform, Eq. 7-2, to find the force that the car exerts on the water to stop it.\nBy Newton's third law, the force exerted by the water on the car is equal and\nopposite. We have a continuing process: 1.5 kg of water leaves the hose in\neach 1.0-s time interval. So let us write F = Ap/At where At = 1.0s, and\nMVinitial = (1.5 kg)(20 m/s) = 30 kg ·m/s.\nSOLUTION The force (assumed constant) that the car must exert to change\nthe momentum of the water is\nF =\n△t\n4p\n=\nPfinal - Pinitial\n=\n0 - 30 kg · m/s\n=\n-30 N.\nAt\n1.0 s\nThe minus sign indicates that the force exerted by the car on the water is oppo-\nsite to the water's original velocity.

The water is\nmoving to the right, so common sense tells us the force on the car must be to\nthe right.\n-\nEXERCISE B If the water splashes back from the car in Example 7-2, would the force\non the car be larger or smaller?\n172 CHAPTER 7 Linear Momentum\n", 'chapter_title': '7-1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': '7-2 Conservation of Momentum\nThe concept of momentum is particularly important because, if no net external\nforce acts on a system, the total momentum of the system is a conserved quantity.\nThis was expressed in Eq. 7-2 for a single object, but it holds also for a system as\nwe shall see.\nConsider the head-on collision of two billiard balls, as shown in Fig. 7-3.\nWe assume the net external force on this system of two balls is zero-that is,\nthe only significant forces during the collision are the forces that each ball\nexerts on the other. Although the momentum of each of the two balls changes\nas a result of the collision, the sum of their momenta is found to be the same\nbefore as after the collision. If mAVA is the momentum of ball A and mBVB\nthe momentum of ball B, both measured just before the collision, then the\ntotal momentum of the two balls before the collision is the vector sum\nMAVA + mBVB. Immediately after the collision, the balls each have a different\nvelocity and momentum, which we designate by a "prime" on the velocity:\nMA VA and mBVB.

During the collision, suppose that the force exerted by\nobject A on object B at any instant is F. Then, by Newton\'s third law, the force\nexerted by object B on object A is -F. During the brief collision time, we assume\nno other (external) forces are acting (or that F is much greater than any other\nexternal forces acting). Over a very short time interval At we have\nF =\nAt\nAPB\n=\nPB - PB\nAt\nand\nAt\n-F = APA PA - PA\n△t\nWe add these two equations together and find\n0 =\nДрв + Дра\n=\nAt\n(PB - PB) + (PA - PA)\n.\nAt\nThis means\nPB - PB + PA - PA = 0,\nor\nP\'A + PB = PA + PB .\nThis is Eq. 7-3. The total momentum is conserved.\nWe have put this derivation in the context of a collision. As long as no exter-\nnal forces act, it is valid over any time interval, and conservation of momentum is\nalways valid as long as no external forces act on the chosen system. In the real world,\nexternal forces do act: friction on billiard balls, gravity acting on a tennis ball, and so\non.

If the net force EF on the\nsystem is zero [as it was above for our two-object system, F + (-F) = 0], then\nfrom Eq. 7-2, Ap = >F At = 0, so the total momentum doesn\'t change. The\ngeneral statement of the law of conservation of momentum is\nLAW OF CONSERVATION\nOF MOMENTUM\nThe total momentum of an isolated system of objects remains constant.\nBy a system, we simply mean a set of objects that we choose, and which may\ninteract with each other. An isolated system is one in which the only (significant)\nforces are those between the objects in the system. The sum of all these "internal"\nforces within the system will be zero because of Newton\'s third law. If there are\nexternal forces-by which we mean forces exerted by objects outside the system-\nand they don\'t add up to zero, then the total momentum of the system won\'t be\nconserved. However, if the system can be redefined so as to include the other\nobjects exerting these forces, then the conservation of momentum principle can\napply. For example, if we take as our system a falling rock, it does not conserve\nmomentum because an external force, the force of gravity exerted by the Earth,\naccelerates the rock and changes its momentum. However, if we include the Earth in\nthe system, the total momentum of rock plus Earth is conserved. (This means that\nthe Earth comes up to meet the rock. But the Earth\'s mass is so great, its upward\nvelocity is very tiny.)\nAlthough the law of conservation of momentum follows from Newton\'s\nsecond law, as we have seen, it is in fact more general than Newton\'s laws. In the\ntiny world of the atom, Newton\'s laws fail, but the great conservation laws-\nthose of energy, momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge-have been\nfound to hold in every experimental situation tested. It is for this reason that\nthe conservation laws are considered more basic than Newton\'s laws.\nEXAMPLE 7-3\nRailroad cars collide: momentum conserved. A 10,000-kg\nrailroad car, A, traveling at a speed of 24.0 m/s strikes an identical car, B, at\nrest.

At what speed does the rowboat move away from the dock?\nThe law of conservation of momentum is particularly useful when we are\ndealing with fairly simple systems such as colliding objects and certain types of\n"explosions." For example, rocket propulsion, which we saw in Chapter 4 can be\nunderstood on the basis of action and reaction, can also be explained on the\nbasis of the conservation of momentum. We can consider the rocket plus its fuel as an\nisolated system if it is far out in space (no external forces). In the reference frame\nof the rocket before any fuel is ejected, the total momentum of rocket plus fuel\nis zero. When the fuel burns, the total momentum remains unchanged: the back-\nward momentum of the expelled gases is just balanced by the forward momentum\ngained by the rocket itself (see Fig. 7-6). Thus, a rocket can accelerate in empty\nspace. There is no need for the expelled gases to push against the Earth or the\nair (as is sometimes erroneously thought). Similar examples of (nearly) isolated\nsystems where momentum is conserved are the recoil of a gun when a bullet is fired\n(Example 7-5), and the movement of a rowboat just after a package is thrown from it.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 7-4\nFalling on or off a sled. (a) An empty sled\nis sliding on frictionless ice when Susan drops vertically from a tree down onto\nthe sled. When she lands, does the sled speed up, slow down, or keep the same\nspeed? (b) Later: Susan falls sideways off the sled. When she drops off, does\nthe sled speed up, slow down, or keep the same speed?\nRESPONSE (a) Because Susan falls vertically onto the sled, she has no initial\nhorizontal momentum. Thus the total horizontal momentum afterward equals the\nmomentum of the sled initially. Since the mass of the system (sled + person) has\nincreased, the speed must decrease.\n(b) At the instant Susan falls off, she is moving with the same horizontal speed\nas she was while on the sled. At the moment she leaves the sled, she has the\nsame momentum she had an instant before. Because her momentum does not\nchange, neither does the sled\'s (total momentum conserved); the sled keeps the\nsame speed.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nRocket propulsion\nCAUTION\nA rocket does not push on the Earth;\nit is propelled by pushing out the\ngases it burned as fuel\nFIGURE 7-6 (a) A rocket,\ncontaining fuel, at rest in some\nreference frame.

Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\n7-3 Collisions and Impulse\nCollisions are a common occurrence in everyday life: a tennis racket or a baseball\nbat striking a ball, billiard balls colliding, a hammer hitting a nail. When a collision\noccurs, the interaction between the objects involved is usually far stronger than\nany external forces. We can then ignore the effects of any other forces during the\nbrief time interval of the collision.\nDuring a collision of two ordinary objects, both objects are deformed, often\nconsiderably, because of the large forces involved (Fig. 7-8). When the collision\noccurs, the force each exerts on the other usually jumps from zero at the moment\nof contact to a very large force within a very short time, and then rapidly\nreturns to zero again. A graph of the magnitude of the force that one object\nexerts on the other during a collision, as a function of time, is something like\nthe red curve in Fig. 7-9. The time interval At is usually very distinct and very\nsmall, typically milliseconds for a macroscopic collision.\nFIGURE 7-9 Force as a function of time\nduring a typical collision.

This equa-\ntion applies to each of the two objects in a collision. We multiply both sides of this\nequation by the time interval At, and obtain\nF At = Ap.\n(7-4)\nThe quantity on the left, the product of the force F times the time At over which\nthe force acts, is called the impulse:\nImpulse = F At.\n(7-5)\nWe see that the total change in momentum is equal to the impulse. The concept\nof impulse is useful mainly when dealing with forces that act during a short time\ninterval, as when a bat hits a baseball. The force is generally not constant, and\noften its variation in time is like that graphed in Figs. 7-9 and 7-10. We can often\napproximate such a varying force as an average force F acting during a time\ninterval At, as indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 7-10.

The hand's\nspeed changes from 10 m/s to zero over a distance of perhaps one cm (roughly\nhow much your hand and the board compress before your hand comes to a\nstop, and the board begins to give way).

But by making use of the conservation laws for momentum and energy,\nwe can still determine a lot about the motion after a collision, given the motion\nbefore the collision. We saw in Section 7-2 that in the collision of two objects\nsuch as billiard balls, the total momentum is conserved.

The col-\nlision of two hard elastic balls, such as billiard balls, however, is very close to\nbeing perfectly elastic, and we often treat it as such.\nWe do need to remember that even when kinetic energy is not conserved,\nthe total energy is always conserved.\nCollisions in which kinetic energy is not conserved are said to be inelastic\ncollisions. The kinetic energy that is lost is changed into other forms of energy,\noften thermal energy, so that the total energy (as always) is conserved. In this case,\nKEA + KEB = KE\'A + KEB + thermal and other forms of energy.\nSee Fig. 7-12, and the details in its caption.\n7-5 Elastic Collisions in One Dimension\nWe now apply the conservation laws for momentum and kinetic energy to an elastic\ncollision between two small objects that collide head-on, so all the motion is along a\nline. To be general, we assume that the two objects are moving, and their velocities\nare VA and VB along the x axis before the collision, Fig. 7-13a. After the collision,\ntheir velocities are v\'A and v\'B , Fig. 7-13b. For any v > 0, the object is moving to the\nright (increasing x), whereas for v < 0, the object is moving to the left (toward\ndecreasing values of x).\nFrom conservation of momentum, we have\nMA VA + mBUB = MA V\'A + MB U\'B.\nB\n\'B\n(a)\nBecause the collision is assumed to be elastic, kinetic energy is also conserved:\n[MAU+/mBU =/mA0°+/mBUg.\ny\nmA\nmB\nx\nWe have two equations, so we can solve for two unknowns. If we know the masses\nand velocities before the collision, then we can solve these two equations for the\nvelocities after the collision, v\'A and v\'B . We derive a helpful result by rewriting the\nmomentum equation as\nB\nv\n′\nB\n′\nv\n(b)\nx\nand we rewrite the kinetic energy equation as\nMA(VA - V\'A) = MB(U\'B - UB),\n(i)\nmA(U2-02)= mB(v-v2).\nNoting that algebraically (a2 - b2) = (a - b)(a + b), we write this last equation as\nMA(VA - V\'A) (VA + V\'A) = MB(VB - VB) (VB + UB).\n(ii)\nWe divide Eq. (ii) by Eq. (i), and (assuming VA # v\'A and VB # VB)* obtain\nVA + V\'A = U\'B + UB .\n*Note that Eqs. (i) and (ii), which are the conservation laws for momentum and kinetic energy, are\nboth satisfied by the solution v\'A = VA and VB = VB . This is a valid solution, but not very interesting.\nIt corresponds to no collision at all-when the two objects miss each other.\n178 CHAPTER 7 Linear Momentum\n', 'chapter_title': '7-1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': "We can rewrite this equation as\nVA - UB = V'B - V'A\nor\nVA - UB = - (V'A - U'B).\n[head-on (1-D) elastic collision] (7-7)\nThis is an interesting result: it tells us that for any elastic head-on collision, the\nrelative speed of the two objects after the collision (v'A - v'B) has the same magnitude\n(but opposite direction) as before the collision, no matter what the masses are.\nEquation 7-7 was derived from conservation of kinetic energy for elastic\ncollisions, and can be used in place of it. Because the v's are not squared in\nEq. 7-7, it is simpler to use in calculations than the conservation of kinetic\nenergy equation (Eq. 7-6) directly.\nCAUTION\nRelative speeds (one dimension only)\nEXAMPLE 7-7\nEqual masses.

Assume (a) both balls are moving\ninitially (VA and UB), (b) ball B is initially at rest (VB = 0).\nAPPROACH There are two unknowns, v'A and vg, so we need two indepen-\ndent equations. We focus on the time interval from just before the collision\nuntil just after. No net external force acts on our system of two balls (mg and\nthe normal force cancel), so momentum is conserved. Conservation of kinetic\nenergy applies as well because we are told the collision is elastic.\nSOLUTION (a) The masses are equal (mA = mB = m) so conservation of\nmomentum gives\nVA + UB = V'A + U'B ·\nWe need a second equation, because there are two unknowns. We could use the\nconservation of kinetic energy equation, or the simpler Eq. 7-7 derived from it:\nVA - UB = V'B - V'A .\nWe add these two equations and obtain\nV'B = VA\nand then subtract the two equations to obtain\nV'A = UB .\nThat is, the balls exchange velocities as a result of the collision: ball B acquires\nthe velocity that ball A had before the collision, and vice versa.\n(b) If ball B is at rest initially, so that VB = 0, we have\nV'B = VA\nand\nv'A = 0.\nThat is, ball A is brought to rest by the collision, whereas ball B acquires the\noriginal velocity of ball A. See Fig. 7-14.\nNOTE Our result in part (b) is often observed by billiard and pool players, and\nis valid only if the two balls have equal masses (and no spin is given to the balls).\nFIGURE 7-14 In this multiflash photo of a head-on\ncollision between two balls of equal mass, the white\ncue ball is accelerated from rest by the cue stick and\nthen strikes the red ball, initially at rest. The white\nball stops in its tracks, and the (equal-mass) red ball\nmoves off with the same speed as the white ball had\nbefore the collision.

A proton (p) of mass 1.01 u (unified\natomic mass units) traveling with a speed of 3.60 × 104 m/s has an elastic\nhead-on collision with a helium (He) nucleus (mHe = 4.00 u) initially at rest.\nWhat are the velocities of the proton and helium nucleus after the collision?\n(As mentioned in Chapter 1, 1 u = 1.66 × 10-27 kg, but we won\'t need this\nfact.) Assume the collision takes place in nearly empty space.\nAPPROACH Like Example 7-7, this is an elastic head-on collision, but now the\nmasses of our two particles are not equal. The only external force could be\nEarth\'s gravity, but it is insignificant compared to the powerful forces between the\ntwo particles at the moment of collision. So again we use the conservation laws of\nmomentum and of kinetic energy, and apply them to our system of two particles.\nSOLUTION We use the subscripts p for the proton and He for the helium\nnucleus. We are given VHe = 0 and Vp = 3.60 × 104 m/s. We want to find the\nvelocities up and v\'He after the collision. From conservation of momentum,\nmp Up + 0 = mp up + mHe V\'He .\nBecause the collision is elastic, the kinetic energy of our system of two particles is\nconserved and we can use Eq. 7-7, which becomes\nThus\nUp - 0 = V\'He - Up.\nUp = THe - Up,\nand substituting this into our momentum equation displayed above, we get\nmp Up = mp UHe - mp Up + mHe V\'Не .\nSolving for v\'He , we obtain\n2mp Up\n=\n2(1.01 u)(3.60 × 104 m/s)\n= 1.45 × 104 m/s.\nV\'He =\nmp + mHe\n(4.00 u + 1.01 u)\nThe other unknown is vp, which we can now obtain from\nvp = V\'He - Vp = (1.45 × 104 m/s) - (3.60 × 104 m/s) = - 2.15 × 104 m/s.\nThe minus sign for vp tells us that the proton reverses direction upon collision,\nand we see that its speed is less than its initial speed (see Fig. 7-15).\nNOTE This result makes sense: the lighter proton would be expected to "bounce\nback" from the more massive helium nucleus, but not with its full original velocity\nas from a rigid wall (which corresponds to extremely large, or infinite, mass).\n7-6 Inelastic Collisions\nCollisions in which kinetic energy is not conserved are called inelastic collisions.\nSome of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into other types of energy, such\nas thermal or potential energy, so the total kinetic energy after the collision is less\nthan the total kinetic energy before the collision. The inverse can also happen\nwhen potential energy (such as chemical or nuclear) is released, in which case the\ntotal kinetic energy after the interaction can be greater than the initial kinetic\nenergy. Explosions are examples of this type.\nTypical macroscopic collisions are inelastic, at least to some extent, and often to\na large extent. If two objects stick together as a result of a collision, the collision\nis said to be completely inelastic. Two colliding balls of putty that stick together\nor two railroad cars that couple together when they collide are examples of com-\npletely inelastic collisions. The kinetic energy in some cases is all transformed to\nother forms of energy in an inelastic collision, but in other cases only part of it is.\nIn Example 7-3, for instance, we saw that when a traveling railroad car collided\nwith a stationary one, the coupled cars traveled off with some kinetic energy. In a\ncompletely inelastic collision, the maximum amount of kinetic energy is transformed\nto other forms consistent with conservation of momentum. Even though kinetic\nenergy is not conserved in inelastic collisions, the total energy is always conserved,\nand the total vector momentum is also conserved.\n180 CHAPTER 7\n', 'chapter_title': '7-1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 7-9\nBallistic pendulum. The ballistic pendulum is a device used\nto measure the speed of a projectile, such as a bullet. The projectile, of mass m,\nis fired into a large block (of wood or other material) of mass M, which is\nsuspended like a pendulum. (Usually, M is somewhat greater than m.) As a result\nof the collision, the pendulum and projectile together swing up to a maximum\nheight h, Fig. 7-16. Determine the relationship between the initial horizontal\nspeed of the projectile, v, and the maximum height h.\nAPPROACH We can analyze the process by dividing it into two parts or two\ntime intervals: (1) the time interval from just before to just after the collision\nitself, and (2) the subsequent time interval in which the pendulum moves from\nthe vertical hanging position to the maximum height h.\nIn part (1), Fig. 7-16a, we assume the collision time is very short, so that the\nprojectile is embedded in the block before the block has moved significantly from its\nrest position directly below its support. Thus there is effectively no net external force,\nand we can apply conservation of momentum to this completely inelastic collision.\nIn part (2), Fig. 7-16b, the pendulum begins to move, subject to a net\nexternal force (gravity, tending to pull it back to the vertical position); so for\npart (2), we cannot use conservation of momentum. But we can use conservation\nof mechanical energy because gravity is a conservative force (Chapter 6). The\nkinetic energy immediately after the collision is changed entirely to gravitational\npotential energy when the pendulum reaches its maximum height, h.\nSOLUTION In part (1) momentum is conserved:\ntotal p before = total p after\nmv = (m + M)v',\n(i)\nwhere v' is the speed of the block and embedded projectile just after the colli-\nsion, before they have moved significantly.\nIn part (2), mechanical energy is conserved. We choose y = 0 when the\npendulum hangs vertically, and then y = h when the pendulum-projectile\nsystem reaches its maximum height.

Start a problem\nby asking yourself whether the conservation laws apply in the given situation.\nHere, we determined that momentum is conserved only during the brief colli-\nsion, which we called part (1). But in part (1), because the collision is inelastic, the\nconservation of mechanical energy is not valid. Then in part (2), conservation\nof mechanical energy is valid, but not conservation of momentum.\nNote, however, that if there had been significant motion of the pendulum\nduring the deceleration of the projectile in the block, then there would have\nbeen an external force (gravity) during the collision, so conservation of momen-\ntum would not have been valid in part (1).\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nUse the conservation laws to\nanalyze a problem\nSECTION 7-6 Inelastic Collisions 181\n", 'chapter_title': '7-1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 7-10\nRailroad cars again.

By subtracting the total kinetic energy after the\ncollision from the total initial kinetic energy, we can find how much energy is\ntransformed to other types of energy.\nSOLUTION Before the collision, only car A is moving, so the total initial\nkinetic energy is 2mA v2 = 2 (10,000 kg)(24.0 m/s)2 = 2.88 × 106 J. After the\ncollision, both cars are moving with half the speed, v\' = 12.0 m/s, by conserva-\ntion of momentum (Example 7-3).

Check your work, check the units, and ask yourself\nwhether the results are reasonable.\n(a)\n1\n7-8 Center of Mass (CM)\nMomentum is a powerful concept not only for analyzing collisions but also for\nanalyzing the translational motion of real extended objects. Until now, when-\never we have dealt with the motion of an extended object (that is, an object that\nhas size), we have assumed that it could be approximated as a point particle or\nthat it undergoes only translational motion. Real extended objects, however, can\nundergo rotational and other types of motion as well. For example, the diver\nin Fig. 7-20a undergoes only translational motion (all parts of the object follow\nthe same path), whereas the diver in Fig. 7-20b undergoes both translational\nand rotational motion. We will refer to motion that is not pure translation as\ngeneral motion.\nObservations indicate that even if an object rotates, or several parts of a\nsystem of objects move relative to one another, there is one point that moves in\nthe same path that a particle would move if subjected to the same net force.\nThis point is called the center of mass (abbreviated CM). The general motion of\nan extended object (or system of objects) can be considered as the sum of the\ntranslational motion of the CM, plus rotational, vibrational, or other types of motion\nabout the CM.\nAs an example, consider the motion of the center of mass of the diver in\nFig. 7-20; the CM follows a parabolic path even when the diver rotates, as shown\nin Fig. 7-20b. This is the same parabolic path that a projected particle follows\nwhen acted on only by the force of gravity (projectile motion, Chapter 3).\nOther points in the rotating diver\'s body, such as her feet or head, follow more\ncomplicated paths.\n(b)\nFIGURE 7-20 The motion of the diver is pure translation\nin (a), but is translation plus rotation in (b).

Is the physical location of the CM the same?\nNote that the coordinates of the CM depend on the reference frame or coordinate\nsystem chosen. But the physical location of the CM is independent of that choice.\nIf the particles are spread out in two or three dimensions, then we must specify\nnot only the x coordinate of the CM (XCM), but also the y and z coordinates, which will\nbe given by formulas like Eq. 7-9a. For example, the y coordinate of the CM will be\nУсм =\nMAYA + MB YB + ...\n=\nMAYA + mBYB + ...\nM\n(7-9b)\nMA + MB + ...\nwhere M is the total mass of all the particles.\nx\n0\n1.0 m\n5.0 m 6.0 m\nX\nSECTION 7-8 Center of Mass (CM) 185\n', 'chapter_title': '7-1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Pivot point\nCG\nmỹ\nFIGURE 7-24 The force of gravity,\nconsidered to act at the CG, causes\nthis object to rotate about the pivot\npoint; if the CG were on a vertical\nline directly below the pivot, the\nobject would remain at rest.\nFIGURE 7-25 Finding the CG.\nCG!\nA concept similar to center of mass is center of gravity (CG). An object\'s CG is\nthat point at which the force of gravity can be considered to act. The force of gravity\nactually acts on all the different parts or particles of an object, but for purposes of\ndetermining the translational motion of an object as a whole, we can assume that\nthe entire weight of the object (which is the sum of the weights of all its parts) acts\nat the CG. There is a conceptual difference between the center of gravity and the\ncenter of mass, but for nearly all practical purposes, they are at the same point.+\nIt is often easier to determine the CM or CG of an extended object experimen-\ntally rather than analytically. If an object is suspended from any point, it will swing\n(Fig. 7-24) due to the force of gravity on it, unless it is placed so its CG lies on\na vertical line directly below the point from which it is suspended. If the object is\ntwo dimensional, or has a plane of symmetry, it need only be hung from two\ndifferent pivot points and the respective vertical (plumb) lines drawn. Then the\ncenter of gravity will be at the intersection of the two lines, as in Fig. 7-25. If\nthe object doesn\'t have a plane of symmetry, the CG with respect to the third dimen-\nsion is found by suspending the object from at least three points whose plumb\nlines do not lie in the same plane.\nFor symmetrically shaped objects such as uniform cylinders (wheels), spheres,\nand rectangular solids, the CM is located at the geometric center of the object.\nTo locate the center of mass of a group of extended objects, we can use\nEqs. 7-9, where the m\'s are the masses of these objects and the x\'s, y\'s, and z\'s\nare the coordinates of the CM of each of the objects.\n*\n7-9 CM for the Human Body\nFor a group of extended objects, each of whose CM is known, we can find the\nCM of the group using Eqs. 7-9a and b. As an example, we consider the human\nbody. Table 7-1 indicates the CM and hinge points (joints) for the different compo-\nnents of a "representative" person. Of course, there are wide variations among\npeople, so these data represent only a very rough average. The numbers represent\na percentage of the total height, which is regarded as 100 units; similarly, the total\nmass is 100 units. For example, if a person is 1.70 m tall, his or her shoulder joint\nwould be (1.70 m)(81.2/100) = 1.38 m above the floor.\nTABLE 7-1 Center of Mass of Parts of Typical Human Body, given as %\n(full height and mass = 100 units)\nDistance of Hinge\nPoints from Floor (%)\nHinge Points (.)\n(Joints)\nCenter of Mass (x)\n(% Height Above Floor)\nPercent\nMass\n91.2%\nBase of skull on spine\nHead\n93.5%\n6.9%\nShoulder joint\nTrunk and neck\n71.1%\n46.1%\n81.2%\nelbow 62.2%*\nX\nUpper arms\n71.7%\n6.6%\nwrist 46.2%*\nX\nLower arms\n55.3%\n4.2%\n52.1%\nHip joint\nHands\n43.1%\n1.7%\nUpper legs (thighs)\n42.5%\n21.5%\n28.5%\nKnee joint\nLower legs\n18.2%\n9.6%\n4.0%\nAnkle joint\nFeet\n1.8%\n3.4%\nBody CM = 58.0%\n100.0%\n* For arm hanging vertically.\n*There would be a difference between the CM and CG only in the unusual case of an object so large\nthat the acceleration due to gravity, g, was different at different parts of the object.\n186 CHAPTER 7 Linear Momentum\n', 'chapter_title': '7-1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': "EXAMPLE 7-13\nA leg's CM. Determine the position of the CM of a whole leg\n(a) when stretched out, and (b) when bent at 90°. See Fig. 7-26. Assume the\nperson is 1.70 m tall.\nAPPROACH Our system consists of three objects: upper leg, lower leg, and foot.\nThe location of the CM of each object, as well as the mass of each, is given in\nTable 7-1, where they are expressed in percentage units. To express the results\nin meters, these percentage values need to be multiplied by (1.70 m/100).\nWhen the leg is stretched out, the problem is one dimensional and we can\nsolve for the x coordinate of the CM. When the leg is bent, the problem is two\ndimensional and we need to find both the x and y coordinates.\nSOLUTION (a) We determine the distances from the hip joint using Table 7-1\nand obtain the numbers (%) shown in Fig. 7-26a. Using Eq. 7-9a, we obtain\n(ul = upper leg, etc.)\nXCM\nmul + mee + mf\nmuskul + meexee + mf xf\n21.5 + 9.6 + 3.4\n(21.5)(9.6) + (9.6)(33.9) + (3.4)(50.3)\n= 20.4 units.\n=\nThus, the center of mass of the leg and foot is 20.4 units from the hip joint, or\n52.1 - 20.4 = 31.7 units from the base of the foot. Since the person is 1.70 m\ntall, this is (1.70 m)(31.7/100) = 0.54 m above the bottom of the foot.\n(b) We use an xy coordinate system, as shown in Fig. 7-26b. First, we calculate\nhow far to the right of the hip joint the CM lies, accounting for all three parts:\nXCM\n21.5 + 9.6 + 3.4\n(21.5)(9.6) + (9.6)(23.6) + (3.4)(23.6)\n= 14.9 units.\nFor our 1.70-m-tall person, this is (1.70 m)(14.9/100) = 0.25 m from the hip joint.\nNext, we calculate the distance, ycm, of the CM above the floor:\nУсм\n3.4 + 9.6 + 21.5\n(3.4)(1.8) + (9.6)(18.2) + (21.5)(28.5)\n=\n23.0 units,\nor (1.70 m)(23.0/100) = 0.39 m. Thus, the CM is located 39 cm above the floor\nand 25 cm to the right of the hip joint.\nNOTE The CM lies outside the body in (b).\nKnowing the CM of the body when it is in various positions is of great use in\nstudying body mechanics. One simple example from athletics is shown in Fig. 7-27.\nIf high jumpers can get into the position shown, their CM can pass below the\nbar which their bodies go over, meaning that for a particular takeoff speed, they\ncan clear a higher bar. This is indeed what they try to do.\n*7-10 CM and Translational Motion\nAs mentioned in Section 7-8, a major reason for the importance of the concept\nof center of mass is that the motion of the CM for a system of particles (or an\nextended object) is directly related to the net force acting on the system as a\nwhole. We now show this, taking the simple case of one-dimensional motion\n(x direction) and only three particles, but the extension to more objects and to\nthree dimensions follows the same reasoning.\n-50.3\n-\n33.9\n+9.6+\n×\n(a)\n×\n×\n23.6-\n+9.6+\n×\n28.5\nx\n18.2\ny\n(b)\nx\n-\nx\n1.8\nFIGURE 7-26 Example 7-13:\nfinding the CM of a leg in two\ndifferent positions using percentages\nfrom Table 7-1.

From Eq. 7-9a for the center of mass, we can write\nMXCM = MAXA + MBXB + mcxc,\nwhere M = mA + mp + mc is the total mass of the system. If these particles\nare in motion (say, along the x axis with velocities VA , VB , and vc, respectively),\nthen in a short time interval At each particle and the CM will have traveled a dis-\ntance Ax = vAt, so that\nMUCM At = MA VA At + mB VB At + mc vc At.\nWe cancel At and get\nMUCH = MA VA + mB UB + mc vc.\n(7-10)\nSince MA VA + MB VB + mcvc is the sum of the momenta of the particles\nof the system, it represents the total momentum of the system. Thus we see from\nEq. 7-10 that the total (linear) momentum of a system of particles is equal to the\nproduct of the total mass M and the velocity of the center of mass of the system.\nOr, the linear momentum of an extended object is the product of the object's mass\nand the velocity of its CM.\nIf forces are acting on the particles, then the particles may be accelerating. In\na short time interval At, each particle's velocity will change by an amount Av = a At.\nIf we use the same reasoning as we did to obtain Eq. 7-10, we find\nNEWTON'S SECOND LAW\n(for a system)\nMaCM = MACA + mBaB + mcac.\nAccording to Newton's second law, MA @A = FA, mBaB = FB, and mcac = Fc,\nwhere FA, FB, and Fc are the net forces on the three particles, respectively. Thus\nwe get for the system as a whole MacM = FA + FB + Fc, or\nMacM = Fnet .\n(7-11)\nThat is, the sum of all the forces acting on the system is equal to the total mass of\nthe system times the acceleration of its center of mass. This is Newton's second\nlaw for a system of particles. It also applies to an extended object (which can be\nthought of as a collection of particles). Thus the center of mass of a system of\nparticles (or of an object) with total mass M moves as if all its mass were concen-\ntrated at the center of mass and all the external forces acted at that point. We can\nthus treat the translational motion of any object or system of objects as the\nmotion of a particle (see Figs. 7-20 and 7-21). This result simplifies our analysis\nof the motion of complex systems and extended objects. Although the motion of\nvarious parts of the system may be complicated, we may often be satisfied with\nknowing the motion of the center of mass. This result also allows us to solve\ncertain types of problems very easily, as illustrated by the following Example.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 7-14\nA two-stage rocket.

How does the boat move, as seen from the shore?\nAn interesting application is the discovery of nearby stars (see Section 5-8)\nthat seem to "wobble." What could cause such a wobble? It could be that a planet\norbits the star, and each exerts a gravitational force on the other. The planets are\ntoo small and too far away to be observed directly by telescopes. But the slight\nwobble in the motion of the star suggests that both the planet and the star (its sun)\norbit about their mutual center of mass, and hence the star appears to have a wobble.\nIrregularities in the star\'s motion can be measured to high accuracy, yielding\ninformation on the size of the planets\' orbits and their masses.

This is the law of\nconservation of momentum. Stated another way, the total\nmomentum of an isolated system of objects remains constant.\nThe law of conservation of momentum is very useful in\ndealing with collisions. In a collision, two (or more) objects\ninteract with each other over a very short time interval, and the\nforce each exerts on the other during this time interval is very\nlarge compared to any other forces acting.\nThe impulse delivered by a force on an object is defined as\nImpulse = F At,\n(7-5)\nwhere F is the average force acting during the (usually very\nshort) time interval At. The impulse is equal to the change in\nmomentum of the object:\nfor this two-object system.\nTotal energy is also conserved. But this may not be helpful\nunless kinetic energy is conserved, in which case the collision is\ncalled an elastic collision and we can write\n1\n2\n2\n1\n=\n.\n(7-6)\nIf kinetic energy is not conserved, the collision is called\ninelastic. Macroscopic collisions are generally inelastic.\nA completely inelastic collision is one in which the colliding\nobjects stick together after the collision.\nThe center of mass (CM) of an extended object (or group of\nobjects) is that point at which the net force can be considered\nto act, for purposes of determining the translational motion of\nthe object as a whole.

Figure 7-45 shows the\nplanet Saturn moving in the negative x direction at its\norbital speed (with respect to the Sun) of 9.6 km/s. The\nmass of Saturn is 5.69 × 1026 kg. A spacecraft with mass\n825 kg approaches Saturn. When far from Saturn, it moves\nin the +x direction at 10.4 km/s. The gravitational attrac-\ntion of Saturn (a conservative force) acting on the spacecraft\ncauses it to swing around the planet (orbit shown as dashed\nline) and head off in the opposite direction. Estimate the\nfinal speed of the spacecraft after it is far enough away to\nbe considered free of Saturn\'s gravitational pull.\nUsp= 10.4 km/s\nx\n-\nSaturn = - 9.6 km/s\n\'sp = ?\nMA + MB\nIVA.\nFIGURE 7-45\nSearch and Learn 4.\nANSWERS TO EXERCISES\nA: Yes, if the sports car\'s speed is three times greater.\nE: (b); (d).\nB: Larger (Ap is greater).\nF: The curve would be wider and less high.\nC: (a) 6.0 m/s; (b) almost zero; (c) almost 24.0 m/s.\nG: XCM = - 2.0 m; yes.\nD: 0.50 m/s.\nH: The boat moves in the opposite direction.\nSearch and Learn 197\n', 'chapter_title': '7-1 Momentum and Its Relation to Force'}, {'type': 'table', 'content': [{'row_index': 0, 'column_index': 0, 'content': 'TABLE 7-1 Center of Mass of Parts of Typical Human Body, given as % (full height and mass = 100 units)'}, {'row_index': 1, 'column_index': 0, 'content': 'Distance of Hinge Points from Floor (%)'}, {'row_index': 1, 'column_index': 1, 'content': 'Hinge Points (.)
