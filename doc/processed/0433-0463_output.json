To distinguish them, heat is defined as a transfer of energy due\nto a difference in temperature, whereas work is a transfer of energy that is not due\nto a temperature difference.\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'In discussing thermodynamics, we often refer to particular systems. A system\nis any object or set of objects that we wish to consider (see Section 14-4). Every-\nthing else in the universe is referred to as its "environment" or the "surroundings."\nIn this Chapter, we examine the two great laws of thermodynamics. The first\nlaw of thermodynamics relates work and heat transfers to the change in internal\nenergy of a system, and is a general statement of the conservation of energy. The\nsecond law of thermodynamics expresses limits on the ability to do useful work,\nand is often stated in terms of entropy, which is a measure of disorder. Besides\nthese two great laws, we also discuss some important related practical devices:\nheat engines, refrigerators, heat pumps, and air conditioners.\n15-1 The First Law of Thermodynamics\nIn Section 14-2, we defined the internal energy of a system as the sum total of all\nthe energy of the molecules within the system. Then the internal energy of a\nsystem should increase if work is done on the system, or if heat is added to it.\nSimilarly the internal energy should decrease if heat flows out of the system or if\nwork is done by the system on something in the surroundings.\nThus it is reasonable to extend conservation of energy and propose an impor-\ntant law: the change in internal energy of a closed system, AU, will be equal to\nthe energy added to the system by heating minus the work done by the system on\nthe surroundings. In equation form we write\nAU = Q - W\n(15-1)\nwhere Q is the net heat added to the system and W is the net work done by the system.\nWe must be careful and consistent in following the sign conventions for Q and W.\nBecause W in Eq. 15-1 is the work done by the system, then if work is done on the\nsystem, W will be negative and U will increase. Similarly, Q is positive for heat\nadded to the system, so if heat leaves the system, Q is negative. [Caution: Elsewhere\nyou may sometimes encounter the opposite convention for W where W is defined\nas the work done on the system; in that case Eq. 15-1 is written as AU = Q + W.]\nEquation 15-1 is known as the first law of thermodynamics. It is one of the\ngreat laws of physics, and its validity rests on experiments (such as Joule\'s) to\nwhich no exceptions have been seen. Since Q and W represent energy transferred\ninto or out of the system, the internal energy changes accordingly. Thus, the first\nlaw of thermodynamics is a general statement of the law of conservation of energy.\nNote that the conservation of energy law was not able to be formulated until\nthe 1800s, because it depended on the interpretation of heat as a transfer of energy.\nA given system does not "have" a certain amount of heat or work. Rather, work\nand heat are involved in thermodynamic processes that can change the system\nfrom one state to another; they are not characteristic of the state itself. Quantities\nwhich describe the state of a system, such as internal energy U, pressure P, volume V,\ntemperature T, and mass m or number of moles n, are called state variables.\nQ and W are not state variables.\nFIRST LAW OF\nTHERMODYNAMICS\n!\nCAUTION\nHeat added is +\nHeat lost is -\nWork on system is -\nWork by system is +\nCAUTION\nP, V, T, U, m, n are state\nvariables.

What is the change in internal energy\nof the system?\nAPPROACH We apply the first law of thermodynamics, Eq. 15-1, to our system.\nSOLUTION The heat added to the system is Q = 2500 J. The work W done\nby the system is -1800 J. Why the minus sign? Because 1800 J done on the\nsystem (as given) equals -1800 J done by the system, and it is the latter we need\nfor the sign conventions we used for Eq. 15-1. Hence\nAU = 2500J - (-1800J) = 2500 J + 1800 J = 4300 J.\nNOTE We did this calculation in detail to emphasize the importance of keeping\ncareful track of signs. Both the heat and the work are inputs to the system, so we\nexpect AU to be increased by both.\nSECTION 15-1 413\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Ideal gas\nMovable\npiston\nFIGURE 15-1 An ideal gas in a\ncylinder fitted with a movable piston.\nFIGURE 15-2 PV diagram for an\nideal gas undergoing isothermal\nprocesses at two different temperatures.\nEXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of\nheat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?\n*The First Law of Thermodynamics Extended\nTo write the first law of thermodynamics in a more complete form, consider a\nsystem that is moving so it has kinetic energy KE, and suppose there is also potential\nenergy PE.

Where did the bullet\'s lost KE go, and how much energy was transferred?\nAPPROACH Take the bullet and tree as our system. No potential energy is\ninvolved. No work is done on (or by) the system by outside forces, nor is any\nheat added because no energy was transferred to or from the system due to a\ntemperature difference. Thus the kinetic energy gets transformed into internal\nenergy of the bullet and tree. This answers the first question.\nSOLUTION In the first law of thermodynamics as written in Eq. 15-2, we are\ngiven Q = W = APE = 0, so we have\nAKE + AU = 0\nor, using subscripts i and f for initial and final velocities,\nAU = - AKE = - (KEf - KE;) = 2m(v? - v})\n= 1(3.0 × 10-3 kg)[(400 m/s)2 - (200m/s)2] = 180 J.\nNOTE The internal energy of the bullet and tree both increase, as both experi-\nence a rise in temperature. If we had chosen the bullet alone as our system, work\nwould be done on it and heat transfer would occur.\n15-2 Thermodynamic Processes and\nthe First Law\nLet us analyze some thermodynamic processes in light of the first law of\nthermodynamics.\nIsothermal Processes (AT = 0)\nTo begin, we choose a very simple system: a fixed mass of an ideal gas enclosed in\na container fitted with a movable piston as shown in Fig. 15-1.\n0\nFirst we consider an idealized process, such as adding heat or doing work, that is\ncarried out at constant temperature. Such a process is called an isothermal process\n(from the Greek meaning "same temperature"). If the system is an ideal gas, then\nPV = nRT (Eq. 13-3), so for a fixed amount of gas kept at constant temperature,\nPV = constant. Thus a graph of pressure P vs. volume V, a PV diagram, would\nfollow a curve like AB in Fig. 15-2 for an isothermal process. Each point on the\ncurve, such as point A, represents the state of the system at a given moment-\nthat is, its pressure P and volume V. At a lower temperature, another isothermal\nprocess would be represented by a curve like A\' B\' in Fig. 15-2 (the product\nPV = nRT = constant is less when T is less). The curves shown in Fig. 15-2\nare referred to as isotherms.\nP\nA\nA\'\nB\nHigher T\nB\'\nLower T\nV\nWe assume the gas is in contact with a heat reservoir (a body whose mass is so\nlarge that, ideally, its temperature does not change significantly when heat is exchanged\nwith our system). We also assume that a process of compression (volume decrease)\nor expansion (volume increase) is done very slowly, so that the process can be\nconsidered a series of equilibrium states all at the same constant temperature.+\n*If a gas expands or is compressed quickly, there is turbulence and different parts of the gas in its\ncontainer would be at different pressures and temperatures.\n414 CHAPTER 15 The Laws of Thermodynamics\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'If the gas is initially in a state represented by point A in Fig. 15-2, and an amount\nof heat Q is added to the system, the pressure and volume will change and\nthe state of the system will be represented by another point, B, on the diagram.\nIf the temperature is to remain constant, the gas will expand and do an amount\nof work W on the environment (it exerts a force on the piston in Fig. 15-1\nand moves it through a distance). The temperature and mass are kept constant\nso, from Eq. 14-1, the internal energy does not change: AU = 2nR AT = 0.\nHence, by the first law of thermodynamics, Eq. 15-1, AU = Q - W = 0, so\nW = Q: the work done by the gas in an isothermal process equals the heat added\nto the gas.\nAdiabatic Processes (Q = 0)\nAn adiabatic process is one in which no heat is allowed to flow into or out of the\nsystem: Q = 0. This situation can occur if the system is extremely well insulated,\nor the process happens so quickly that heat-which flows slowly-has no time\nto flow in or out. The very rapid expansion of gases in an internal combustion\nengine is one example of a process that is very nearly adiabatic. An adiabatic\nexpansion of an ideal gas done very slowly can be represented by a curve like\nthat labeled AC in Fig. 15-3. Since Q = 0, we have from Eq. 15-1 that\nAU = - W. When a gas expands, it does work and W is positive, so the inter-\nnal energy decreases; hence the temperature decreases as well (because\nAU = 2nR AT). This is seen in Fig. 15-3 where the product PV (= nRT) is less\nat point C than at point B. (Compare to curve AB for an isothermal process, in\nwhich AU = 0 and AT = 0.) In the reverse operation, an adiabatic compression\n(going from C to A, for example), work is done on the gas, and hence the internal\nenergy increases and the temperature rises. In a diesel engine, the fuel-air mixture\nis rapidly compressed adiabatically by a factor of 15 or more; the temperature\nrise is so great that the mixture ignites spontaneously, without spark plugs.\nP\nA\nIsothermal\nAdiabatic\n· B\n· C\n0\nV\nFIGURE 15-3 PV diagram for\nadiabatic (AC) and isothermal (AB)\nprocesses on an ideal gas.\nIsobaric and Isovolumetric Processes\nIsothermal and adiabatic processes are just two possible processes that can occur.\nTwo other simple thermodynamic processes are illustrated on the PV diagrams\nof Fig. 15-4: (a) an isobaric process is one in which the pressure is kept constant,\nso the process is represented by a straight horizontal line on the PV diagram\n(Fig. 15-4a); (b) an isovolumetric (or isochoric) process is one in which the volume\ndoes not change (Fig. 15-4b). In these, and in all other processes, the first law of\nthermodynamics holds.\nFIGURE 15-4 (a) Isobaric ("same\npressure") process. (b) Isovolumetric\n("same volume") process.\nWork Done in Volume Changes\nIt is often valuable to calculate the work done in a process. If the pressure is kept\nconstant during a process (isobaric), the work done is easily calculated. For exam-\nple, if the gas in Fig. 15-5 expands very slowly against the piston, the work done\nby the gas to raise the piston is the force F times the distance d. But the force\nis just the pressure P of the gas times the area A of the piston, F = PA.

Equation 15-3 is also valid for liquids and solids,\nas long as the pressure is constant during the process.\nP\nIn an isovolumetric process (Fig. 15-4b) the volume does not change, so no\nwork is done, W = 0.\nSECTION 15-2 Thermodynamic Processes and the First Law 415\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'P\nPA\nA\nIsovolumetric\nPB\nIsothermal\nB\nD Isobaric\nI\n1\n0\nVA\nVB\nFigure 15-6 shows the isotherm AB we saw in Fig. 15-2 as well as another\npossible process represented by the path ADB.

A rough estimate can be obtained, however, by using an "average" value\nfor P in Eq. 15-3. More accurately, the work done is equal to the area under the\nPV curve. This is obvious when the pressure is constant: as Fig. 15-7a shows, the\nshaded area is just PB(VB - VA), and this is the work done. Similarly, the work\ndone during an isothermal process is equal to the shaded area shown in\nFig. 15-7b.

In which process was more\nwork done by the gas?\nRESPONSE Our system is the gas. More work was done by the gas in the\nisothermal process, which we can see in two simple ways by looking at Fig. 15-3.\nFirst, the "average" pressure was higher during the isothermal process AB, so\nW = Pav AV was greater (AV is the same for both processes). Second, we can\nlook at the area under each curve as we showed in Fig. 15-7b: the area under\ncurve AB, which represents the work done, is greater (because curve AB is higher)\nthan the area under AC in Fig. 15-3.\nEXERCISE B Is the work done by the gas in process ADB of Fig. 15-6 greater than, less\nthan, or equal to the work done in the isothermal process AB?\nTable 15-1 gives a brief summary of the processes we have discussed.

We can determine the\nheat Q required using the latent heat of water, as in Section 14-5. Work too will\nbe done: W = P AV. The first law of thermodynamics will then give us AU.\nSOLUTION The latent heat of vaporization of water (Table 14-3) is\nLy = 22.6 × 105 J/kg. So the heat input required for this process is (Eq. 14-4)\nQ = mL = (1.00 kg)(22.6 × 105 J/kg) = 22.6 × 105 J.\nThe work done by the water is (Eq. 15-3 since P is constant)\nW= PAV = (1.01 × 105 N/m2)[(1671 × 10-3 m3) - (1 × 10-3 m3)]\n= 1.69 × 105 J,\nwhere we used 1 atm = 1.01 × 105 N/m2 and 1L = 103 cm3 = 10-3m3. Then\nAU = Q - W = (22.6 × 105 J) - (1.7× 105 J) = 20.9 × 105 J.\nNOTE Most of the heat added goes to increasing the internal energy of the water\n(increasing molecular energy to overcome the attraction that held the molecules\nclose together in the liquid state). Only a small part (< 10%) goes into doing work.\nNOTE Equation 14-1, U = 2nRT, would tell us that AU = 0 here because\nAT = 0. Yet we determined that AU = 21 × 105 J. What is wrong? Equation\n14-1 applies only to an ideal monatomic gas, not to liquid water.\n*\n15-3 Human Metabolism and\nthe First Law\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nEnergy in the human body\nHuman beings and other animals do work. Work is done when a person walks or\nruns, or lifts a heavy object. Work requires energy. Energy is also needed for\ngrowth-to make new cells, and to replace old cells that have died. A great many\nenergy-transforming processes occur within an organism, and they are referred\nto as metabolism.\nFIGURE 15-9 Bike rider getting\nan input of energy.\nSin\nWe can apply the first law of thermodynamics,\nAU = Q - W,\nto an organism: say, the human body. Work W is done by the body in its various\nactivities; if this is not to result in a decrease in the body\'s internal energy (and\ntemperature), energy must somehow be added to compensate. The body\'s internal\nenergy is not maintained by a flow of heat Q into the body, however. Normally,\nthe body is at a higher temperature than its surroundings, so heat usually flows\nout of the body. Even on a very hot day when heat is absorbed, the body has no\nway of utilizing this heat to support its vital processes. What then is the source of\nenergy that allows us to do work? It is the internal energy (chemical potential\nenergy) stored in foods (Fig. 15-9). In a closed system, the internal energy\nchanges only as a result of heat flow or work done. In an open system, such as a\nhuman, internal energy itself can flow into or out of the system. When we eat\nfood, we are bringing internal energy into our bodies directly, which thus increases\nthe total internal energy U in our bodies. This energy eventually goes into work\nand heat flow from the body according to the first law.\nThe metabolic rate is the rate at which internal energy is transformed within\nthe body. It is usually specified in kcal/h or in watts. Typical metabolic rates for a\nvariety of human activities are given in Table 15-2 (top of next page) for an\n"average" 65-kg adult.\n418 CHAPTER 15 The Laws of Thermodynamics\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 15-7\nEnergy transformation in the body.

There are, how-\never, many processes we can imagine that conserve energy but are not observed\nto occur in nature. For example, when a hot object is placed in contact with a cold\nobject, heat flows from the hotter one to the colder one, never spontaneously\nfrom colder to hotter. If heat were to leave the colder object and pass to the hotter\none, energy could still be conserved. Yet it does not happen spontaneously .* As\na second example, consider what happens when you drop a rock and it hits the\nground. The initial potential energy of the rock changes to kinetic energy as the\nrock falls. When the rock hits the ground, this energy in turn is transformed into\ninternal energy of the rock and the ground in the vicinity of the impact; the mole-\ncules move faster and the temperature rises slightly. But have you seen the reverse\nhappen-a rock at rest on the ground suddenly rise up in the air because the\nthermal energy of molecules is transformed into kinetic energy of the rock as a\nwhole? Energy could be conserved in this process, yet we never see it happen.\nThere are many other examples of processes that occur in nature but whose\nreverse does not. Here are two more. (1) If you put a layer of salt in a jar and\ncover it with a layer of similar-sized grains of pepper, when you shake it you get a\nthorough mixture. But no matter how long you shake it, the mixture does not\nseparate into two layers again. (2) Coffee cups and glasses break spontaneously\nif you drop them. But they do not go back together spontaneously (Fig. 15-10).\nThe first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy) would not be violated\nif any of these processes occurred in reverse. To explain this lack of reversibility,\nscientists in the latter half of the nineteenth century formulated a new principle\nknown as the second law of thermodynamics.\n*By spontaneously, we mean by itself without input of work of some sort. (A refrigerator does move\nheat from a cold environment to a warmer one, but only because its motor does work-Section 15-6.)\n?\n?\nFIGURE 15-10 Have you ever\nobserved this process, a broken\ncup spontaneously reassembling\nand rising up onto a table? This\nprocess could conserve energy.\nBut it never happens.\n(b) Later: cup reassembles\nand rises up.\n(c) Later still: cup lands on table.\n(a) Initial state.\nSECTION 15-4 The Second Law of Thermodynamics-Introduction 419\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n(Clausius statement)\nHigh\ntemperature, TH\nQH\nEngine\nQL\nLow\ntemperature, TL\nW\nFIGURE 15-11 Schematic diagram\nof energy transfers for a heat engine.\nCAUTION\nSign convention for heat engines:\nQH > 0, QL > 0, W > 0\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nEngines\nFIGURE 15-12\nSteam engines.\nThe second law of thermodynamics is a statement about which processes\noccur in nature and which do not. It can be stated in a variety of ways, all of\nwhich are equivalent. One statement, due to R. J. E. Clausius (1822-1888), is that\nheat can flow spontaneously from a hot object to a cold object; heat will not\nflow spontaneously from a cold object to a hot object.\nSince this statement applies to one particular process, it is not obvious how it\napplies to other processes. A more general statement is needed that will include\nother possible processes in a more obvious way.\nThe development of a general statement of the second law of thermodynamics\nwas based partly on the study of heat engines. A heat engine is any device that\nchanges thermal energy into mechanical work, such as a steam engine or an auto-\nmobile engine. We now examine heat engines, both from a practical point of view\nand to show their importance in developing the second law of thermodynamics.\n15-5 Heat Engines\nIt is easy to produce thermal energy by doing work-for example, by simply rub-\nbing your hands together briskly, or indeed by any frictional process. But to get\nwork from thermal energy is more difficult, and a practical device to do so was\ninvented only about 1700 with the development of the steam engine.\nThe basic idea behind any heat engine is that mechanical energy can be\nobtained from thermal energy only when heat is allowed to flow from a high\ntemperature to a low temperature. In the process, some of the heat can then be\ntransformed to mechanical work, as diagrammed schematically in Fig. 15-11.\nUseful heat engines run in a repeating cycle: that is, the system returns repeat-\nedly to its starting point, and thus can run continuously. In each cycle the change\nin internal energy of the system is AU = 0 because it returns to the starting state.\nThus a heat input QH at a high temperature TH is partly transformed into work W and\npartly exhausted as heat QL at a lower temperature TL (Fig. 15-11). By conservation\nof energy, QH = W + QL . The high and low temperatures, TH and TL, are called\nthe operating temperatures of the engine. Note carefully that we are now using a\nnew (and intuitive) sign convention for heat engines: we take QH, QL, and Was\nalways positive. The direction of each energy transfer is shown by the arrow on\nthe applicable diagram, such as Fig. 15-11.\nSteam Engine and Internal Combustion Engine\nThe operation of a steam engine is shown in Fig. 15-12.

As the piston returns to\nits original position, it forces the gases out the exhaust valve which opens. A steam\nturbine, Fig. 15-12b, is very similar except that the reciprocating piston is replaced by\na rotating turbine that resembles a paddlewheel with many sets of blades. Most of\nour electricity today is generated using steam turbines.+ The material that is heated\nand cooled, steam in this case, is called the working substance. In an old-time steam\nengine (see page 412), the high temperature is obtained by burning coal, oil, or other\nfuel to heat the steam.\nIn an internal combustion engine (used in most automobiles), the high tem-\nperature is achieved by burning the gasoline-air mixture in the cylinder itself\n(ignited by the spark plug), as described in Fig. 15-13.\nIntake\nvalve\n(open)\nGas-air\nmixture from\ncarburetor\nExhaust\nvalve\n(closed)\nBoth valves\nclosed\nBoth valves\nclosed\nCylinder\nPiston\nSpark\nplug\n(firing)\nBoth valves\nclosed\nRings\nExhaust\nvalve\n(open)\nTo exhaust\npipe\nConnecting\nrod\nCrankshaft\n(a) Intake\n(b) Compression\n(c) Ignition\n(d) Expansion\n(power stroke)\n(e) Exhaust\nFIGURE 15-13 Four-stroke-cycle internal combustion engine: (a) the gasoline-air\nmixture flows into the cylinder as the piston moves down; (b) the piston moves upward\nand compresses the gas; (c) the brief instant when firing of the spark plug ignites the\nhighly compressed gasoline-air mixture, raising it to a high temperature; (d) the gases, now\nat high temperature and pressure, expand against the piston in this, the power stroke;\n(e) the burned gases are pushed out to the exhaust pipe. When the piston reaches the top,\nthe exhaust valve closes and the intake valve opens, and the whole cycle repeats.\n(a), (b), (d), and (e) are the four strokes of the cycle.\n*Why a AT Is Needed to Drive a Heat Engine\nTo see why a temperature difference is required to run an engine, consider a steam\nengine. In the reciprocating engine, for example, suppose there were no con-\ndenser or pump (Fig. 15-12a), and that the steam was at the same temperature\nthroughout the system. Then the pressure of the gas being exhausted would be\nthe same as on intake. The work done by the gas on the piston when it expanded\nwould equal the amount of work done by the piston to force the steam out the\nexhaust; hence, no net work would be done. In a real engine, the exhausted gas is\ncooled to a lower temperature and condensed so that the exhaust pressure is less\nthan the intake pressure. Thus, the work the piston must do on the gas to expel it\non the exhaust stroke is less than the work done by the gas on the piston during\nthe intake. So a net amount of work can be obtained-but only if there is this\ndifference of temperature. Similarly, in the gas turbine if the gas isn't cooled,\nthe pressure on each side of the blades would be the same. By cooling the gas on\nthe exhaust side, the pressure on the back side of the blade is less and hence the\nturbine turns.\n*Even nuclear power plants utilize steam turbines; the nuclear fuel-uranium-serves as fuel to heat\nthe steam.\nSECTION 15-5 Heat Engines 421\n", 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'High\ntemperature, TH\nQH\n-\nEngine\nQL\nLow\ntemperature, TL\nW\nFIGURE 15-11 (Repeated.)\nSchematic diagram of energy\ntransfers for a heat engine.\nQH\ne = W = CH - QL\nQH\nEfficiency\nThe efficiency, e, of any heat engine can be defined as the ratio of the work it\ndoes, W, to the heat input at the high temperature, QH (Fig. 15-11):\ne = W.\n(15-4a)\nThis is a sensible definition since W is the output (what you get from the engine),\nwhereas QH is what you put in and pay for in burned fuel.

Note that e could\nbe 1.0 (or 100%) only if QL were zero-that is, only if no heat were exhausted\nto the environment (which we will see shortly never happens).\nEXAMPLE 15-8\nCar efficiency.

We can use the def-\ninition of efficiency, Eq. 15-4 in its various forms, to find first QH and then QL .\nSOLUTION (a) From Eq. 15-4a, e = W/QH, we solve for QH:\n23,000 J\nOH = "\nW = 0.20\n= 1.15 × 105 J = 115 kJ.\nThe engine requires 115 kJ/s = 115 kW of heat input.\n(b) Now we use Eq. 15-4b (e = 1 - QL/QH) and solve for QL:\nQL\n= 1 - e\nQH\nSO\nQL = (1 - e)QH = (0.80)115 kJ\n= 92 kJ.\nThe engine discharges heat to the environment at a rate of 92 KJ/s = 92kW.\nNOTE Of the 115 kJ that enters the engine per second, only 23 kJ (20%) does\nuseful work whereas 92 kJ (80%) is wasted as heat output.\nNOTE The problem was stated in terms of energy per unit time. We could just\nas well have stated it in terms of power, since 1 J/s = 1 watt.\nCarnot Engine\nTo see how to increase efficiency, the French scientist Sadi Carnot (1796-1832)\nexamined the characteristics of an ideal engine, now called a Carnot engine. No\nCarnot engine actually exists, but as a theoretical idea it played an important role\nin the development and understanding of the second law of thermodynamics.\n422 CHAPTER 15 The Laws of Thermodynamics\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': '(4)\nd ->a\nAdiabatic\ncompression\nP\nT\n1\nTH\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\na\nQH\nQH\n(1)\na ->b\nIsothermal\nexpansion\nb\n(2)\nb-+c\nAdiabatic\nexpansion\nQ= 0\n0\nd\n-- TH\nc\nTL\nV\nQ = 0\nQL\n(3)\nc -+d\nIsothermal\ncompression\nFIGURE 15-14 The Carnot cycle. Heat engines work in\na cycle, and the cycle for the theoretical Carnot engine\nbegins at point "a" on this PV diagram for an ideal gas.\n(1) The gas is first expanded isothermally, with the addition\nof heat QH, along the path "ab" at temperature TH .\n(2) Next the gas expands adiabatically from "b" to "c"-\nno heat is exchanged, but the temperature drops to TL ·\n(3) The gas is then compressed at constant temperature TL ,\npath cd, and heat QL flows out. (4) Finally, the gas is\ncompressed adiabatically, path da, back to its original state.\nThe idealized Carnot engine consisted of four processes done in a cycle, two\nof which are adiabatic (Q = 0) and two are isothermal (AT = 0). This idealized\ncycle is shown in Fig. 15-14. Each of the processes was considered to be done\nreversibly. That is, each of the processes (say, during expansion of the gases\nagainst a piston) was done so slowly that the process could be considered a series\nof equilibrium states, and the whole process could be done in reverse with no\nchange in the magnitude of work done or heat exchanged. A real process, on the\nother hand, would occur more quickly; there would be turbulence in the gas, fric-\ntion would be present, and so on. Because of these factors, a real process cannot\nbe done precisely in reverse-the turbulence would be different and the heat lost\nto friction would not reverse itself. Thus, real processes are irreversible.\nThe isothermal processes of a Carnot engine, where heats QH and QL are\ntransferred, are assumed to be done at constant temperatures TH and TL. That is,\nthe system is assumed to be in contact with idealized heat reservoirs (page 414)\nwhich are so large their temperatures don\'t change significantly when QH and QL\nare transferred.\nCarnot showed that for an ideal reversible engine, the heats QH and QL\nare proportional to the operating temperatures TH and TL (in kelvins):\nQH/QL = TH/TL .

A higher efficiency would violate the second law of thermodynamics.+\nReal engines always have an efficiency lower than this because of losses due to\nfriction and the like. Real engines that are well designed reach 60 to 80% of the\nCarnot efficiency.\n+If an engine had a higher efficiency than Eq. 15-5, it could be used in conjunction with a Carnot\nengine that is made to work in reverse as a refrigerator. If W was the same for both, the net result\nwould be a flow of heat at a low temperature to a high temperature without work being done. That\nwould violate the Clausius statement of the second law.\nSECTION 15-5 Heat Engines 423\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': "High\ntemperature\nHeat\nNOT\nPOSSIBLE\nWork\nEngine\nFIGURE 15-15 Diagram of an\nimpossible perfect heat engine in which\nall heat input is used to do work.\nSECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n(Kelvin-Planck statement)\nEXAMPLE 15-9\nSteam engine efficiency.

Do you believe these claims?\nAPPROACH The engine's efficiency can be calculated from the definition,\nEq. 15-4.

Only if the exhaust temperature, TL, were at absolute zero\nwould 100% efficiency be reachable. But getting to absolute zero is a practical (as\nwell as theoretical) impossibility. [Careful experimentation suggests that abso-\nlute zero is unattainable. This result is known as the third law of thermodynamics.]\nBecause no engine can be 100% efficient, it can be stated that\nno device is possible whose sole effect is to transform a given amount of heat\ncompletely into work.\nThis is known as the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics.\nFigure 15-15 diagrams the ideal perfect heat engine, which can not exist.\n424 CHAPTER 15 The Laws of Thermodynamics\n", 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'If the second law were not true, so that a perfect engine could be built, rather\nremarkable things could happen.

You can often feel this\nheated air coming out beneath the refrigerator. The work W is usually done by\nan electric motor which compresses a fluid, as illustrated in Fig. 15-17.

How long would it take to freeze an ice-cube tray that contains 600 g\nof water at 0℃?\nAPPROACH In Eq. 15-6b, QL is the heat that must be transferred out of the\nwater so it will become ice. To determine QL, we use the latent heat of fusion L\nof water and Eq. 14-4, Q = mL.\nSOLUTION From Table 14-3, L = 333 KJ/kg for water. Hence\nQL= mL= (0.600 kg)(3.33 × 105 J/kg) = 2.0× 105 J\nis the total energy that needs to be removed from the water. The freezer does\nwork at the rate of 200 watts = 200 J/s = W/t, which is the work W it can do in\nt seconds. We solve for t: t = W/(200 J/s). For W, we can also use Eq. 15-6a:\nW = QL/COP.

We plug the\nheater into the wall, it draws 1500 W of electricity, and it delivers 1500 W of heat to\nthe room. Our heat pump when plugged into the wall also draws 1500 W of elec-\ntricity (which is what we pay for), but it delivers 4500 W of heat!\n* SEER Rating\nCooling devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners are often given a rating\nknown as SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio), which is defined as\nSEER\n(electrical input in watt-hours)\n(heat removed in Btu)\n,\nas measured by averaging over varying (seasonal) conditions. The definition of the\nSEER is basically the same as the COP except for the (unfortunate) mixed units.\nGiven that 1 Btu = 1056 J (see Section 14-1 and Problem 5 in Chapter 14), then a\nSEER = 1 is a COP equal to (1 Btu/1 W·h) = (1056 J)/(1 J/s × 3600s) = 0.29.\nA COP = 1 is a SEER = 1/0.29 = 3.4.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nSEER rating\nSECTION 15-6 427\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 17, 'type': 'text', 'content': '15-7 Entropy and the Second Law\nof Thermodynamics\nThus far we have stated the second law of thermodynamics for specific situations.\nWhat we really need is a general statement of the second law of thermodynamics\nthat will cover all situations, including processes discussed earlier in this Chapter\nthat are not observed in nature even though they would not violate the first law of\nthermodynamics. It was not until the latter half of the nineteenth century that the\nsecond law of thermodynamics was finally stated in a general way-namely, in\nterms of a quantity called entropy, introduced by Clausius in the 1860s. Entropy,\nunlike heat, is a function of the state of a system. That is, a system in a given state\nhas a temperature, a volume, a pressure, a mass, and also has a particular value\nof entropy. In the next Section, we will see that entropy can be interpreted as a\nmeasure of the order or disorder of a system.\nWhen we deal with entropy-as with potential energy-it is the change in\nentropy during a process that is important, not the absolute amount. According\nto Clausius, the change in entropy S of a system, when an amount of heat Q is\nadded to it by a reversible* process at constant temperature, is given by\nAS = 2,\nT\n(15-8)\nwhere T is the kelvin temperature. (If heat is lost, Q is negative in this equation,\nas per our original sign conventions on page 413.)\nEXAMPLE 15-13\nEntropy change in melting. An ice cube of mass 56 g is\ntaken from a storage compartment at 0°C and placed in a paper cup. After a few\nminutes, exactly half of the mass of the ice cube has melted, becoming water at\n0°C. Find the change in entropy of the ice/water.\nAPPROACH We consider the 56 g of water, initially in the form of ice, as our\nsystem. To determine the entropy change, we first must find the heat needed to\nmelt the ice, which we do using the latent heat of fusion of water, L = 333 KJ/kg\n(Section 14-5). The heat Q required comes from the surroundings.\nSOLUTION The heat required to melt 28 g of ice (half of the 56-g ice cube) is\nQ = mL = (0.028 kg)(333 kJ/kg) = 9.3 kJ.\nThe temperature remains constant in our process, so we can find the change in\nentropy from Eq. 15-8:\nAS = = 9.3 KJ\n273 K\n= 34 J/K.\nNOTE The change in entropy of the surroundings (cup, air) has not been computed.\nThe temperature in Example 15-13 was constant, so the calculation was short.\nIf the temperature varies during a process, a summation of the heat flow over the\nchanging temperature can often be calculated using calculus or a computer. How-\never, if the temperature change is not too great, a reasonable approximation can be\nmade using the average value of the temperature, as indicated in the next Example.\nEXAMPLE 15-14\nESTIMATE\nEntropy change when water samples are\nmixed. A sample of 50.0 kg of water at 20.00℃ is mixed with 50.0 kg of water\nat 24.00°C. Estimate the change in entropy.\nAPPROACH The final temperature of the mixture will be 22.00℃, since we\nstarted with equal amounts of water. We use the specific heat of water and\nthe methods of calorimetry (Sections 14-3 and 14-4) to determine the heat\ntransferred. Then we use the average temperature of each sample of water to\nestimate the entropy change (AQ/T).\n*Real processes are irreversible. Because entropy is a state variable, the change in entropy AS for an\nirreversible process can be determined by calculating AS for a reversible process between the same\ntwo states.\n428 CHAPTER 15 The Laws of Thermodynamics\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'SOLUTION A quantity of heat,\nQ = mc AT = (50.0 kg)(4186 J/kg · C°)(2.00 Cº) = 4.186 × 105 J,\nflows out of the hot water as it cools down from 24℃ to 22ºC, and this heat flows\ninto the cold water as it warms from 20℃ to 22℃. The total change in entropy,\nAS, will be the sum of the changes in entropy of the hot water, ASH, and that\nof the cold water, ASc:\nAS = ASH + ASC.\nWe estimate entropy changes by writing AS = Q/Tav, where Tav is an "average"\ntemperature for each process, which ought to give a reasonable estimate since\nthe temperature change is small. For the hot water we use an average tempera-\nture of 23°C (296 K), and for the cold water an average temperature of 21℃\n(294 K). Thus\nASH ~\n296 K\n4.186 × 105 J\n=\n-1414 J/K\nwhich is negative because this heat flows out (sign conventions, page 413),\nwhereas heat is added to the cold water:\nASC ~\n22\n4.186 × 105 J\n=\n1424 J/K.\n294 K\nThe entropy of the hot water (SH) decreases because heat flows out of the hot water.\nBut the entropy of the cold water (Sc) increases by a greater amount. The total\nchange in entropy is\nAS = ASH + ASC ~ - 1414J/K + 1424 J/K ~ 10 J/K.\nIn Example 15-14, we saw that although the entropy of one part of the system\ndecreased, the entropy of the other part increased by a greater amount; the net\nchange in entropy of the whole system was positive. This result, which we have\ncalculated for a specific case in Example 15-14, has been found to hold in all\nother cases tested. That is, the total entropy of an isolated system is found to\nincrease in all natural processes. The second law of thermodynamics can be stated\nin terms of entropy as follows: The entropy of an isolated system never decreases.\nIt can only stay the same or increase. Entropy can remain the same only for an\nidealized (reversible) process. For any real process, the change in entropy AS is\ngreater than zero:\nAS > 0.\n[real process] (15-9)\nIf the system is not isolated, then the change in entropy of the system, ASsys , plus\nthe change in entropy of the environment, ASenv, must be greater than or equal\nto zero:\nAS = ASsys + ASenv ≥ 0.\n(15-10)\nOnly idealized processes can have AS = 0. Real processes always have AS > 0.\nThis, then, is the general statement of the second law of thermodynamics:\nthe total entropy of any system plus that of its environment increases as a\nresult of any natural process.\nAlthough the entropy of one part of the universe may decrease in any natural\nprocess (see Example 15-14), the entropy of some other part of the universe\nalways increases by a greater amount, so the total entropy always increases.\nNow that we finally have a quantitative general statement of the second law\nof thermodynamics, we can see that it is an unusual law. It differs considerably\nfrom other laws of physics, which are typically equalities (such as F = ma) or\nconservation laws (such as for energy and momentum). The second law of ther-\nmodynamics introduces a new quantity, the entropy S, but does not tell us it is\nconserved. Quite the opposite. Entropy is not conserved in natural processes.\nEntropy always increases in time for real processes.\nSECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n(general statement)\nSECTION 15-7 Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics 429\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n(general statement)\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nBiological development\n15-8 Order to Disorder\nThe concept of entropy, as we have discussed it so far, may seem rather abstract.\nBut we can relate it to the more ordinary concepts of order and disorder. In fact,\nthe entropy of a system can be considered a measure of the disorder of the system.\nThen the second law of thermodynamics can be stated simply as:\nnatural processes tend to move toward a state of greater disorder.\nExactly what we mean by disorder may not always be clear, so we now consider a\nfew examples. Some of these will show us how this very general statement of the\nsecond law applies beyond what we usually consider as thermodynamics.\nLet us look at the simple processes mentioned in Section 15-4. First, a jar\ncontaining separate layers of salt and pepper is more orderly than a jar in which the\nsalt and pepper are all mixed up. Shaking a jar containing separate layers results in\na mixture, and no amount of shaking brings the orderly layers back again. The\nnatural process is from a state of relative order (layers) to one of relative disorder\n(a mixture), not the reverse. That is, disorder increases. Second, a solid coffee cup\nis a more "orderly" and useful object than the pieces of a broken cup. Cups break\nwhen they fall, but they do not spontaneously mend themselves (as faked in\nFig. 15-10). Again, the normal course of events is an increase of disorder.\nLet us consider some processes for which we have actually calculated the\nentropy change, and see that an increase in entropy results in an increase in dis-\norder (or vice versa). When ice melts to water at 0℃, the entropy of the water\nincreases (Example 15-13). Intuitively, we can think of solid water, ice, as being\nmore ordered than the less orderly fluid state which can flow all over the place.\nThis change from order to disorder can be seen more clearly from the molecular\npoint of view: the orderly arrangement of water molecules in an ice crystal has\nchanged to the disorderly and somewhat random motion of the molecules in the\nfluid state.\nWhen a hot substance is put in contact with a cold substance, heat flows from the high\ntemperature to the low until the two substances reach the same intermediate tempera-\nture. Entropy increases, as we saw in Example 15-14. At the beginning of the process\nwe can distinguish two classes of molecules: those with a high average kinetic energy\n(the hot object), and those with a low average kinetic energy (the cooler object). After\nthe process in which heat flows, all the molecules are in one class with the same average\nkinetic energy; we no longer have the more orderly arrangement of molecules in two\nclasses. Order has gone to disorder. Furthermore, the separate hot and cold objects\ncould serve as the hot- and cold-temperature regions of a heat engine, and thus\ncould be used to obtain useful work. But once the two objects are put in contact and\nreach the same temperature, no work can be obtained. Disorder has increased,\nbecause a system that has the ability to perform work must surely be considered to\nhave a higher order than a system no longer able to do work.\nWhen a stone falls to the ground, its macroscopic kinetic energy is transformed\nto thermal energy. (We noted earlier that the reverse never happens: a stone never\nabsorbs thermal energy and rises into the air of its own accord.) This is another\nexample of order changing to disorder. Thermal energy is associated with the\ndisorderly random motion of molecules, but the molecules in the falling stone all\nhave the same velocity downward in addition to their own random velocities.\nThus, the more orderly kinetic energy of the stone as a whole (which could do useful\nwork) is changed to disordered thermal energy when the stone strikes the ground.\nDisorder increases in this process, as it does in all processes that occur in nature.\nBiological Development\nAn interesting example of the increase in entropy relates to the biological devel-\nopment and growth of organisms. Clearly, a human being is a highly ordered\norganism. The development of an individual from a single cell to a grown person\nis a process of increasing order. Evolution too might be seen as an increase in order.\n430 CHAPTER 15 The Laws of Thermodynamics\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Do these processes violate the second law of thermodynamics? No, they do not.\nIn the processes of growth and evolution, and even during the mature life of\nan individual, waste products are eliminated. These small molecules that remain as\na result of metabolism are simple molecules without much order. Thus they repre-\nsent relatively higher disorder or entropy. Indeed, the total entropy of the molecules\ncast aside by organisms during the processes of development and growth is greater\nthan the decrease in entropy associated with the order of the growing individual\nor evolving species.\n"Time\'s Arrow"\nAnother aspect of the second law of thermodynamics is that it tells us in which\ndirection processes go. If you were to see a film being run backward, you would\nundoubtedly be able to tell that it was run backward. For you would see odd\noccurrences, such as a broken coffee cup rising from the floor and reassembling\non a table, or a torn balloon suddenly becoming whole again and filled with air.\nWe know these things don\'t happen in real life; they are processes in which order\nincreases-or entropy decreases. They violate the second law of thermodynam-\nics. When watching a movie (or imagining that time could go backward), we are\ntipped off to a reversal of time by observing whether entropy (and disorder) is\nincreasing or decreasing. Hence, entropy has been called time\'s arrow, because it can\ntell us in which direction time is going.\n15-9 Unavailability of Energy;\nHeat Death\nIn the process of heat conduction from a hot object to a cold one, we have seen\nthat entropy increases and that order goes to disorder. The separate hot and cold\nobjects could serve as the high- and low-temperature regions for a heat engine\nand thus could be used to obtain useful work. But after the two objects are put in\ncontact with each other and reach the same uniform temperature, no work can be\nobtained from them. With regard to being able to do useful work, order has gone\nto disorder in this process.\nThe same can be said about a falling rock that comes to rest upon striking the\nground. Before hitting the ground, all the kinetic energy of the rock could have\nbeen used to do useful work. But once the rock\'s mechanical kinetic energy\nbecomes thermal energy, doing useful work is no longer possible.\nBoth these examples illustrate another important aspect of the second law of\nthermodynamics:\nin any natural process, some energy becomes unavailable to do useful work.\nIn any process, no energy is ever lost (it is always conserved). Rather, energy becomes\nless useful-it can do less useful work. As time goes on, energy is degraded, in a\nsense. It goes from more orderly forms (such as mechanical) eventually to the\nleast orderly form: internal, or thermal, energy. Entropy is a factor here because\nthe amount of energy that becomes unavailable to do work is proportional to the\nchange in entropy during any process.\nA natural outcome of the degradation of energy is the prediction that as time\ngoes on, the universe should approach a state of maximum disorder. Matter would\nbecome a uniform mixture, and heat would have flowed from high-temperature\nregions to low-temperature regions until the whole universe is at one temperature.\nNo work could then be done. All the energy of the universe would have degraded\nto thermal energy. This prediction, called the heat death of the universe, has been\nmuch discussed, but it would lie very far in the future. It is a complicated subject,\nand some scientists question whether thermodynamics, as we now understand it,\nactually applies to the universe as a whole, which is at a much larger scale.+\n+When a star, like our Sun, loses energy by radiation, it becomes hotter (not cooler). By losing energy,\ngravity is able to compress the gas of which the Sun is made-becoming smaller and denser means\nthe Sun gets hotter. For astronomical objects, when heat flows from a hot object to a cooler object,\nthe hot object gets hotter and the cool one cooler. That is, the temperature difference increases.\nSECTION 15-9 Unavailability of Energy; Heat Death 431\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 21, 'type': 'text', 'content': '*\n15-10\nStatistical Interpretation of\nEntropy and the Second Law\nThe ideas of entropy and disorder are made clearer with the use of a statistical or\nprobabilistic analysis of the molecular state of a system. This statistical approach,\nwhich was first applied toward the end of the nineteenth century by Ludwig\nBoltzmann (1844-1906), makes a clear distinction between the "macrostate" and\nthe "microstate" of a system. The microstate of a system would be specified by\ngiving the position and velocity of every particle (or molecule). The macrostate\nof a system is specified by giving the far fewer macroscopic properties of the\nsystem-the temperature, pressure, number of moles, and so on. In reality, we\ncan know only the macrostate of a system. There are generally far too many mol-\necules in a system to be able to know the velocity and position of every one at a\ngiven moment. Nonetheless, we can hypothesize a great many different micro-\nstates that can correspond to the same macrostate.\nLet us take a very simple example. Suppose you repeatedly shake four coins\nin your hand and drop them on a table. Specifying the number of heads and the\nnumber of tails that appear on a given throw is the macrostate of this system.\nSpecifying each coin as being a head or a tail is the microstate of the system. In\nthe following Table we see how many microstates correspond to each macrostate:\nCAUTION\nCareful use of probability\nMacrostate\nPossible Microstates\n(H = heads, T = tails)\nNumber of\nMicrostates\n4 heads\nHH HH\n1\n3 heads, 1 tail\nHHHT, HHTH, HTHH, THHH\n4\n2 heads, 2 tails\nHHTT, HTHT, THHT, HTTH, THTH, TTHH\n6\n1 head, 3 tails\nTTTH, TTHT, THTT, HTTT\n4\n4 tails\nTTTT\n1\nA basic assumption behind the statistical approach is that each microstate is\nequally probable. Thus the number of microstates that give the same macrostate\ncorresponds to the relative probability of that macrostate occurring. The macrostate\nof two heads and two tails is the most probable one in our case of tossing four coins;\nout of the total of 16 possible microstates, six correspond to two heads and two tails,\nso the probability of throwing two heads and two tails is 6 out of 16, or 38%. The\nprobability of throwing one head and three tails is 4 out of 16, or 25%. The prob-\nability of four heads is only 1 in 16, or 6%. If you threw the coins 16 times, you\nmight not find that two heads and two tails appear exactly 6 times, or four tails\nexactly once. These are only probabilities or averages. But if you made 1600 throws,\nvery nearly 38% of them would be two heads and two tails. The greater the number\nof tries, the closer the percentages are to the calculated probabilities.\nEXERCISE G In the Table above, what is the probability that there will be at least two\nheads? (a) 4; (b) 16; (c) }; (d) }; (e) 1.\nIf we toss more coins-say, 100 all at the same time-the relative probability\nof throwing all heads (or all tails) is greatly reduced. There is only one microstate\ncorresponding to all heads. For 99 heads and 1 tail, there are 100 microstates\nbecause each of the coins could be the one tail. The relative probabilities for other\nmacrostates are given in Table 15-3 (top of next page). About 1.3 × 1030\nmicrostates are possible .* Thus the relative probability of finding all heads is\nabout 1 in 1030, an incredibly unlikely event! The probability of obtaining 50 heads\nand 50 tails (see Table 15-3) is (1.0 × 1029)/(1.3 × 1030) = 0.08 or 8%. The\nprobability of obtaining anything between 45 and 55 heads is about 70%.\n*Each coin has two possibilities, heads or tails. Then the possible number of microstates is\n2 × 2×2× ···= 2100 = 1.3 × 1030 (using a calculator or logarithms).\n432 CHAPTER 15 The Laws of Thermodynamics\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 22, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'TABLE 15-3 Probabilities of Various Macrostates\nfor 100 Coin Tosses\nMacrostate\nNumber of\nMicrostates\nProbability\nHeads\nTails\n100\n0\n1\n7.9× 10-31\n99\n1\n1.0× 102\n7.9 × 10-29\n90\n10\n1.7 × 1013\n1.4 × 10-17\n80\n20\n5.4 × 1020\n4.2 × 10-10\n60\n40\n1.4 × 1028\n0.011\n55\n45\n6.1 × 1028\n0.047\n50\n50\n1.0 × 1029\n0.077\n45\n55\n6.1 × 1028\n0.047\n40\n60\n1.4 × 1028\n0.011\n20\n80\n5.4 × 1020\n4.2 × 10-10\n10\n90\n1.7 × 1013\n1.4 × 10-17\n1\n99\n1.0× 102\n7.9 × 10-29\n0\n100\n1\n7.9 × 10-31\nThus we see that as the number of coins increases, the probability of obtaining\nthe most orderly arrangement (all heads or all tails) becomes extremely unlikely.\nThe least orderly arrangement (half heads, half tails) is the most probable, and the\nprobability of being within, say, 5% of the most probable arrangement greatly\nincreases as the number of coins increases. These same ideas can be applied to the\nmolecules of a system. For example, the most probable state of a gas (say, the\nair in a room) is one in which the molecules take up the whole space and move\nabout randomly; this corresponds to the Maxwellian distribution, Fig. 15-19a\n(and see Section 13-10). On the other hand, the very orderly arrangement of\nall the molecules located in one corner of the room and all moving with the same\nvelocity (Fig. 15-19b) is extremely unlikely.\nFraction of molecules\nFrom these examples, we can see that probability is directly related to disorder\nand hence to entropy. That is, the most probable state is the one with greatest\nentropy, or greatest disorder and randomness. The processes we actually observe\nare those where the entropy increase is greatest.\n0\nSpeed, v\n(a)\nFraction of molecules\nIn terms of probability, the second law of thermodynamics-which tells us\nthat entropy increases in any process-reduces to the statement that those\nprocesses occur which are most probable.\nThere is an additional element, however. The second law in terms of prob-\nability does not forbid a decrease in entropy. Rather, it says the probability\nis extremely low. It is not impossible that salt and pepper could separate\nspontaneously into layers, or that a broken cup could mend itself (Fig. 15-10). It is\neven possible that a lake could freeze over on a hot summer day (that is, for heat\nto flow out of the cold lake into the warmer surroundings). But the probability for\nsuch events occurring is almost always miniscule. In our coin examples, we saw\nthat increasing the number of coins from 4 to 100 drastically reduced the proba-\nbility of large deviations from the average, or most probable, arrangement. In\nordinary systems we are not dealing with only 100 molecules, but with extremely\nlarge numbers of molecules: in 1 mole alone there are 6 × 1023 molecules. Hence\nthe probability of deviation far from the average is incredibly tiny. For example, it\nhas been calculated that the probability that a stone resting on the ground could\ntransform 1 cal of thermal energy into mechanical energy and rise up into the air\nis much less likely than the probability that a group of monkeys typing randomly\nwould by chance produce the complete works of Shakespeare. Put another way,\nthe probability is less than once in the entire age of the universe; this could be what\n"never" means.\nO\nSpeed, v\n(b)\nFIGURE 15-19 (a) Most probable\ndistribution of molecular speeds\nin a gas (Maxwellian, or random).\n(b) Orderly, but highly unlikely,\ndistribution of speeds in which all\nmolecules have nearly the same speed.\n*SECTION 15-10 Statistical Interpretation of Entropy and the Second Law 433\n', 'chapter_title': 'EXERCISE A What would be the internal energy change in Example 15-1 if 2500 J of heat is added to the system and 1800 J of work is done by the system (i.e., as output)?'}, {'page_number': 23, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'inDiese\n(a)\n(b)\nFIGURE 15-20 (a) A fossil-fuel steam plant (this one uses forest waste products = biomass).\n(b) An array of mirrors focuses sunlight on a boiler to produce steam at a solar energy installation.\n(c) Large cooling towers at an electric generating plant.\n(c)\nFIGURE 15-21 Mechanical energy\nis transformed to electric energy\nwith a turbine and generator.\nSource of energy:\nwater, steam, wind\nElectric\ngenerator\n00000\n000.00\nTurbine\nElectric\nenergy\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHeat engines and thermal pollution\n*\n15-11 Thermal Pollution, Global\nWarming, and Energy Resources\nMuch of the energy we use in everyday life-from motor vehicles to most of the elec-\ntricity produced by power plants-uses a heat engine. More than 2 of the electric\nenergy produced in the U.S. is generated at fossil-fuel steam plants (coal, oil, or gas-\nsee Fig. 15-20a), and they make use of a heat engine (steam engines). In electric\npower plants, the steam drives the turbines and generators (Fig. 15-21) whose output\nis electric energy. The various means to turn the turbine are shown in Table 15-4,\nalong with some of the advantages and disadvantages of each. Even nuclear power\nplants use a steam engine, run on nuclear fuel. Electricity produced by falling water\nat dams, by windmills, or by solar cells (Fig. 15-20b) does not involve a heat\nengine.\nThe heat output QL from every heat engine, from power plants to cars, is\nreferred to as thermal pollution because this heat (QL) must be absorbed by the\nenvironment-such as by water from rivers or lakes, or by the air using large cooling\ntowers (Fig. 15-20c). When water is the coolant, this heat raises the temperature of\nthe water before returning it to its source, altering the natural ecology of aquatic life\n(largely because warmer water holds less oxygen). In the case of air cooling towers,\nthe output heat QL raises the temperature of the atmosphere, which affects\nweather.\nAir pollution-by which we mean the chemicals released in the burning of fossil\nfuels in cars, power plants, and industrial furnaces-gives rise to smog and other\nproblems. Another issue is the buildup of CO2 in the Earth\'s atmosphere due to the\nburning of fossil fuels; the carbon in them combines with O2 of the air, forming CO2.\nThis CO2 absorbs some of the infrared radiation that the Earth naturally emits\n(Section 14-8), and thus contributes to global warming. The carbon footprint of\nany activity (home appliances, steel production, manufacture of goods, transportation)\nrefers to the negative impact on the environment due to the burning of fossil fuels\nwhich release CO2 (and other noxious products) into the atmosphere, contributing\nto climate change. A carbon footprint can be expressed in kg or tons of carbon\n(in the CO2). Limiting the burning of fossil fuels can help reduce these problems.\nThermal pollution, however, is unavoidable. Engineers can try to design and\nbuild engines that are more efficient, but they cannot surpass the Carnot efficiency\nand must live with Ty being at best the ambient temperature of water or air. The\nsecond law of thermodynamics tells us the limit imposed by nature.

Define the system you are dealing with; distinguish\nthe system under study from its surroundings.\nR\n2. When applying the first law of thermodynamics, be\ncareful of signs associated with work and heat. In the\nfirst law, work done by the system is positive; work\ndone on the system is negative. Heat added to the\nsystem is positive, but heat removed from it is negative.\nWith heat engines, we usually consider the heat intake,\nthe heat exhausted, and the work done as positive.\n3. Watch the units used for work and heat; work is most\noften expressed in joules, and heat can be in calories,\nkilocalories, or joules. Be consistent: choose only one\nunit for use throughout a given problem.\nSummary\nThe first law of thermodynamics states that the change in inter-\nnal energy AU of a system is equal to the heat added to the\nsystem, Q, minus the work done by the system, W:\nAU = Q - W.\n(15-1)\nThis important law is a statement of the conservation of energy,\nand is found to hold for all processes.\nAn isothermal process is a process carried out at constant\ntemperature.\nIn an adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged (Q = 0).\nThe work W done by a gas at constant pressure P is given by\nW = PAV,\n(15-3)\nwhere AV is the change in volume of the gas.\nA heat engine is a device for changing thermal energy, by\nmeans of heat flow, into useful work.\nThe efficiency e of a heat engine is defined as the ratio of\nthe work W done by the engine to the high temperature heat\ninput QH . Because of conservation of energy, the work output\nequals QH - QL, where QL is the heat exhausted at low tem-\nperature to the environment; hence\nW\ne = CH\nQH\n=\nQH - QL\nQH\n= 1 - QL\n.\n(15-4)\nQH\nQH, QL, and W, as defined for heat engines, are positive.\nThe upper limit on the efficiency (the Carnot efficiency)\ncan be written in terms of the higher and lower operating\ntemperatures (in kelvins) of the engine, TH and TL, as\nCideal = 1 - 4.\n(15-5)\nReal (irreversible) engines always have an efficiency less than this.\nThe operation of refrigerators and air conditioners is the\nreverse of a heat engine: work is done to extract heat QL\nfrom a cool region and exhaust it to a region at a higher temper-\nature. The coefficient of performance (COP) for either is\nCOP = &1,\nW\nrefrigerator or\nair conditioner\nd\n(15-6a)\nwhere W is the work needed to remove heat QL from the area\nwith the low temperature.\n436 CHAPTER 15 The Laws of Thermodynamics\n4. Temperatures must generally be expressed in kelvins;\ntemperature differences may be expressed in Co or K.\n5. Efficiency (or coefficient of performance) is a ratio\nof two energy transfers: useful output divided by\nrequired input. Efficiency (but not coefficient of\nperformance) is always less than 1 in value, and\nhence is often stated as a percentage.\n6. The entropy of a system increases when heat is added\nto the system, and decreases when heat is removed.\nIf heat is transferred from system A to system B,\nthe change in entropy of A is negative and the change\nin entropy of B is positive.\nA heat pump uses work W to bring heat QL from the cold\noutside and deliver heat QH to warm the interior. The coeffi-\ncient of performance of a heat pump is\nCOP = CH,\n[heat pump] (15-7)\nbecause it is the heat QH delivered inside the building that counts.\nThe second law of thermodynamics can be stated in sev-\neral equivalent ways:\n(a) heat flows spontaneously from a hot object to a cold\none, but not the reverse;\n(b) there can be no 100% efficient heat engine-that is, one\nthat can change a given amount of heat completely\ninto work;\n(c) natural processes tend to move toward a state of\ngreater disorder or greater entropy.\nStatement (c) is the most general statement of the second law\nof thermodynamics, and can be restated as: the total entropy, S,\nof any system plus that of its environment increases as a result\nof any natural process:\nAS > 0.\n(15-9)\nThe change in entropy in a process that transfers heat Q at\na constant temperature Tis\nAS = 2.\n(15-8)\nEntropy is a quantitative measure of the disorder of a\nsystem. The second law of thermodynamics also indicates that\nas time goes on, energy is degraded to less useful forms-that is,\nit is less available to do useful work.\nThe second law of thermodynamics tells us in which direction\nprocesses tend to proceed; hence entropy is called "time\'s arrow."\n[*Entropy can be examined from a statistical point of view,\nconsidering macrostates (for example, P, V, T) and microstates\n(state of each molecule). The most probable processes are the\nones we observe. They are the ones that increase entropy the\nmost.
