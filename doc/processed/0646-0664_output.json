They differ only in wave-\nlength and frequency.\n(c) X-rays are pure energy. Radio waves are made of fields, not energy.\n(d) Radio waves come from electric currents in an antenna. X-rays are not related\nto electric charge.\n(e) X-rays are made up of particles called photons whereas radio waves are\noscillations in space.\nT\nhe culmination of electromagnetic theory in the nineteenth century was the\nprediction, and the experimental verification, that waves of electromagnetic\nfields could travel through space. This achievement opened a whole new\nworld of communication: first the wireless telegraph, then radio and television,\nand more recently cell phones, remote-control devices, wi-fi, and Bluetooth.\nMost important was the spectacular prediction that light is an electromagnetic\nwave.\nThe theoretical prediction of electromagnetic waves was the work of the\nScottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879; Fig. 22-1), who unified, in one\nmagnificent theory, all the phenomena of electricity and magnetism.\n22\nCONTENTS\n22-1 Changing Electric Fields\nProduce Magnetic Fields;\nMaxwell's Equations\n22-2 Production of\nElectromagnetic Waves\n22-3 Light as an Electromagnetic Wave\nand the Electromagnetic Spectrum\n22-4 Measuring the Speed of Light\n22-5 Energy in EM Waves\n22-6 Momentum Transfer and\nRadiation Pressure\n22-7 Radio and Television;\nWireless Communication\nFIGURE 22-1 James Clerk Maxwell.\n625\n", 'chapter_title': "22-1 Changing Electric Fields Produce Magnetic Fields; Maxwell's Equations"}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': "22-1 Changing Electric Fields Produce\nMagnetic Fields; Maxwell's Equations\nThe development of electromagnetic theory in the early part of the nineteenth\ncentury by Oersted, Ampère, and others was not actually done in terms of electric\nand magnetic fields. The idea of the field was introduced somewhat later by\nFaraday, and was not generally used until Maxwell showed that all electric and\nmagnetic phenomena could be described using only four equations involving elec-\ntric and magnetic fields. These equations, known as Maxwell's equations, are the\nbasic equations for all electromagnetism. They are fundamental in the same sense\nthat Newton's three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation are for\nmechanics. In a sense, they are even more fundamental, because they are consistent\nwith the theory of relativity (Chapter 26), whereas Newton's laws are not. Because\nall of electromagnetism is contained in this set of four equations, Maxwell's equa-\ntions are considered one of the great triumphs of the human intellect.\nAlthough we will not present Maxwell's equations in mathematical form\nsince they involve calculus, we will summarize them here in words. They are:\n(1) a generalized form of Coulomb's law that relates electric field to its source,\nelectric charge (= Gauss's law, Section 16-12);\n(2) a similar law for the magnetic field, except that magnetic field lines are always\ncontinuous-they do not begin or end (as electric field lines do, on charges);\n(3) an electric field is produced by a changing magnetic field (Faraday's law);\n(4) a magnetic field is produced by an electric current (Ampère's law), or by a\nchanging electric field.\nLaw (3) is Faraday's law (see Chapter 21, especially Section 21-4). The first part\nof law (4), that a magnetic field is produced by an electric current, was discovered by\nOersted, and the mathematical relation is given by Ampère's law (Section 20-8).\nBut the second part of law (4) is an entirely new aspect predicted by Maxwell:\nMaxwell argued that if a changing magnetic field produces an electric field, as\ngiven by Faraday's law, then the reverse might be true as well: a changing electric\nfield will produce a magnetic field. This was an hypothesis by Maxwell. It is based\non the idea of symmetry in nature. Indeed, the size of the effect in most cases is so\nsmall that Maxwell recognized it would be difficult to detect it experimentally.\n* Maxwell's Fourth Equation (Ampère's Law Extended)\nTo back up the idea that a changing electric field might produce a magnetic field,\nwe use an indirect argument that goes something like this. According to Ampère's\nlaw (Section 20-8), EB Δ. = μο I. That is, divide any closed path you choose into\nshort segments Al, multiply each segment by the parallel component of the mag-\nnetic field B at that segment, and then sum all these products over the complete\nclosed path. That sum will then equal uo times the total current I that passes\nthrough a surface bounded by the path. When we applied Ampère's law to the\nfield around a straight wire (Section 20-8), we imagined the current as passing\nthrough the circular area enclosed by our circular loop. That area is the flat\nsurface 1 shown in Fig. 22-2. However, we could just as well use the sack-shaped\nsurface 2 in Fig. 22-2 as the surface for Ampère's law because the same current I\npasses through it.\nFIGURE 22-2 Ampère's law\napplied to two different surfaces\nbounded by the same closed path.\nSurface 2\nI\nClosed\npath\nSurface 1\nI\nG\n626 CHAPTER 22 Electromagnetic Waves\n", 'chapter_title': "22-1 Changing Electric Fields Produce Magnetic Fields; Maxwell's Equations"}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': '–\n–\n/+++++++ + + +\n–\nNow consider the closed path for the situation of Fig. 22-3 where a capacitor\nis being discharged. Ampère\'s law works for surface 1 (current I passes through\nsurface 1), but it does not work for surface 2 because no current passes through\nsurface 2. There is a magnetic field around the wire, so the left side of Ampère\'s law\nΣΒΙ ΔΩ = μοι\nis not zero around the circular closed path; yet no current flows through sur-\nface 2, so the right side is zero for surface 2. We seem to have a contradiction of\nAmpère\'s law. There is a magnetic field present in Fig. 22-3, however, only if\ncharge is flowing to or away from the capacitor plates. The changing charge on\nthe plates means that the electric field between the plates is changing in time.\nMaxwell resolved the problem of no current through surface 2 in Fig. 22-3 by\nproposing that the changing electric field between the plates is equivalent to an\nelectric current. He called it a displacement current, ID . An ordinary current I is\nthen called a "conduction current," and Ampère\'s law, as generalized by Maxwell,\nbecomes\nΣΒΙ ΔΩ = μο(1 + ID).\nAmpère\'s law will now apply also for surface 2 in Fig. 22-3, where ID refers to the\nchanging electric field.\nCombining Eq. 17-7 for the charge on a capacitor, Q = CV, with Eq. 17-8,\nC = €, A/d, and with the magnitudes in Eq. 17-4a, V = Ed, we can write\nQ = CV = (€, A/d)(Ed) = €.AE. Then the current ID becomes\nID = A9\n€0\nAt\n=\nAPE\n,\nwhere @F = EA is the electric flux, defined in analogy to magnetic flux\n(Section 21-2). Then, Ampère\'s law becomes\nΣΒΙ ΔΩ = μοΙ + μρέο\nAt\nAPE\n.\n(22-1)\nThis equation embodies Maxwell\'s idea that a magnetic field can be caused not\nonly by a normal electric current, but also by a changing electric field or changing\nelectric flux.\n22-2 Production of\nElectromagnetic Waves\nAccording to Maxwell, a magnetic field will be produced in empty space if there is\na changing electric field. From this, Maxwell derived another startling conclusion.\nIf a changing magnetic field produces an electric field, that electric field is itself\nchanging. This changing electric field will, in turn, produce a magnetic field, which\nwill be changing, and so it too will produce a changing electric field; and so on.\nWhen Maxwell worked with his equations, he found that the net result of these\ninteracting changing fields was a wave of electric and magnetic fields that can\npropagate (travel) through space! We now examine, in a simplified way, how such\nelectromagnetic waves can be produced.\nConsider two conducting rods that will serve as an "antenna" (Fig. 22-4a).\nSuppose these two rods are connected by a switch to the opposite terminals of a\nbattery. When the switch is closed, the upper rod quickly becomes positively charged\nand the lower one negatively charged. Electric field lines are formed as indicated\nby the lines in Fig. 22-4b. While the charges are flowing, a current exists whose\ndirection is indicated by the black arrows. A magnetic field is therefore produced\nnear the antenna. The magnetic field lines encircle the rod-like antenna and there-\nfore, in Fig. 22-4, B points into the page (®) on the right and out of the page (O)\non the left. Now we ask, how far out do these electric and magnetic fields extend?\nIn the static case, the fields would extend outward indefinitely far. However, when\nthe switch in Fig. 22-4 is closed, the fields quickly appear nearby, but it takes time\nfor them to reach distant points. Both electric and magnetic fields store energy,\nand this energy cannot be transferred to distant points at infinite speed.\nSurface 2\nB\n–\nE\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\nClosed\npath\n+\n+ + + +\n+\nI\n–\n+\n–\nI\n–\n–\n–\n–\n+\n–\n–\n–\n+ + + +\n+ +\n–\n–\n–\n–\nSurface 1\nFIGURE 22-3 A capacitor\ndischarging.

In Fig. 22-5a, the connection has just been completed. Charge\nstarts building up, and fields form just as in Fig. 22-4b. The + and - signs in\nFig. 22-5a indicate the net charge on each rod at a given instant. The black arrows\nindicate the direction of the current. The electric field is represented by red lines\nin the plane of the page; and the magnetic field, according to the right-hand rule,\nis into (8) or out of (O) the page in blue. In Fig. 22-5b, the voltage of the ac\ngenerator has reversed in direction; the current is reversed and the new magnetic\nfield is in the opposite direction. Because the new fields have changed direction,\nthe old lines fold back to connect up to some of the new lines and form closed\nloops as shown.+ The old fields, however, don\'t suddenly disappear; they are on\ntheir way to distant points. Indeed, because a changing magnetic field produces\nan electric field, and a changing electric field produces a magnetic field, this\ncombination of changing electric and magnetic fields moving outward is self-\nsupporting, no longer depending on the antenna charges.\nThe fields not far from the antenna, referred to as the near field, become\nquite complicated, but we are not so interested in them. We are mainly interested\nin the fields far from the antenna (they are generally what we detect), which we\nrefer to as the radiation field. The electric field lines form loops, as shown in\nFig. 22-6a, and continue moving outward. The magnetic field lines also form closed\nloops, but are not shown because they are perpendicular to the page. Although the\nlines are shown only on the right of the source, fields also travel in other directions.\nThe field strengths are greatest in directions perpendicular to the oscillating\ncharges; and they drop to zero along the direction of oscillation-above and below\nthe antenna in Fig. 22-6a.\n8\nFIGURE 22-6 (a) The radiation fields (far from the antenna)\nproduced by a sinusoidal signal on the antenna. The red\nclosed loops represent electric field lines. The magnetic field\nlines, perpendicular to the page and represented by blue ®\nand O, also form closed loops. (b) Very far from the antenna,\nthe wave fronts (field lines) are essentially flat over a fairly\nlarge area, and are referred to as plane waves.\n8\n8\n18\n8\nAntenna\n18\n8\n8\nDirection\n8 - of\nwave travel\n.\n8\nO\n(a)\n8\nO\n8\n(b)\n8\nThe magnitudes of both E and B in the radiation field are found to decrease\nwith distance as 1/r. (Compare this to the static electric field given by Coulomb\'s\nlaw where E decreases as 1/r2.) The energy carried by the electromagnetic wave\nis proportional (as for any wave, Chapter 11) to the square of the amplitude,\nE2 or B2, as will be discussed further in Section 22-7, so the intensity of the wave\ndecreases as 1/r2. Thus the energy carried by EM waves follows the inverse\nsquare law just as for sound waves (Eqs. 11-16).\nSeveral things about the radiation field can be noted from Fig. 22-6. First, the\nelectric and magnetic fields at any point are perpendicular to each other, and to the\ndirection of wave travel. Second, we can see that the fields alternate in direction\n(B is into the page at some points and out of the page at others; E points up at\nsome points and down at others). Thus, the field strengths vary from a maximum\nin one direction, to zero, to a maximum in the other direction. The electric and\nmagnetic fields are "in phase": that is, they each are zero at the same points and\nreach their maxima at the same points in space. Finally, very far from the antenna\n(Fig. 22-6b) the field lines are quite flat over a reasonably large area, and the\nwaves are referred to as plane waves.\n*We are considering waves traveling through empty space. There are no charges for lines of È to start\nor stop on, so they form closed loops. Magnetic field lines always form closed loops.\n628 CHAPTER 22 Electromagnetic Waves\n', 'chapter_title': "22-1 Changing Electric Fields Produce Magnetic Fields; Maxwell's Equations"}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': "B\nE\nAy\nB\nx\nz\nB\nIf the source voltage varies sinusoidally, then the electric and magnetic field\nstrengths in the radiation field will also vary sinusoidally. The sinusoidal character\nof the waves is shown in Fig. 22-7, which displays the field directions and magni-\ntudes plotted as a function of position along the direction of wave travel. Notice\nthat B and E are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave travel.\nWe call these waves electromagnetic (EM) waves. They are transverse waves\nbecause the amplitude is perpendicular to the direction of wave travel. However,\nEM waves are always waves of fields, not of matter (like waves on water or a\nrope). Because they are fields, EM waves can propagate in empty space.\nAs we have seen, EM waves are produced by electric charges that are oscil-\nlating, and hence are undergoing acceleration. In fact, we can say in general that\naccelerating electric charges give rise to electromagnetic waves.\nMaxwell derived a formula for the speed of EM waves:\nv = c = E ,\n(22-2)\nwhere c is the special symbol for the speed of electromagnetic waves in empty\nspace, and E and B are the magnitudes of electric and magnetic fields at the same\npoint in space.

In which direction is the wave traveling? (a) South,\n(b) west, (c) east, (d) down, (e) not enough information. [See Fig. 22-7.]\n22-3 Light as an Electromagnetic Wave\nand the Electromagnetic Spectrum\nMaxwell's prediction that EM waves should exist was startling. Equally remarkable\nwas the speed at which EM waves were predicted to travel-3.00 × 108 m/s,\nthe same as the measured speed of light.\nLight had been shown some 60 years before Maxwell's work to behave like\na wave (we'll discuss this in Chapter 24). But nobody knew what kind of wave it\nwas. What is it that is oscillating in a light wave? Maxwell, on the basis of the\ncalculated speed of EM waves, argued that light must be an electromagnetic wave.\nThis idea soon came to be generally accepted by scientists, but not fully until\nafter EM waves were experimentally detected. EM waves were first generated\nand detected experimentally by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894) in 1887, eight years\nafter Maxwell's death. Hertz used a spark-gap apparatus in which charge was\nmade to rush back and forth for a short time, generating waves whose frequency\nwas about 109 Hz. He detected them some distance away using a loop of wire in\nwhich an emf was induced when a changing magnetic field passed through.\nSECTION 22-3 629\n", 'chapter_title': "22-1 Changing Electric Fields Produce Magnetic Fields; Maxwell's Equations"}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'These waves were later shown to travel at the speed of light, 3.00 × 108 m/s,\nand to exhibit all the characteristics of light such as reflection, refraction, and\ninterference. The only difference was that they were not visible. Hertz\'s experiment\nwas a strong confirmation of Maxwell\'s theory.\nThe wavelengths of visible light were measured in the first decade of the nine-\nteenth century, long before anyone imagined that light was an electromagnetic\nwave. The wavelengths were found to lie between 4.0 × 10-7 m and 7.5 × 10-7 m,\nor 400 nm to 750 nm (1 nm = 10-9m). The frequencies of visible light can be\nfound using Eq. 11-12, which we rewrite here:\nc = Af,\n(22-4)\nwhere f and À are the frequency and wavelength, respectively, of the wave. Here,\nc is the speed of light, 3.00 × 108 m/s; it gets the special symbol c because of its\nuniversality for all EM waves in free space. Equation 22-4 tells us that the\nfrequencies of visible light are between 4.0 × 1014 Hz and 7.5 × 1014 Hz. (Recall\nthat 1 Hz = 1 cycle per second = 1 s-1.)\nBut visible light is only one kind of EM wave. As we have seen, Hertz\nproduced EM waves of much lower frequency, about 109 Hz. These are now called\nradio waves, because frequencies in this range are used to transmit radio and TV\nsignals. Electromagnetic waves, or EM radiation as we sometimes call it, have\nbeen produced or detected over a wide range of frequencies. They are usually\ncategorized as shown in Fig. 22-8, which is known as the electromagnetic spectrum.\nWavelength (m)\n3 m\n3 × 104 m\nRadio waves\n60 Hz\n(ac current)\n102\n104\nAM\nradio\n3 × 10-4 m\n3 × 10-8 m\n3 × 10-12 m\nInfrared\nUltraviolet\nGamma rays\nMicrowaves\n(e.g., radar)\nVisible light\nX-rays\nFM TV\nCellular\nphones\nTV\nCh7 &up\nCh2-6 V V + +\nSatellite\nTV\n106\n108\nFrequency (Hz)\nFIGURE 22-8\nElectromagnetic spectrum.\n1010\n1012\n1014\n1016\n1018\n1020\nÀ=7.5×10-7m\n4.0× 10-7m\nf= 4x 1014 Hz\n7.5 × 1014 Hz\nVisible light\nRadio waves and microwaves can be produced in the laboratory using elec-\ntronic equipment (Fig. 22-5). Higher-frequency waves are very difficult to produce\nelectronically. These and other types of EM waves are produced in natural processes,\nas emission from atoms, molecules, and nuclei (more on this later). EM waves can be\nproduced by the acceleration of electrons or other charged particles, such as\nelectrons in the antenna of Fig. 22-5. X-rays have very short wavelengths\n(and very high frequencies), and they are produced (Chapters 25 and 28) when\nfast-moving electrons are rapidly decelerated upon striking a metal target. Even\nthe visible light emitted by an ordinary incandescent bulb is due to electrons\nundergoing acceleration within the hot filament.\nEXERCISE B Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 625, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\nWe will meet various types of EM waves later. However, it is worth mentioning\nhere that infrared (IR) radiation (EM waves whose frequency is just less than that\nof visible light) is mainly responsible for the heating effect of the Sun. The Sun\nemits not only visible light but substantial amounts of IR and UV (ultraviolet) as\nwell. The molecules of our skin tend to "resonate" at infrared frequencies, so it is\nthese that are preferentially absorbed and thus warm us. We humans experience\nEM waves differently depending on their wavelengths: Our eyes detect wavelengths\nbetween about 4 × 10-7 m and 7.5 × 10-7 m (visible light), whereas our skin detects\nlonger wavelengths (IR). Many EM wavelengths we don\'t detect directly at all.\n630 CHAPTER 22\n', 'chapter_title': "22-1 Changing Electric Fields Produce Magnetic Fields; Maxwell's Equations"}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Light and other electromagnetic waves travel at a speed of 3 × 108 m/s.\nCompare this to sound, which travels (see Chapter 12) at a speed of about 300 m/s\nin air, a million times slower; or to typical freeway speeds of a car, 30 m/s (100 km/h,\nor 60 mi/h), 10 million times slower than light.

Galileo\nmeasured the time between the flash of his lamp and when he received the light\nfrom his assistant's lamp. The time was so short that Galileo concluded it merely\nrepresented human reaction time, and that the speed of light must be extremely\nhigh.\nThe first successful determination that the speed of light is finite was made\nby the Danish astronomer Ole Roemer (1644-1710). Roemer had noted that the\ncarefully measured orbital period of Io, a moon of Jupiter with an average period\nof 42.5 h, varied slightly, depending on the relative position of Earth and Jupiter.\nHe attributed this variation in the apparent period to the change in distance\nbetween the Earth and Jupiter during one of Io's periods, and the time it took\nlight to travel the extra distance. Roemer concluded that the speed of light-\nthough great-is finite.\nSince then a number of techniques have been used to measure the speed of\nlight. Among the most important were those carried out by the American Albert A.\nMichelson (1852-1931). Michelson used the rotating mirror apparatus diagrammed\n632 CHAPTER 22 Electromagnetic Waves\n", 'chapter_title': "22-1 Changing Electric Fields Produce Magnetic Fields; Maxwell's Equations"}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': "in Fig. 22-10 for a series of high-precision experiments carried out from 1880 to\nthe 1920s. Light from a source would hit one face of a rotating eight-sided mirror.\nThe reflected light traveled to a stationary mirror a large distance away and back\nagain as shown. If the rotating mirror was turning at just the right rate, the return-\ning beam of light would reflect from one face of the mirror into a small telescope\nthrough which the observer looked. If the speed of rotation was only slightly\ndifferent, the beam would be deflected to one side and would not be seen by the\nobserver. From the required speed of the rotating mirror and the known distance\nto the stationary mirror, the speed of light could be calculated. In the 1920s,\nMichelson set up the rotating mirror on the top of Mt. Wilson in southern California\nand the stationary mirror on Mt. Baldy (Mt. San Antonio) 35 km away. He later\nmeasured the speed of light in vacuum using a long evacuated tube.\nObserver\nEight-sided\nrotating\nmirror\nStationary\nmirror\n(Mt. Baldy)\nLight\nsource\n(Mt.

This means that the standard for length, the meter,\nis no longer defined separately. Instead, as we noted in Section 1-5, the meter is\nnow formally defined as the distance light travels in vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of\na second.\nWe usually round off c to\nc = 3.00 × 108 m/s\nwhen extremely precise results are not required. In air, the speed is only slightly\nless.\n22-5 Energy in EM Waves\nElectromagnetic waves carry energy from one region of space to another. This\nenergy is associated with the moving electric and magnetic fields. In Section 17-9,\nwe saw that the energy density uE (J/m3) stored in an electric field E is UE = 260 E2\n(Eq. 17-11). The energy density stored in a magnetic field B, as we discussed in\nSection 21-11, is given by u B = 2 B2/uo (Eq. 21-10). Thus, the total energy stored\nper unit volume in a region of space where there is an electromagnetic wave is\nU = Ug + UB = == 0 E2 + 1 B2\n2 Mo\n(22-5)\n.\nIn this equation, E and B represent the electric and magnetic field strengths of\nthe wave at any instant in a small region of space.

The force per\nunit area exerted by the waves is called radiation pressure, and its existence was\npredicted by Maxwell.

This result would apply if the spacecraft was far\nfrom the Earth so the Earth\'s gravitational force is small compared to 10 N.\nNOTE A large sail providing a small force over a long time could result in a lot\nof motion. [Gravity due to the Sun and planets has been ignored, but in reality\nwould have to be considered.]\nAlthough you cannot directly feel the effects of radiation pressure, the\nphenomenon is quite dramatic when applied to atoms irradiated by a finely\nfocused laser beam. An atom has a mass on the order of 10-27 kg, and a laser\nbeam can deliver energy at a rate of 1000 W/m2. This is the same intensity used in\nExample 22-5, but here a radiation pressure of 10-6 N/m2 would be very signif-\nicant on a molecule whose mass might be 10-23 to 10-26 kg. It is possible to move\natoms and molecules around by steering them with a laser beam, in a device\ncalled optical tweezers. Optical tweezers have some remarkable applications.\nThey are of great interest to biologists, especially since optical tweezers can manip-\nulate live microorganisms, and components within a cell, without damaging them.\nOptical tweezers have been used to measure the elastic properties of DNA by\npulling each end of the molecule with such a laser "tweezers."\n22-7 Radio and Television;\nWireless Communication\nElectromagnetic waves offer the possibility of transmitting information over long\ndistances. Among the first to realize this and put it into practice was Guglielmo\nMarconi (1874-1937) who, in the 1890s, invented and developed wireless commu-\nnication. With it, messages could be sent at the speed of light without the use of\nwires. The first signals were merely long and short pulses that could be translated\ninto words by a code, such as the "dots" and "dashes" of the Morse code: they\nwere digital wireless, believe it or not. In 1895 Marconi sent wireless signals a\nkilometer or two in Italy. By 1901 he had sent test signals 3000 km across the\nocean from Newfoundland, Canada, to Cornwall, England (Fig. 22-12). In 1903\nhe sent the first practical commercial messages from Cape Cod, Massachusetts,\nto England: the London Times printed news items sent from its New York\ncorrespondent. 1903 was also the year of the first powered airplane flight by the\nWright brothers. The hallmarks of the modern age-wireless communication and\nflight-date from the same year. Our modern world of wireless communication,\nincluding radio, television, cordless phones, cell phones, Bluetooth, wi-fi, and satellite\ncommunication, are based on Marconi\'s pioneering work.\nElectromagnetic Waves\n', 'chapter_title': "22-1 Changing Electric Fields Produce Magnetic Fields; Maxwell's Equations"}, {'page_number': 13, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The next decade saw the development of vacuum tubes. Out of this early\nwork radio and television were born. We now discuss briefly (1) how radio and\nTV signals are transmitted, and (2) how they are received at home.\nThe process by which a radio station transmits information (words and music)\nis outlined in Fig. 22-13. The audio (sound) information is changed into an elec-\ntrical signal of the same frequencies by, say, a microphone, a laser, or a magnetic\nread/write head. This electrical signal is called an audiofrequency (AF) signal,\nbecause the frequencies are in the audio range (20 to 20,000 Hz). The signal is ampli-\nfied electronically and is then mixed with a radio-frequency (RF) signal called its\ncarrier frequency, which represents that station. AM radio stations have carrier\nfrequencies from about 530 kHz to 1700 kHz. For example, "710 on your dial"\nmeans a station whose carrier frequency is 710 kHz. FM radio stations have much\nhigher carrier frequencies, between 88 MHz and 108 MHz. The carrier frequencies\nfor broadcast TV stations in the United States lie between 54 MHz and 72 MHZ,\nbetween 76 MHz and 88 MHz, between 174 MHz and 216 MHz, and between\n470 MHz and 698 MHz.

In\namplitude modulation (AM), the amplitude of the high-frequency carrier wave\nis made to vary in proportion to the amplitude of the audio signal, as shown in\nFig. 22-14. It is called "amplitude modulation" because the amplitude of the car-\nrier is altered ("modulate" means to change or alter). In frequency modulation (FM),\nthe frequency of the carrier wave is made to change in proportion to the audio\nsignal\'s amplitude, as shown in Fig. 22-15. The mixed signal is amplified further\nand sent to the transmitting antenna (Fig. 22-13), where the complex mixture\nof frequencies is sent out in the form of EM waves. In digital communication,\nthe signal is put into digital form (Section 17-10) which modulates the carrier.\nA television transmitter works in a similar way, using FM for audio and AM\nfor video; both audio and video signals are mixed with carrier frequencies.\nProgram (audio)\nCarrier\nTotal signal (AM)\nFIGURE 22-14 In amplitude modulation (AM),\nthe amplitude of the carrier signal is made\nto vary in proportion to the audio signal\'s\namplitude.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nAM and FM\nProgram (audio)\nCarrier\nWWW\nTotal signal (FM)\nFIGURE 22-15 In frequency modulation (FM),\nthe frequency of the carrier signal is made\nto change in proportion to the audio signal\'s\namplitude.

A simple radio receiver is diagrammed in Fig. 22-16. The EM\nwaves sent out by all stations are received by the antenna. The signals the antenna\ndetects and sends to the receiver are very small and contain frequencies from many\ndifferent stations. The receiver uses a resonant LC circuit (Section 21-15) to select\nout a particular RF frequency (actually a narrow range of frequencies) correspond-\ning to a particular station. A simple way of tuning a station is shown in Fig. 22-17.\nA particular station is "tuned in" by adjusting C and/or L so that the resonant\nfrequency of the circuit (fo = 1/(2m VLC), Eq. 21-19) equals that of the station\'s\ncarrier frequency. The signal, containing both audio and carrier frequencies, next\ngoes to the demodulator, or detector (Fig. 22-16), where "demodulation" takes\nplace-that is, the audio signal is separated from the RF carrier frequency. The\naudio signal is amplified and sent to a loudspeaker or headphones.\nModern receivers have more stages than those shown. Various means are used\nto increase the sensitivity and selectivity (ability to detect weak signals and dis-\ntinguish them from other stations), and to minimize distortion of the original\nsignal.+\nA television receiver does similar things to both the audio and the video signals.\nThe audio signal goes finally to the loudspeaker, and the video signal to the monitor\nscreen, such as an LCD (Sections 17-11 and 24-11).\nAntenna rod\nB\nAI Current produced\nby electric field\nB\nE\nB\nE\nB\nE\nLoop\nantenna\nB\nInduced\ncurrent\nB\nEM wave\nTo receiver\ndirection\nB\nB\n(a)\nB\nTo\nreceiver\n(TV set)\n(b)\nFIGURE 22-18 Antennas.

A second type\nof antenna consists of a tubular coil of wire which detects the magnetic field of the\nwave: the changing B field induces an emf in the coil (Fig. 22-18b). A satellite dish\n(Fig. 22-19) consists of a parabolic reflector that focuses the EM waves onto a\n"horn," similar to a concave mirror telescope (Fig. 25-22).\n*For FM stereo broadcasting, two signals are carried by the carrier wave. One signal contains frequencies\nup to about 15 kHz, which includes most audio frequencies. The other signal includes the same range\nof frequencies, but 19 kHz is added to it. A stereo receiver subtracts this 19,000-Hz signal and distributes\nthe two signals to the left and right channels. The first signal consists of the sum of left and right channels\n(L + R), so monophonic radios (one speaker) detect all the sound. The second signal is the difference\nbetween left and right (L - R). Hence a stereo receiver must add and subtract the two signals to get\npure left and right signals for each channel.\n638 CHAPTER 22 Electromagnetic Waves\n', 'chapter_title': "22-1 Changing Electric Fields Produce Magnetic Fields; Maxwell's Equations"}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 22-7\nTuning a station.

FM antennas are typically 1.5 m long, or about\na half wavelength. This length is chosen so that the antenna reacts in a resonant\nfashion and thus is more sensitive to FM frequencies. AM radio antennas would\nhave to be very long and impractical to be either 2 1 or 4 1.\nOther EM Wave Communications\nThe various regions of the radio-wave spectrum are assigned by governmental\nagencies for various purposes. Besides those mentioned above, there are "bands"\nassigned for use by ships, airplanes, police, military, amateurs, satellites and space,\nand radar. Cell phones, for example, are complete radio transmitters and receivers.\nIn the U.S., CDMA cell phones function on two different bands: 800 MHz and\n1900 MHZ (= 1.9 GHZ). Europe, Asia, and much of the rest of the world use a dif-\nferent system: the international standard called GSM (Global System for Mobile\nCommunication), on 900-MHz and 1800-MHz bands. The U.S. now also has the\nGSM option (at 850 MHz and 1.9 GHZ), as does much of the rest of the Americas.\nA 700-MHz band is being made available for cell phones (it used to carry TV\nbroadcast channels, no longer used). Radio-controlled toys (cars, sailboats,\nrobotic animals, etc.) can use various frequencies from 27 MHz to 75 MHz.\nAutomobile remote entry (keyless) may operate around 300 MHz or 400 MHZ.\nCable TV channels are carried as electromagnetic waves along a coaxial cable\n(Fig. 22-9) rather than being broadcast and received through the "air." The channels\nare in the same part of the EM spectrum, hundreds of MHz, but some are at\nfrequencies not available for TV broadcast. Digital satellite TV and radio are carried\nin the microwave portion of the spectrum (12 to 14 GHz and 2.3 GHZ, respectively).\nWireless from the Moon\nIn 1969, astronauts first landed on the Moon. It was shown live on television\n(Fig. 22-20). The transmitting TV camera can be seen in the Chapter-Opening\nphoto, page 625. At that time, someone pointed out that Columbus and other\nearly navigators could have imagined that humans might one day reach the\nMoon. But they would never have believed possible that moving images could be\nsent from the Moon to the Earth through empty space.\nSummary\nJames Clerk Maxwell synthesized an elegant theory in which\nall electric and magnetic phenomena could be described using\nfour equations, now called Maxwell\'s equations. They are based\non earlier ideas, but Maxwell added one more-that a changing\nelectric field produces a magnetic field.\nMaxwell\'s theory predicted that transverse electromagnetic\n(EM) waves would be produced by accelerating electric charges,\nand these waves would propagate (move) through space at the\nspeed of light:\nc =\nVEOMO\n1\n= 3.00 ×108 m/s.\n(22-3)\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nCell phones, remote controls,\ncable TV, satellite TV and radio\nFIGURE 22-20 The first person on\nthe Moon, Neil Armstrong, July 20,\n1969, pointed out "One small step for\na man, one giant leap for mankind."\nThe oscillating electric and magnetic fields in an EM wave\nare perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propa-\ngation.
