We say that heat "flows" from the hot\nburner to the cold water. When two objects at different temperatures\nare put in contact, heat spontaneously flows from the hotter one to the colder one.\nThe spontaneous flow of heat is in the direction tending to equalize the tempera-\nture. If the two objects are kept in contact long enough for their temperatures to\nbecome equal, the objects are said to be in thermal equilibrium, and there is no\nfurther heat flow between them. For example, when a fever thermometer is first\nplaced in your mouth, heat flows from your mouth to the thermometer. When\nthe thermometer reaches the same temperature as the inside of your mouth, the\nthermometer and your mouth are then in equilibrium, and no more heat flows.\nHeat and temperature are often confused. They are very different concepts,\nand in this Chapter we will make a clear distinction between them. We begin by\ndefining and using the concept of heat. We also discuss how heat is used in\ncalorimetry, how it is involved in changes of state of matter, and the processes of\nheat transfer-conduction, convection, and radiation.\n390\n', 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer\nWe use the term "heat" in everyday life as if we knew what we meant. But the\nterm is often used inconsistently, so it is important for us to define heat clearly,\nand to clarify the phenomena and concepts related to heat.\nWe commonly speak of the flow of heat-heat flows from a stove burner to a\npot of soup, from the Sun to the Earth, from a person\'s mouth into a fever ther-\nmometer. Heat flows spontaneously from an object at higher temperature to one\nat lower temperature. Indeed, an eighteenth-century model of heat pictured heat\nflow as movement of a fluid substance called caloric. However, the caloric fluid\ncould never be detected. In the nineteenth century, it was found that the various\nphenomena associated with heat could be described consistently using a new\nmodel that views heat as being akin to work, as we will discuss in a moment. First\nwe note that a common unit for heat, still in use today, is named after caloric. It is\ncalled the calorie (cal) and is defined as the amount of heat necessary to raise the\ntemperature of 1 gram of water by 1 Celsius degree. [To be precise, the particular\ntemperature range from 14.5°℃ to 15.5°C is specified because the heat required\nis very slightly different at different temperatures. The difference is less than 1%\nover the range 0 to 100℃, and we will ignore it for most purposes.] More often\nused than the calorie is the kilocalorie (kcal), which is 1000 calories. Thus 1 kcal\nis the heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 C°. Often a kilo-\ncalorie is called a Calorie (with a capital C), and this Calorie (or the kJ) is used to\nspecify the energy value of food. In the British system of units, heat is measured\nin British thermal units (Btu). One Btu is defined as the heat needed to raise\nthe temperature of 1 lb of water by 1 Fº. It can be shown (Problem 5) that\n1 Btu = 0.252 kcal = 1056 J. Also, one therm is 105 Btu.\nThe idea that heat is related to energy transfer was pursued by a number of\nscientists in the 1800s, particularly by an English brewer, James Prescott Joule\n(1818-1889). Joule and others performed a number of experiments that were\ncrucial for establishing our present-day view that heat, like work, represents a\ntransfer of energy. One of Joule\'s experiments is shown (simplified) in Fig. 14-1.\nThe falling weight causes the paddle wheel to turn. The friction between the\nwater and the paddle wheel causes the temperature of the water to rise slightly\n(barely measurable, in fact, by Joule). The same temperature rise could also be\nobtained by heating the water on a hot stove. In this and many other experiments\n(some involving electrical energy), Joule determined that a given amount of\nwork done was always equivalent to a particular amount of heat input. Quantita-\ntively, 4.186 joules (J) of work was found to be equivalent to 1 calorie (cal) of heat.\nThis is known as the mechanical equivalent of heat:\nCAUTION\nHeat is not a fluid\nWeight\nFIGURE 14-1 Joule\'s experiment\non the mechanical equivalent of heat.\n[The work is transformed into internal\nenergy (Section 14-2).]\n4.186 J = 1 cal;\n4.186 kJ = 1 kcal.\nAs a result of these and other experiments, scientists came to interpret heat\nnot as a substance, and not exactly as a form of energy. Rather, heat refers to a\ntransfer of energy: when heat flows from a hot object to a cooler one, it is energy\nthat is being transferred from the hot to the cold object. Thus, heat is energy\ntransferred from one object to another because of a difference in temperature. In\nSI units, the unit for heat, as for any form of energy, is the joule. Nonetheless,\ncalories and kcal are still sometimes used. Today the calorie is defined in terms\nof the joule (via the mechanical equivalent of heat, above), rather than in terms of\nthe properties of water, as given previously. The latter is still handy to remember:\n1 cal raises 1 g of water by 1 C°, or 1 kcal raises 1 kg of water by 1 Co.\nCAUTION\nHeat is energy transferred\nbecause of a AT\nSECTION 14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer 391\n', 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 3, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'PHYSICS APPLIED\nWorking off Calories\nCAUTION\nDistinguish heat from\ninternal energy and from\ntemperature\nCAUTION\nDirection of heat flow\ndepends on temperatures\n(not on amount of internal energy)\nEXAMPLE 14-1\nESTIMATE\nWorking off the extra Calories. Suppose you\nthrow caution to the wind and eat 500 Calories of ice cream and cake. To compen-\nsate, you want to do an equivalent amount of work climbing stairs or a mountain.\nHow much total height must you climb?\nAPPROACH The work W you need to do in climbing stairs equals the change in\ngravitational potential energy: W = APE = mgh, where h is the vertical height\nclimbed. For this estimate, let us approximate your mass as m ~ 60 kg.\nSOLUTION 500 food Calories is 500 kcal, which in joules is\n(500 kcal)(4.186 × 103 J/kcal) = 2.1 × 106 J.\nThe work done to climb a vertical height h is W = mgh. We solve for h:\nh = =\nW\n=\n2.1 × 106 J\n: 3600 m.\nmg\n(60 kg)(9.80 m/s2)\nThis is a huge elevation change (over 11,000 ft).\nNOTE The human body does not transform food energy with 100% efficiency-\nit is more like 20% efficient. As we shall discuss in the next Chapter, some\nenergy is always "wasted," so you would actually have to climb only about\n(0.2)(3600 m) ~ 700 m, which is more reasonable (about 2300 ft of elevation gain).\n14-2 Internal Energy\nThe sum total of all the energy of all the molecules in an object is called its\ninternal energy. (Sometimes thermal energy is used to mean the same thing.) We\nintroduce the concept of internal energy now since it will help clarify ideas about heat.\nDistinguishing Temperature, Heat, and Internal Energy\nUsing the kinetic theory, we can make a clear distinction between temperature,\nheat, and internal energy. Temperature (in kelvins) is a measure of the average\nkinetic energy of individual molecules (Eq. 13-8). Internal energy refers to the\ntotal energy of all the molecules within the object. (Thus two equal-mass hot ingots of\niron may have the same temperature, but two of them have twice as much internal\nenergy as one does.) Heat, finally, refers to a transfer of energy from one object\nto another because of a difference in temperature.\nNotice that the direction of heat flow between two objects depends on their\ntemperatures, not on how much internal energy each has. Thus, if 50 g of water at\n30°C is placed in contact (or mixed) with 200 g of water at 25℃, heat flows from\nthe water at 30°℃ to the water at 25℃ even though the internal energy of the 25℃\nwater is much greater because there is so much more of it.\nInternal Energy of an Ideal Gas\nLet us calculate the internal energy of n moles of an ideal monatomic (one atom\nper molecule) gas. The internal energy, U, is the sum of the translational kinetic\nenergies of all the atoms. This sum is equal to the average kinetic energy per mol-\necule times the total number of molecules, N:\nU = N(2mv2).\nUsing Eq. 13-8, KE = {mv2 = 2kT, we can write this as\nU = 2NKT\nor (recall Section 13-8)\nU = 2nRT,\ninternal energy of\nd\n(14-1)\nideal monatomic gas\nwhere n is the number of moles. Thus, the internal energy of an ideal gas depends\nonly on temperature and the number of moles (or molecules) of gas.\n392 CHAPTER 14 Heat\n', 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'If the gas molecules contain more than one atom, then the rotational and\nvibrational energy of the molecules (Fig. 14-2) must also be taken into account.\nThe internal energy will be greater at a given temperature than for a monatomic\ngas, but it will still be a function only of temperature for an ideal gas.\nThe internal energy of real gases also depends mainly on temperature, but\nwhere real gases deviate from ideal gas behavior, their internal energy depends\nalso somewhat on pressure and volume (due to atomic potential energy).\nThe internal energy of liquids and solids is quite complicated, for it includes\nelectrical potential energy associated with the forces (or "chemical" bonds) between\natoms and molecules.\n14-3 Specific Heat\nIf heat flows into an object, the object\'s temperature rises (assuming no phase\nchange). But how much does the temperature rise? That depends. As early as the\neighteenth century, experimenters had recognized that the amount of heat Q\nrequired to change the temperature of a given material is proportional to the mass m\nof the material present and to the temperature change AT. This remarkable sim-\nplicity in nature can be expressed in the equation\nQ = mc AT,\n(14-2)\nwhere c is a quantity characteristic of the material called its specific heat.\nBecause c = Q/(m AT), specific heat is specified in units of J/kg · C° (the proper\nSI unit) or kcal/kg·C°. For water at 15℃ and a constant pressure of 1 atm,\nc = 4.186 × 103 J/kg · C° or 1.00 kcal/kg . C°, since, by definition of the cal and\nthe joule, it takes 1 kcal of heat to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1 Co.\nTable 14-1 gives the values of specific heat for other substances at 20°℃. The values\nof c depend to some extent on temperature (as well as slightly on pressure), but\nfor temperature changes that are not too great, c can often be considered constant.\nEXAMPLE 14-2\nHow heat transferred depends on specific heat. (a) How\nmuch heat input is needed to raise the temperature of an empty 20-kg vat made of\niron from 10℃ to 90°C? (b) What if the vat is filled with 20 kg of water?\nAPPROACH We apply Eq. 14-2 to the different materials involved.\nSOLUTION (a) Our system is the iron vat alone. From Table 14-1, the specific\nheat of iron is 450 J/kg · C°. The change in temperature is (90℃ - 10℃) = 80 Cº.\nThus,\nQvat = mc AT = (20 kg)(450 J/kg · C°)(80 C°) = 7.2 × 105 J = 720 kJ.\n(b) Our system is the vat plus the water. The water alone would require\nQw = mc AT = (20 kg)(4186 J/kg · C°)(80 C°) = 6.7 × 106 J = 6700kJ,\nor almost 10 times what an equal mass of iron requires. The total, for the vat\nplus the water, is 720 kJ + 6700 kJ = 7400 kJ.\nNOTE In (b), the iron vat and the water underwent the same temperature\nchange, AT = 80 C°, but their specific heats are different.\nIf the iron vat in part (a) of Example 14-2 had been cooled from 90℃ to 10℃,\n720 kJ of heat would have flowed out of the iron. In other words, Eq. 14-2 is valid for\nheat flow either in or out, with a corresponding increase or decrease in temperature.\nWe saw in part (b) of Example 14-2 that water requires almost 10 times as\nmuch heat as an equal mass of iron to make the same temperature change. Water\nhas one of the highest specific heats of all substances, which makes it an ideal\nsubstance for hot-water space-heating systems and other uses that require a min-\nimal drop in temperature for a given amount of heat transfer.

You accidentally\nlet an empty iron frying pan get very hot on the stove (200℃ or even more).\nWhat happens when you dunk it into a few inches of cool water in the bottom\nof the sink? Will the final temperature be midway between the initial temperatures\nof the water and pan? Will the water start boiling? Assume the mass of water is\nroughly the same as the mass of the frying pan.\nRESPONSE Experience may tell you that the water warms up-perhaps by as\nmuch as 10 or 20 degrees. The water doesn\'t come close to boiling. The water\'s\ntemperature increase is a lot less than the frying pan\'s temperature decrease.\nWhy? Because the mass of water is roughly equal to that of the pan, and iron\nhas a specific heat nearly 10 times smaller than that of water (Table 14-1). As\nheat leaves the frying pan and enters the water, the iron pan\'s temperature\nchange will be about 10 times greater than that of the water. If, instead, you let a few\ndrops of water fall onto the hot pan, that very small mass of water will sizzle and boil\naway (the pan\'s mass may be hundreds of times larger than that of the water drops).\nEXERCISE A Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 390, and answer it again\nnow. Try to explain why you may have answered differently the first time.\n*\n\'Specific Heats for Gases\nSpecific heats for gases are more complicated than for solids and liquids, which\nchange in volume only slightly with a change in temperature. Gases change\nstrongly in volume with a change in temperature at constant pressure, as we saw\nin Chapter 13 with the gas laws; or, if kept at constant volume, the pressure in a\ngas changes strongly with temperature. The specific heat of a gas depends very\nmuch on how the process of changing its temperature is carried out. Most com-\nmonly, we deal with the specific heats of gases kept (a) at constant pressure (cp)\nor (b) at constant volume (cv). Some values are given in Table 14-2, where we\nsee that cp is always greater than cy. For liquids and solids, this distinction is\nusually negligible.

Everything else in the\nuniverse is its "environment" (or the "surroundings"). There are several cate-\ngories of systems. A closed system is one for which no mass enters or leaves (but\nenergy may be exchanged with the environment). In an open system, mass may\nenter or leave (as may energy). Many (idealized) systems we study in physics\nare closed systems. But many systems, including plants and animals, are open\nsystems since they exchange materials (food, oxygen, waste products) with the\nenvironment. A closed system is said to be isolated if no energy in any form\n(as well as no mass) passes across its boundaries; otherwise it is not isolated.\nA perfectly isolated system is an ideal, but we often try to set up a system that\ncan be closely approximated as an isolated system (preferably one we can deal with\nfairly easily). When different parts of an isolated system are at different tempera-\ntures, heat will flow (energy is transferred) from the part at higher temperature to\nthe part at lower temperature-that is, within the system-until thermal equilibrium\nis reached, meaning the entire system is at the same temperature. For an isolated\nsystem, no energy is transferred into or out of it. So we can apply conservation of energy\nto such an isolated system. A simple intuitive way to set up a conservation of energy\nequation is to write that the heat lost by one part of the system is equal to the heat\ngained by the other part:\nheat lost = heat gained\n[isolated system]\nor\nenergy out of one part = energy into another part.\n[isolated system]\n394 CHAPTER 14 Heat\n', 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 14-4\nThe cup cools the tea.

We can use the specific heat equation, Eq. 14-2, to determine how the\nheat flow is related to the temperature changes.\nSOLUTION Because tea is mainly water, we can take its specific heat as\n4186 J/kg .

Its much\ngreater change in temperature (compared with that of the tea water) is due to\nits much smaller specific heat compared to that of water.\nNOTE In this calculation, the AT (of Eq. 14-2, Q = mc AT) is a positive quan-\ntity on both sides of our conservation of energy equation.

To make such measurements, a calorimeter is used; a simple water\ncalorimeter is shown in Fig. 14-4. It is very important that the calorimeter be well\ninsulated so that almost no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. One impor-\ntant use of the calorimeter is in the determination of specific heats of substances.\nIn the technique known as the "method of mixtures," a sample of a substance is\nheated to a high temperature, which is accurately measured, and then quickly\nplaced in the cool water of the calorimeter. The heat lost by the sample will be\ngained by the water and the calorimeter cup. By measuring the final temperature\nof the mixture, the specific heat can be calculated, as illustrated in the following\nExample.\nEXAMPLE 14-5\nUnknown specific heat determined by calorimetry. An\nengineer wishes to determine the specific heat of a new metal alloy. A 0.150-kg\nsample of the alloy is heated to 540℃. It is then quickly placed in 0.400 kg of\nwater at 10.0°℃, which is contained in a 0.200-kg aluminum calorimeter cup. The\nfinal temperature of the system is 30.5℃. Calculate the specific heat of the alloy.\nAPPROACH We apply conservation of energy to our system, which we take to\nbe the alloy sample, the water, and the calorimeter cup. We assume this system\nis isolated, and apply Eq. 14-3, EQ = 0.\nSOLUTION Each term is of the form Q = mc(Tf - Ti). Thus ≥Q = 0 gives\nmaca ATa + mw Cw ATw + mcal Ccal ATcal = 0\nwhere the subscripts a, w, and cal refer to the alloy, water, and calorimeter,\nrespectively, and each AT is the final temperature (30.5℃) minus the initial\ntemperature for each object. When we put in values and use Table 14-1, this\nequation becomes\n(0.150 kg)(ca)(30.5℃ - 540℃) + (0.400 kg)(4186 J/kg ·C°)(30.5℃ - 10.0℃)\n+ (0.200 kg) (900 J/kg · Cº)(30.5℃ - 10.0℃) = 0,\nor\n-(76.4 kg · C°) ca + 34,300 J + 3690 J = 0.\nSolving for ca we obtain:\nCa = 497 J/kg . C° ~ 500 J/kg . Co.\nNOTE We rounded off because we have ignored any heat transferred to the\nthermometer and the stirrer (which is used to quicken the heat transfer process\nand thus reduce heat loss to the outside). To take them into account we would\nhave to add (small) additional terms to the equation.\nIn all Examples and Problems of this sort, be sure to include all objects that\ngain or lose heat (within reason). For simplicity, we have ignored very small masses,\nsuch as the thermometer and the stirrer, which will affect the energy balance only\nvery slightly.\nBomb Calorimeter\nA bomb calorimeter is used to measure the thermal energy released when a\nsubstance burns (including foods) to determine their Calorie content. A carefully\nweighed sample of the substance, with an excess amount of oxygen, is placed in a\nsealed container (the "bomb"). The bomb is placed in the water of the calorimeter\nand a fine wire passing into the bomb is then heated to ignite the mixture.\nThe Calorie content of foods determined in this way can be unreliable because our\nbodies may not metabolize all the available energy (which would be excreted).\nCareful measurements and calculations need to take this into account.\n396 CHAPTER 14 Heat\n', 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Water and steam\nWater vapor (steam)\n120 +\n100 +\n80 +\n60\n+\nTemperature (℃)\n40\n-\n20\n1\n0\n-\nWater\nand\n-20\n+\nIce\nice\n-40\n0 20\nWater\n(all liquid)\n100\n200\n300\n400\nHeat added (kcal)\n500\n600\n14-5 Latent Heat\nWhen a material changes phase from solid to liquid, or from liquid to gas (see also\nSection 13-11), a certain amount of energy is involved in this change of phase.\nFor example, let us trace what happens when a 1.0-kg block of ice at -40℃\nis heated at a slow steady rate until all the ice has changed to water, then the\n(liquid) water is heated to 100°℃ and changed to steam, and heated further\nabove 100°C, all at 1 atm pressure.

After about 40 kcal has been added at 0°C, half the ice remains and half\nhas changed to water. After about 80 kcal, or 330 kJ, has been added, all the ice\nhas changed to water, still at 0℃. Continued addition of heat causes the water's\ntemperature to again increase, now at a rate of 1 C°/kcal. When 100°℃ is reached,\nthe temperature again remains constant as the heat added changes the liquid water\nto vapor (steam). About 540 kcal (2260 kJ) is required to change the 1.0 kg of\nwater completely to steam, after which the graph rises again, indicating that the\ntemperature of the steam rises as heat is added.\nThe heat required to change 1.0 kg of a substance from the solid to the liquid\nstate is called the heat of fusion; it is denoted by LF. The heat of fusion of water\nis 79.7 kcal/kg or, in proper SI units, 333 kJ/kg (= 3.33 × 105 J/kg). The heat\nrequired to change a substance from the liquid to the vapor phase is called the\nheat of vaporization, Ly. For water it is 539 kcal/kg or 2260 KJ/kg. Other\nsubstances follow graphs similar to Fig. 14-5, although the melting-point and\nboiling-point temperatures are different, as are the specific heats and heats of\nfusion and vaporization. Values for the heats of fusion and vaporization, which\nare also called the latent heats, are given in Table 14-3 for a number of substances.\n700 740\nFIGURE 14-5 Temperature as a\nfunction of the heat added to bring\n1.0 kg of ice at -40℃ to steam\nabove 100°C.\nTABLE 14-3 Latent Heats (at 1 atm)\nSubstance\nMelting Point\n(°℃)\nHeat of Fusion\nBoiling Point\n(C)\nHeat of Vaporization\nKJ/kg\nkcal/kg+\nKJ/kg\nkcal/kg+\nOxygen\n-218.8\n14\n3.3\n-183\n210\n51\nNitrogen\n-210.0\n26\n6.1\n-195.8\n200\n48\nEthyl alcohol\n-114\n104\n25\n78\n850\n204\nAmmonia\n-77.8\n33\n8.0\n-33.4\n137\n33\nWater\n0\n333\n79.7\n100\n2260\n539\nLead\n327\n25\n5.9\n1750\n870\n208\nSilver\n961\n88\n21\n2193\n2300\n558\nIron\n1538\n289\n69.1\n3023\n6340\n1520\nTungsten\n3410\n184\n44\n5900\n4800\n1150\n*Numerical values in kcal/kg are the same in cal/g.\nSECTION 14-5 397\n", 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The heats of vaporization and fusion also refer to the amount of heat released\nby a substance when it changes from a gas to a liquid, or from a liquid to a solid.\nThus, steam releases 2260 KJ/kg when it changes to water, and water releases\n333 KJ/kg when it becomes ice. [In these cases of heat release, Q < 0 when using\nthe ≥Q = 0 approach, Eq. 14-3.]\nThe heat involved in a change of phase depends not only on the latent heat\nbut also on the total mass of the substance. That is,\nQ = mL,\n(14-4)\nwhere L is the latent heat of the particular process and substance, m is the mass\nof the substance, and Q is the heat added or released during the phase change.\nFor example, when 5.00 kg of water freezes at 0℃, (5.00 kg)(3.33 × 105 J/kg) =\n1.67 × 106 J of energy is released.\nEXERCISE B A pot of water is boiling on a gas stove, and then you turn up the heat.\nWhat happens?

How much energy does a freezer have to\nremove from 1.5 kg of water at 20℃ to make ice at -12°℃?\nAPPROACH We need to calculate the total energy removed by adding the heat\noutflow (1) to reduce the water temperature from 20℃ to 0°℃, (2) to change\nthe liquid water to solid ice at 0℃, and (3) to lower the ice temperature from\n0°℃ to -12°C.\nSOLUTION The heat Q that needs to be removed from the 1.5 kg of water is\nQ = mcw(20℃ - 0℃) + mLF + mcice[0° - (-12℃)]\n= (1.5 kg) (4186 J/kg · C°)(20 C°) + (1.5 kg)(3.33 × 105 J/kg)\n+ (1.5 kg) (2100 J/kg · C°) (12 C°)\n= 6.6 × 105 J = 660 kJ.\n| EXERCISE C Which process in Example 14-6 required the greatest heat loss?\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nFirst determine (or\nestimate) the final state\nEXAMPLE 14-7\nESTIMATE\nWill all the ice melt?

Ignore any heat flow to the surroundings, including the container.\nAPPROACH Before we can write down an equation applying conservation of\nenergy, we must first check to see if the final state will be all ice, a mixture of ice\nand water at 0℃, or all water. To bring the 3.0 kg of water at 20℃ down to 0℃\nwould require an energy release of\nmw Cw(20℃-0℃) = (3.0kg)(4186 J/kg ·C°)(20 Cº) = 250,000 J.\nOn the other hand, to raise the ice from -10℃ to 0℃ would require\nmice Cice [0°C - (-10℃)]= (0.50kg)(2100 J/kg ·C°)(10C°)\n= 10,500 J,\nand to change the ice to water at 0℃ would require\nmice LF = (0.50 kg)(333 KJ/kg) = 167,000 J.\nThe sum of the last two quantities is 10.5 kJ + 167 kJ = 177 kJ. This is not\nenough energy to bring the 3.0 kg of water at 20℃ down to 0°℃, so we see that\nthe mixture must end up all water, somewhere between 0℃ and 20℃.\n398 CHAPTER 14 Heat\n', 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'SOLUTION To determine the final temperature T, we apply conservation of\nenergy.

If phase changes do or might occur, there may be\nterms in the energy conservation equation of the form\n1. Be sure you have sufficient information to apply energy\nconservation. Ask yourself: is the system isolated (or\nnearly so, enough to get a good estimate)? Do we know\nor can we calculate all significant sources of energy\ntransfer?\nQ = mL, where L is the latent heat. But before\napplying energy conservation, determine (or estimate)\nin which phase the final state will be, as we did in\nExample 14-7 by calculating the different contrib-\nuting values for heat Q.\n2. Apply conservation of energy. Either write\nheat gained = heat lost,\nor use\nΣΩ = 0.\n3. If no phase changes occur, each term in the energy\nconservation equation will have the form\nQ = mc AT.\n5. Note that when the system reaches thermal equilibrium,\nthe final temperature of each substance will have the\nsame value. There is only one Tf .\n6. Solve your energy equation for the unknown.\nEvaporation\nThe latent heat to change a liquid to a gas is needed not only at the boiling point.\nWater can change from the liquid to the gas phase even at room temperature.\nThis process is called evaporation (see previous Chapter, Section 13-12). The value of\nthe heat of vaporization of water increases slightly with a decrease in temperature:\nat 20°℃, for example, it is 2450 KJ/kg (585 kcal/kg) compared to 2260 kJ/kg\n(= 539 kcal/kg) at 100°C. When water evaporates, the remaining liquid cools,\nbecause the energy required (the latent heat of vaporization) comes from the\nwater itself; so its internal energy, and therefore its temperature, must drop .*\n+For any algebraic equation A = B, if you subtract B from both sides you get A - B = B - B = 0, or\nA - B = 0. Thus, if you move a term from one side of an equals sign to the other, the sign (+ or -) changes.\n*Also from the point of view of kinetic theory, evaporation is a cooling process because it is the fastest-\nmoving molecules that escape from the surface (Section 13-12). Hence the average speed of the\nremaining molecules is less, so by Eq. 13-8 the temperature is less.\nSECTION 14-5 Latent Heat 399\n', 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 11, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'PHYSICS APPLIED\nBody temperature\nHotter\nA\nCooler\nHeat\nflow\n---\nT1\n1\nT2\n-\nl\nFIGURE 14-6 Heat conduction\nbetween regions at temperatures T1\nand T2. If T1 is greater than T2, the\nheat flows to the right; the rate is\ngiven by Eq. 14-5.\nEvaporation of water from skin is one of the most important ways the body\nuses to control its temperature. When the temperature of the blood rises slightly\nabove normal, the hypothalamus region of the brain detects this temperature increase\nand sends a signal to the sweat glands to increase their production. The energy (latent\nheat) needed to vaporize this water comes from the body, so the body cools.\nKinetic Theory of Latent Heats\nWe can make use of kinetic theory to see why energy is needed to melt or vaporize\na substance. At the melting point, the latent heat of fusion does not act to increase\nthe average kinetic energy (and the temperature) of the molecules in the solid, but\ninstead is used to overcome the potential energy associated with the forces between\nthe molecules. That is, work must be done against these attractive forces to break\nthe molecules loose from their relatively fixed positions in the solid so they can\nfreely roll over one another in the liquid phase. Similarly, energy is required for\nmolecules held close together in the liquid phase to escape into the gaseous phase\nwhere they are far apart. This process is a more energetic reorganization of the\nmolecules than is melting (the average distance between the molecules is greatly\nincreased), and hence the heat of vaporization is generally much greater than the\nheat of fusion for a given substance.\n14-6 Heat Transfer: Conduction\nHeat is transferred from one place or object to another in three different ways:\nby conduction, by convection, and by radiation. We now discuss each of these in\nturn; but in practical situations, any two or all three may be operating at the same\ntime. This Section deals with conduction.\nWhen a metal poker is put in a hot fire, or a silver spoon is placed in a hot\nbowl of soup, the exposed end of the poker or spoon soon becomes hot as well,\neven though it is not directly in contact with the source of heat. We say that heat\nhas been conducted from the hot end to the cold end.\nHeat conduction in many materials can be visualized as being carried out via\nmolecular collisions. As one end of an object is heated, the molecules there move\nfaster and faster (= higher temperature). As these faster molecules collide with\nslower-moving neighbors, they transfer some of their kinetic energy to them,\nwhich in turn transfer some energy by collision with molecules still farther along\nthe object. Thus the kinetic energy of thermal motion is transferred by molecular\ncollision along the object. In metals, collisions of free electrons are mainly responsi-\nble for conduction. Conduction between objects in physical contact occurs similarly.\nHeat conduction from one point to another takes place only if there is a dif-\nference in temperature between the two points. Indeed, it is found experimentally\nthat the rate of heat flow through a substance is proportional to the difference in\ntemperature between its ends. The rate of heat flow also depends on the size and\nshape of the object. To investigate this quantitatively, let us consider the heat flow\nthrough a uniform cylinder, as illustrated in Fig. 14-6. It is found experimentally\nthat the heat flow Q over a time interval t is given by the relation\n9 = KA 1 - 12\n(14-5)\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the object, l is the distance between the two\nends, which are at temperatures T1 and T2, and k is a proportionality constant\ncalled the thermal conductivity which is characteristic of the material. From\nEq. 14-5, we see that the rate of heat flow (units of J/s) is directly proportional\nto the cross-sectional area and to the temperature gradient (T1 - T2)/l.\n*Equation 14-5 is quite similar to the relations describing diffusion (Section 13-13) and the flow of\nfluids through a pipe (Section 10-12). In those cases, the flow of matter was found to be proportional\nto the concentration gradient (C1 - C2)/2, or to the pressure gradient (P1 - P2)/2. This close simi-\nlarity is one reason we speak of the "flow" of heat. Yet we must keep in mind that no substance is\nflowing in the case of heat-it is energy that is being transferred.\n400 CHAPTER 14 Heat\n', 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The thermal conductivities, k, for a variety of substances are given in Table 14-4.\nSubstances for which k is large conduct heat rapidly and are said to be good thermal\nconductors. Most metals fall in this category, although there is a wide range even\namong them, as you may observe by holding the ends of a silver spoon and a\nstainless-steel spoon immersed in the same hot cup of soup. Substances for which\nk is small, such as wool, fiberglass, polyurethane, and goose down, are poor\nconductors of heat and are therefore good thermal insulators. The relative magni-\ntudes of k can explain simple phenomena such as why a tile floor is much colder\non the feet than a rug-covered floor at the same temperature. Tile is a better\nconductor of heat than the rug. Heat that flows from your foot to the rug is not\nconducted away rapidly, so the rug\'s surface quickly warms up to the temperature\nof your foot and feels good. But the tile conducts the heat away rapidly and thus\ncan take more heat from your foot quickly, so your foot\'s surface temperature drops.\nEXAMPLE 14-8\nHeat loss through windows. A major source of heat loss\nfrom a house in cold weather is through the windows. Calculate the rate of heat flow\nthrough a glass window 2.0 m X 1.5 m in area and 3.2 mm thick, if the temperatures\nat the inner and outer surfaces are 15.0°C and 14.0℃, respectively (Fig. 14-7).\nAPPROACH Heat flows by conduction through the 3.2-mm thickness of glass\nfrom the higher inside temperature to the lower outside temperature. We use\nthe heat conduction equation, Eq. 14-5.\nSOLUTION Here A = (2.0m)(1.5m) = 3.0m2 and ( = 3.2 × 10-3 m. Using\nTable 14-4 to get k, we have\nt\nQ\n= KAT1 - T2\n1\n(0.84 J/s · m · C°)(3.0m2)(15.0℃ - 14.0℃)\n=\n(3.2 × 10-3m)\n= 790 J/s.\nNOTE This rate of heat flow is equivalent to (790 J/s)/(4.19 × 103 J/kcal) =\n0.19 kcal/s, or (0.19 kcal/s) X (3600 s/h) = 680 kcal/h.\nYou might notice in Example 14-8 that 15°C is not very warm for the living\nroom of a house. The room itself may indeed be much warmer, and the outside\nmight be colder than 14℃. But the temperatures of 15℃ and 14℃ were spec-\nified as those at the window surfaces, and there is usually a considerable drop\nin temperature of the air in the vicinity of the window both on the inside and the\noutside. That is, the layer of air on either side of the window acts as an insulator, and\nnormally the major part of the temperature drop between the inside and outside of\nthe house takes place across the air layer. If there is a heavy wind, the air outside\na window will constantly be replaced with cold air; the temperature gradient\nacross the glass will be greater and there will be a much greater rate of heat loss.\nIncreasing the width of the air layer, such as using two panes of glass separated\nby an air gap, will reduce the heat loss more than simply increasing the glass\nthickness, since the thermal conductivity of air is much less than that for glass.\nSuch "double-pane windows" are often called thermal windows.\nThe insulating properties of clothing come from the insulating properties of\nair. Without clothes, our bodies in still air would heat the air in contact with the\nskin and would soon become reasonably comfortable because air is a very good\ninsulator. But since air moves-there are breezes and drafts, and people move\nabout-the warm air would be replaced by cold air, thus increasing the tempera-\nture difference and the heat loss from the body. Clothes keep us warm by trapping\nair so it cannot move readily. It is not the cloth that insulates us, but the air that the\ncloth traps. Goose down is a very good insulator because even a small amount of\nit fluffs up and traps a great amount of air.\nTABLE 14-4\nThermal Conductivities\nSubstance\nThermal Conductivity, k\nJ\nkcal\n(s . m .

Larger R means better insulation from heat or cold.\nIn the United States, R-values are given in British units as ft2 . h . F/Btu (for\nexample, R-19 means R = 19 ft2 . h . F/Btu). Table 14-5 gives R-values for some\ncommon building materials. R-values increase directly with material thickness:\nfor example, 2 inches of fiberglass is R-6, whereas 4 inches is R-12.\n14-7 Heat Transfer: Convection\nAlthough liquids and gases are generally not very good conductors of heat, they can\ntransfer heat rapidly by convection. Convection is the process whereby heat flows\nby the bulk movement of molecules from one place to another. Whereas conduction\ninvolves molecules (and/or electrons) moving only over small distances and colliding,\nconvection involves the movement of large numbers of molecules over large distances.\nA forced-air furnace, in which air is heated and then blown by a fan into a\nroom, is an example of forced convection. Natural convection occurs as well, and\none familiar example is that hot air rises. For instance, the air above a radiator\n(or other type of heater) expands as it is heated (Chapter 13), and hence its density\ndecreases. Because its density is less than that of the surrounding cooler air, it rises\nvia buoyancy, just as a log submerged in water floats upward because its density\nis less than that of water. Warm or cold ocean currents, such as the balmy Gulf\nStream, represent natural convection on a global scale. Wind is another example of\nconvection, and weather in general is strongly influenced by convective air currents.\nWhen a pot of water is heated (Fig. 14-8), convection currents are set up as\nthe heated water at the bottom of the pot rises because of its reduced density.\nThat heated water is replaced by cooler water from above. This principle is used\nin many heating systems, such as the hot-water radiator system shown in Fig. 14-9.\nWater is heated in the furnace, and as its temperature increases, it expands and\nrises as shown. This causes the water to circulate in the heating system. Hot\nwater then enters the radiators, heat is transferred by conduction to the air, and\nthe cooled water returns to the furnace. Thus, the water circulates because of\nconvection; pumps are sometimes used to improve circulation. The air throughout\nthe room also becomes heated as a result of convection. The air heated by the\nradiators rises and is replaced by cooler air, resulting in convective air currents,\nas shown by the green arrows in Fig. 14-9.\nOther types of furnaces also depend on convection. Hot-air furnaces with\nregisters (openings) near the floor often do not have fans but depend on natural\nconvection, which can be appreciable. In other systems, a fan is used. In either\ncase, it is important that cold air can return to the furnace so that convective cur-\nrents circulate throughout the room if the room is to be uniformly heated.\nThe human body produces a great deal of thermal energy. Of the food energy\ntransformed within the body, at best 20% is used to do work, so over 80% appears\nas thermal energy. During light activity, for example, if this thermal energy were not\ndissipated, the body temperature would rise about 3 C° per hour. Clearly, the heat\ngenerated by the body must be transferred to the outside. Is the heat transferred\nby conduction? The temperature of the skin in a comfortable environment is\n33 to 35°C, whereas the interior of the body is at 37℃. Calculation shows\n(Problem 46) that, because of this small temperature difference, plus the low thermal\nconductivity of tissue, direct conduction is responsible for very little of the heat\nthat must leave the body. Instead, the heat is carried to the skin by the blood.\nIn addition to all its other important responsibilities, blood acts as a convective\nfluid to transfer heat to just beneath the surface of the skin. It is then conducted\n(over a very short distance) to the surface. Once at the surface, the heat is trans-\nferred to the environment by convection, evaporation, and radiation (Section 14-8).\n402 CHAPTER 14 Heat\n', 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 14, 'type': 'text', 'content': "14-8 Heat Transfer: Radiation\nConvection and conduction require the presence of matter as a medium to carry\nthe heat from the hotter to the colder region. But a third type of heat transfer\noccurs without any medium at all. All life on Earth depends on the transfer of\nenergy from the Sun, and this energy is transferred to the Earth over empty (or\nnearly empty) space. This form of energy transfer is heat-since the Sun's surface\ntemperature (6000 K) is much higher than Earth's (~ 300 K)-and is referred to\nas radiation (Fig. 14-10). The warmth we receive from a fire is mainly radiant\nenergy.\nAs we shall see in later Chapters, radiation consists essentially of electromag-\nnetic waves. Suffice it to say for now that radiation from the Sun consists of visible\nlight plus many other wavelengths that the eye is not sensitive to, including\ninfrared (IR) radiation, which is mainly responsible for heating the Earth.\nThe rate at which an object radiates energy has been found to be proportional\nto the fourth power of the Kelvin temperature, T. That is, an object at 2000 K,\nas compared to one at 1000 K, radiates energy at a rate 24 = 16 times as much.\nThe rate of radiation is also proportional to the area A of the emitting object,\nso the rate at which energy leaves the object, Q/t, is\n2 = 60 AT4.\n(14-6)\nThis is called the Stefan-Boltzmann equation, and o is a universal constant called\nthe Stefan-Boltzmann constant which has the value\n0 = 5.67 × 10-8 W/m2 . K4.\nThe factor E, called the emissivity, is a number between 0 and 1 that is character-\nistic of the surface of the radiating material. Very black surfaces, such as charcoal,\nhave emissivity close to 1, whereas shiny metal surfaces have e close to zero and\nthus emit correspondingly less radiation. The value of e depends somewhat on\nthe temperature of the material.\nNot only do shiny surfaces emit less radiation, but they absorb little of the\nradiation that falls upon them (most is reflected). Black and very dark objects\nare good emitters (€ ~ 1); they also absorb nearly all the radiation that falls on\nthem-which is why light-colored clothing is usually preferable to dark clothing\non a hot day. Thus, a good absorber is also a good emitter.\nAny object not only emits energy by radiation but also absorbs energy radiated\nby other objects. If an object of emissivity e and area A is at a temperature T1, it\nradiates energy at a rate Eo AT4. If the object is surrounded by an environment\nat temperature T2, the rate at which the surroundings radiate energy is propor-\ntional to T4; then the rate that energy is absorbed by the object is proportional\nto T4. The net rate of radiant heat flow from the object is given by the equation\n2 = EGA(T4 - T2),\n(14-7)\nwhere A is the surface area of the object, T1 its temperature and e its emissivity\n(at temperature T1), and T2 is the temperature of the surroundings. This equation\nis consistent with the experimental fact that equilibrium between the object and\nits surroundings is reached when they come to the same temperature. That is,\nQ/t must equal zero when T1 = T2, so E must be the same for emission and\nabsorption. This confirms the idea that a good emitter is a good absorber. Because\nboth the object and its surroundings radiate energy, there is a net transfer of energy\nfrom one to the other unless everything is at the same temperature. From Eq. 14-7\nit is clear that if T1 > T2, the net flow of heat is from the object to the surroundings,\nso the object cools. But if T1 < T2, the net heat flow is from the surroundings into\nthe object, and the object's temperature rises. If different parts of the surroundings\nare at different temperatures, Eq. 14-7 becomes more complicated.\nFIGURE 14-10 The Sun's surface\nradiates at 6000 K-much higher\nthan the Earth's surface.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nDark vs. light clothing\nte is the Greek letter epsilon.\nSECTION 14-8 Heat Transfer: Radiation 403\n", 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'PHYSICS APPLIED\nThe body\'s radiative heat loss\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nMust use the Kelvin temperature\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nTA - T2 + (T1 -T2)4\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nRoom comfort\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nPrefer warm walls, cool air\nEXAMPLE 14-9\nESTIMATE\nCooling by radiation. An athlete is sitting\nunclothed in a locker room whose dark walls are at a temperature of 15℃. Estimate\nthe body\'s rate of heat loss by radiation, assuming a skin temperature of 34℃ and\nE = 0.70.

Hence, our person\'s temperature would drop, causing considerable\ndiscomfort. The body responds to excessive heat loss by increasing its metabolic rate,\nand shivering is one method by which the body increases its metabolism. Naturally,\nclothes help a lot. Example 14-9 illustrates that a person may be uncomfortable\neven if the temperature of the air is, say, 25℃, which is quite a warm room. If\nthe walls or floor are cold, radiation to them occurs no matter how warm the air\nis. Indeed, it is estimated that radiation accounts for about 50% of the heat loss\nfrom a sedentary person in a normal room. Rooms are most comfortable when the\nwalls and floor are warm and the air is not so warm. Floors and walls can be heated\nby means of hot-water conduits or electric heating elements. Such first-rate heat-\ning systems are becoming more common today, and it is interesting to note that\n2000 years ago the Romans, even in houses in the remote province of Great Britain,\nmade use of hot-water and steam conduits in the floor to heat their houses.\nEXAMPLE 14-10\nESTIMATE\nTwo teapots. A ceramic teapot (€ = 0.70)\nand a shiny one (€ = 0.10) each hold 0.75 L of tea at 95℃. (a) Estimate the rate\nof heat loss from each, and (b) estimate the temperature drop after 30 min for\neach. Consider only radiation, and assume the surroundings are at 20℃.\nAPPROACH We are given all the information necessary to calculate the heat\nloss due to radiation, except for the area. The teapot holds 0.75 L, and we can\napproximate it as a cube 10 cm on a side (volume = 1.0L), with five sides\nexposed. To estimate the temperature drop in (b), we use the concept of spe-\ncific heat and ignore the contribution of the pots compared to that of the water.\nSOLUTION (a) The teapot, approximated by a cube 10 cm on a side with five\nsides exposed, has a surface area of about 5 × (0.1 m)2 = 5 × 10-2m2. The\nrate of heat loss would be about\nQ\nt\n= CƠ A(T4 - T4)\n= € (5.67 × 10-8 W/m2.K4)(5× 10-2m2)[(368K)4-(293K)4] ~€(30) W,\nor about 20 W for the ceramic pot (€ = 0.70) and 3 W for the shiny one (€ = 0.10).\n(b) To estimate the temperature drop, we use the specific heat of water and\nignore the contribution of the pots. The mass of 0.75 L of water is 0.75 kg. (Recall\nthat 1.0L = 1000 cm3 = 1×10-3m3 and p=1000kg/m3.) Using Eq. 14-2\nand Table 14-1, we get\nOil\nAT\n= mc AT.\nt\nThen\nt\n€ (30) J/s\nt\nAT - Q/t =\n~ € (0.01) Co/s.\n(0.75 kg)(4186 J/kg · C°)\nAfter 30 min (1800 s), AT = €(0.01 C°/s)t= €(0.01 C°/s)(1800s) ~ 18€ C°,\nor about 12 C° for the ceramic pot (€ = 0.70) and about 2 C° for the shiny one\n(€ = 0.10). The shiny one clearly has an advantage, at least in terms of radiation.\nNOTE Convection and conduction could play a greater role than radiation.\n404 CHAPTER 14 Heat\n', 'chapter_title': '14-1 Heat as Energy Transfer'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Heating of an object by radiation from the Sun cannot be calculated using\nEq. 14-7 since this equation assumes a uniform temperature, T2, of the environ-\nment surrounding the object, whereas the Sun is essentially a point source. Hence\nthe Sun must be treated as a separate source of energy. About 1350 J of energy\nfrom the Sun strikes Earth\'s atmosphere per second per square meter of area at\nright angles to the Sun\'s rays. This number, 1350 W/m2, is called the solar constant.\nThe atmosphere may absorb as much as 70% of this energy before it reaches the\nground, depending on the cloud cover. On a clear day, about 1000 W/m2 reaches\nthe Earth\'s surface. An object of emissivity e with area A facing the Sun absorbs\nenergy from the Sun at a rate, in watts, of about\n₾ = (1000 W/m2) € A cos 0,\n(14-8)\nwhere 0 is the angle between the Sun\'s rays and a line perpendicular to the area A\n(Fig. 14-11). That is, A cos 0 is the "effective" area, at right angles to the Sun\'s\nrays.\nThe explanation for the seasons and the polar ice caps (see Fig. 14-12)\ndepends on this cos 0 factor in Eq. 14-8. The seasons are not a result of how close\nthe Earth is to the Sun-in fact, in the Northern Hemisphere, summer occurs\nwhen the Earth is farthest from the Sun. It is the angle (i.e., cos 0) that really mat-\nters. Furthermore, the reason the Sun heats the Earth more at midday than at\nsunrise or sunset is also related to this cos 0 factor.\nEXAMPLE 14-11\nESTIMATE\nGetting a tan-energy absorption.

See Fig. 14-11.\nSOLUTION Since cos 30° = 0.866, we have\n₾ = (1000 W/m2) € A cos 0\nNOTE If a person wears light-colored clothing, e is much smaller, so the energy\nabsorbed is less.\nAn interesting application of thermal radiation to diagnostic medicine is\nthermography. A special instrument, the thermograph, scans the body, measuring\nthe intensity of infrared radiation from many points and forming a picture that\nresembles an X-ray (Fig. 14-13).

For an ideal monatomic gas,\nU = 2NKT = 2nRT\n(14-1)\nwhere N is the number of molecules or n is the number of moles.\nHeat refers to the transfer of energy from one object to\nanother because of a difference of temperature. Heat is thus\nmeasured in energy units, such as joules.\nHeat and internal energy are also sometimes specified in\ncalories or kilocalories (kcal), where\n1 kcal = 4.186 kJ\nis the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg\nof water by 1 Co.\nThe specific heat, c, of a substance is defined as the energy\n(or heat) required to change the temperature of unit mass of\nthe substance by 1 degree; as an equation,\nQ = mc AT,\n(14-2)\nwhere Q is the heat absorbed or given off, AT is the temperature\nincrease or decrease, and m is the mass of the substance.\nWhen heat flows between parts of an isolated system, con-\nservation of energy tells us that the heat gained by one part of\nthe system is equal to the heat lost by the other part of the\nsystem. This is the basis of calorimetry, which is the quantitative\nmeasurement of heat exchange.\nQuestions\n1. What happens to the work done on a jar of orange juice\nwhen it is vigorously shaken?\n2. When a hot object warms a cooler object, does tempera-\nture flow between them? Are the temperature changes of\nthe two objects equal? Explain.\n3. (a) If two objects of different temperatures are placed in\ncontact, will heat naturally flow from the object with higher\ninternal energy to the object with lower internal energy?\n(b) Is it possible for heat to flow even if the internal energies\nof the two objects are the same? Explain.\nExchange of energy occurs, without a change in temperature,\nwhenever a substance changes phase. The heat of fusion is the\nheat required to melt 1 kg of a solid into the liquid phase; it is\nalso equal to the heat given off when the substance changes from\nliquid to solid. The heat of vaporization is the energy required\nto change 1 kg of a substance from the liquid to the vapor phase;\nit is also the energy given off when the substance changes from\nvapor to liquid.\nHeat is transferred from one place (or object) to another\nin three different ways: conduction, convection, and radiation.\nIn conduction, energy is transferred through a substance by\nmeans of collisions between hotter (faster) molecules or electrons\nwith their slower moving neighbors.\nConvection is the transfer of energy by the mass movement\nof molecules even over considerable distances.\nRadiation, which does not require the presence of matter,\nis energy transfer by electromagnetic waves, such as from the\nSun. All objects radiate energy in an amount that is propor-\ntional to the fourth power of their Kelvin temperature (T4) and\nto their surface area. The energy radiated (or absorbed) also\ndepends on the nature of the surface (dark surfaces absorb and\nradiate more than do bright shiny ones), which is characterized\nby the emissivity, E.\nRadiation from the Sun arrives at the surface of the Earth\non a clear day at a rate of about 1000 W/m2.\n4.
