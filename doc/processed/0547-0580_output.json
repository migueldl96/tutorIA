Scientific measurements-whether in\nphysics, biology, or medicine-make use of electric circuits. In Chapter 18,\nwe discussed the basic principles of electric current. Now we apply these princi-\nples to analyze de circuits involving combinations of batteries, resistors, and\ncapacitors. We also study the operation of some useful instruments."\nWhen we draw a diagram for a circuit, we represent batteries, capacitors, and\nresistors by the symbols shown in Table 19-1. Wires whose resistance is negligible\ncompared with other resistance in the circuit are drawn as straight lines. A ground\nsymbol ( or ) may mean a real connection to the ground, perhaps via a\nmetal pipe, or it may mean a common connection, such as the frame of a car.\nFor the most part in this Chapter, except in Section 19-6 on RC circuits, we\nwill be interested in circuits operating in their steady state. We won\'t be looking at a\ncircuit at the moment a change is made in it, such as when a battery or resistor is con-\nnected or disconnected, but only when the currents have reached their steady values.\n+AC circuits that contain only a voltage source and resistors can be analyzed like the de circuits in this\nChapter. However, ac circuits that contain capacitors and other circuit elements are more compli-\ncated, and we discuss them in Chapter 21.\n', 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 2, 'type': 'text', 'content': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage\nTo have current in an electric circuit, we need a device such as a battery or an electric\ngenerator that transforms one type of energy (chemical, mechanical, or light, for\nexample) into electric energy. Such a device is called a source of electromotive force+\nor of emf. The potential difference between the terminals of such a source, when\nno current flows to an external circuit, is called the emf of the source. The symbol\nis usually used for emf (don\'t confuse & with E for electric field), and its unit is volts.\nA battery is not a source of constant current-the current out of a battery\nvaries according to the resistance in the circuit. A battery is, however, a nearly\nconstant voltage source, but not perfectly constant as we now discuss. For example,\nif you start a car with the headlights on, you may notice the headlights dim. This\nhappens because the starter draws a large current, and the battery voltage drops below\nits rated emf as a result. The voltage drop occurs because the chemical reactions in\na battery cannot supply charge fast enough to maintain the full emf. For one thing,\ncharge must move (within the electrolyte) between the electrodes of the battery,\nand there is always some hindrance to completely free flow. Thus, a battery itself\nhas some resistance, which is called its internal resistance; it is usually designated r.\nA real battery is modeled as if it were a perfect emf & in series with a resistor r,\nas shown in Fig. 19-1. Since this resistance r is inside the battery, we can never sepa-\nrate it from the battery. The two points a and b in Fig. 19-1 represent the two\nterminals of the battery. What we measure is the terminal voltage Vab = Va - Vb .\nWhen no current is drawn from the battery, the terminal voltage equals the emf,\nwhich is determined by the chemical reactions in the battery: Vab = 8. However,\nwhen a current I flows from the battery there is an internal drop in voltage\nequal to Ir. Thus the terminal voltage (the actual voltage applied to a circuit) is\nVab = % - Ir.\n[current I flows from battery] (19-1)\nFor example, if a 12-V battery has an internal resistance of 0.1 , then when 10 A\nflows from the battery, the terminal voltage is 12 V - (10 A)(0.1 (2) = 11 V. The\ninternal resistance of a battery is usually small. For example, an ordinary flashlight\nbattery when fresh may have an internal resistance of perhaps 0.05 Q. (However, as\nit ages and the electrolyte dries out, the internal resistance increases to many ohms.)\nCAUTION\nWhy battery voltage isn\'t perfectly\nconstant\nVab =\nterminal voltage\n+\n90\n–\nr\na\nb\nFIGURE 19-1 Diagram for an\nelectric cell or battery.\nEXAMPLE 19-1\nBattery with internal resistance.

Do not confuse V (italic) for voltage, with V (not italic) for\nthe volt unit.\n19-2 Resistors in Series and in Parallel\nWhen two or more resistors are connected end to end along a single path as\nshown in Fig. 19-3a, they are said to be connected in series. The resistors could\nbe simple resistors as were pictured in Fig. 18-11, or they could be lightbulbs\n(Fig. 19-3b), or heating elements, or other resistive devices. Any charge that\npasses through R1 in Fig. 19-3a will also pass through R2 and then R3. Hence the\nsame current I passes through each resistor. (If it did not, this would imply that\neither charge was not conserved, or that charge was accumulating at some point\nin the circuit, which does not happen in the steady state.)\nWe let V represent the potential difference (voltage) across all three resistors\nin Fig. 19-3a. We assume all other resistance in the circuit can be ignored, so V\nequals the terminal voltage supplied by the battery. We let V1, V2, and V3 be the\npotential differences across each of the resistors, R1, R2, and R3, respectively.\nFrom Ohm\'s law, V = IR, we can write V1 = IR1, V2 = IR2, and V3 = IR3.\nBecause the resistors are connected end to end, energy conservation tells us that\nthe total voltage V is equal to the sum of the voltages across each resistor:\n+\n–\nV\nFIGURE 19-3 (a) Resistances\nconnected in series. (b) Resistances\ncould be lightbulbs, or any other\ntype of resistance.

(c) The equivalent\ncircuit with Req obtained from Eq. 19-4:\nV = V1 + V2 + V3 = IR1 + IR2 + IR3.\n[series] (19-2)\nNow let us determine the equivalent single resistance Reg that would draw\nthe same current I as our combination of three resistors in series; see Fig. 19-3c.\nSuch a single resistance Req would be related to V by\nV = IReq.\nWe equate this expression with Eq. 19-2, V = I(R1 + R2 + R3), and find\n1\nReq = R1 + R2 + R3.\n[series] (19-3)\n=\nReq\nA\nR1\nR2\n- + R2 + R3\n1\nI1\nR1\nI2\nR2\n(c)\nWhen we put several resistances in series, the total or equivalent resistance\nis the sum of the separate resistances. (Sometimes we call it "net resistance.")\nThis sum applies to any number of resistances in series. Note that when you add\nmore resistance to the circuit, the current through the circuit will decrease. For\nexample, if a 12-V battery is connected to a 4-2 resistor, the current will be 3 A.\nBut if the 12-V battery is connected to three 4-2 resistors in series, the total\nresistance is 12 Q and the current through the entire circuit will be only 1 A.\nB\nI\n(a)\n(b)\nI3.\nR3\n+\n–\nV\n+\n–\nReg\n+\n–\nI\nAnother way to connect resistors is in parallel, so that the current from the source\nsplits into separate branches or paths (Fig. 19-4a). Wiring in houses and buildings is\narranged so all electric devices are in parallel, as we saw in Chapter 18, Fig. 18-20.\nWith parallel wiring, if you disconnect one device (say, R1 in Fig. 19-4a), the cur-\nrent to the other devices is not interrupted. Compare to a series circuit, where if\none device (say, R1 in Fig. 19-3a) is disconnected, the current is stopped to all others.\nIn a parallel circuit, Fig. 19-4a, the total current I that leaves the battery\nsplits into three separate paths. We let I1 , I2 , and I3 be the currents through each\nof the resistors, R1 , R2, and R3, respectively. Because electric charge is conserved,\nthe current I flowing into junction A (where the different wires or conductors\nmeet, Fig. 19-4a) must equal the current flowing out of the junction. Thus\nI = I1 + I2 + I3 .\n[parallel]\nWhen resistors are connected in parallel, each has the same voltage across it.\n(Indeed, any two points in a circuit connected by a wire of negligible resistance\nare at the same potential.) Hence the full voltage of the battery is applied to each\nresistor in Fig. 19-4a. Applying Ohm\'s law to each resistor, we have\n4 = 12 = , and 3 =\nV\nLet us now determine what single resistor Reg (Fig. 19-4c) will draw the same\n528 CHAPTER 19 DC Circuits\n', 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'current I as these three resistances in parallel.

The equivalent resistance of the two 4-22\n"resistors" in parallel is\n1\n=\n1\n40 + 40\n1 = 2\n40 -20\n1\nReq\nand so Req = 20. Thus the net (or equivalent) resistance is less than each single\nresistance. This may at first seem surprising. But remember that when you connect\nresistors in parallel, you are giving the current additional paths to follow. Hence\nthe net resistance will be less.+\nEquations 19-3 and 19-4 make good sense. Recalling Eq. 18-3 for resistivity,\nR = pl/A, we see that placing resistors in series effectively increases the length\nand therefore the resistance; putting resistors in parallel effectively increases the\narea through which current flows, thus reducing the overall resistance.\nNote that whenever a group of resistors is replaced by the equivalent resistance,\ncurrent and voltage and power in the rest of the circuit are unaffected.\nEXERCISE A You have a 10-0 and a 15-2 resistor. What is the smallest and largest\nequivalent resistance that you can make with these two resistors?\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 19-2\nSeries or parallel? (a) The lightbulbs in\nFig. 19-5 are identical. Which configuration produces more light? (b) Which way\ndo you think the headlights of a car are wired?

Thus Req = R/2. The parallel com-\nbination then has lower resistance (= R/2) than the series combination\n(Req = R + R = 2R). There will be more total current in the parallel configu-\nration (2), since I = V /Req and V is the same for both circuits. The total power\ntransformed, which is related to the light produced, is P = IV, so the greater\ncurrent in (2) means more light is produced.\n(b) Headlights are wired in parallel (2), because if one bulb goes out, the other bulb\ncan stay lit. If they were in series (1), when one bulb burned out (the filament broke),\nthe circuit would be open and no current would flow, so neither bulb would light.\n+\n12 V\n–\n(1) Series\n+\n12 V\n(2) Parallel\nEXERCISE B Return to the Chapter-Opening Question, page 526, and answer it\nagain now.

Consider two identical pipes taking in water near the top of a dam and releas-\ning it at the bottom as shown in the figure to the right. If both pipes are open, rather than only one,\ntwice as much water will flow through. That is, the net resistance to the flow of water will be reduced\nby half with two equal pipes open, just as for electrical resistors in parallel.\nSECTION 19-2 Resistors in Series and in Parallel 529\n', 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': "V = 24.0 V\nY\nI\nI\nR1\nN\nN\nI2\nR2\n(a)\nV = 24.0 V\n*\nI\nR1\nR2\n(b)\nFIGURE 19-6 Example 19-3.\nEXAMPLE 19-3\nSeries and parallel resistors.

What is the\ncurrent through each resistor and what is the equivalent resistance of each circuit?\nAPPROACH We use Ohm's law and the ideas just discussed for series and parallel\nconnections to get the current in each case. We can also use Eqs. 19-3 and 19-4.\nSOLUTION (a) Any given charge (or electron) can flow through only one or\nthe other of the two resistors in Fig. 19-6a. Just as a river may break into two\nstreams when going around an island, here too the total current I from the\nbattery (Fig. 19-6a) splits to flow through each resistor, so I equals the sum of\nthe separate currents through the two resistors:\nI = I1 + I2 .\nThe potential difference across each resistor is the battery voltage V = 24.0 V.\nApplying Ohm's law to each resistor gives\n24.0 V\n4 + b = K + K = 2\n24.0 V\n+\n100\n24.0 V\n= 50Ω.\n100 2\n= 0.24 A + 0.24 A = 0.48 A.\nThe equivalent resistance is\nReq = Y = 0.48 A\nWe could also have obtained this result from Eq. 19-4:\n1\n=\n1\n=\n2\n+\nReq\n100 2\n100 0\n1\n=\n1\n100 2\n502\n,\nso Reg = 50 Ω.\n(b) All the current that flows out of the battery passes first through R1 and then\nthrough R2 because they lie along a single path, Fig. 19-6b. So the current I is\nthe same in both resistors; the potential difference V across the battery equals\nthe total change in potential across the two resistors:\nV = V1 + V2.\nOhm's law gives V = IR1 + IR2 = I(R1 + R2).

A simple\ncircuit like Fig. 19-6b is thus often called a simple voltage divider.\nc\nEXAMPLE 19-4\nCircuit with series and parallel resistors. How much\ncurrent is drawn from the battery shown in Fig. 19-7a?\nI\nAPPROACH The current I that flows out of the battery all passes through the\n400-2 resistor, but then it splits into I1 and I2 passing through the 500-2 and\n700-22 resistors. The latter two resistors are in parallel with each other. We look\nfor something that we already know how to treat. So let's start by finding the\nequivalent resistance, Rp, of the parallel resistors, 500 0 and 700 2. Then we\ncan consider this Rp to be in series with the 400- resistor.\nc\nSOLUTION The equivalent resistance, Rp, of the 500-22 and 700-22 resistors in\nparallel is\n1\n=\n1\n+\nRp\n500 2\n1\n= 0.0020 (2-1 + 0.0014 (2-1 = 0.0034 (-1.\n700 2\nThis is 1/Rp, so we take the reciprocal to find Rp.\n530 CHAPTER 19 DC Circuits\n", 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': "CAUTION\nIt is a common mistake to forget to take this reciprocal.

What is the current I1 through the\n500-0 resistor in Fig. 19-7a?\nAPPROACH We need the voltage across the 500-2 resistor, which is the voltage\nbetween points b and c in Fig. 19-7a, and we call it Vbc . Once Voc is known, we can\napply Ohm's law, V = IR, to get the current. First we find the voltage across the\n400-22 resistor, Vab , since we know that 17.4 mA passes through it (Example 19-4).\nSOLUTION Vab can be found using V = IR:\nVab = (0.0174 A) (400 (2) = 7.0 V.\nThe total voltage across the network of resistors is Vac = 12.0 V, so Vbc must be\n12.0 V - 7.0 V = 5.0 V. Ohm's law gives the current I1 through the 500-22 resistor:\nI1 =\n5.0 V\n500 2\n= 1.0× 10-2A = 10mA.\nThis is the answer we wanted. We can also calculate the current I2 through the\n700- resistor since the voltage across it is also 5.0 V:\n5.0 V\n= 7 mA.\nI2 =\n700 2\nNOTE When I1 combines with I2 to form the total current I (at point c in\nFig. 19-7a), their sum is 10 mA + 7 mA = 17 mA. This equals the total current I\nas calculated in Example 19-4, as it should.\nA\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 19-6\nBulb brightness in a circuit. The circuit\nin Fig. 19-8 has three identical lightbulbs, each of resistance R. (a) When switch S\nis closed, how will the brightness of bulbs A and B compare with that of bulb C?\n(b) What happens when switch S is opened? Use a minimum of mathematics.\nRESPONSE (a) With switch S closed, the current that passes through bulb C must\nsplit into two equal parts when it reaches the junction leading to bulbs A and B\nbecause the resistance of bulb A equals that of B. Thus, A and B each receive half\nof C's current; A and B will be equally bright, but less bright than C (P = I2R).\n(b) When the switch S is open, no current can flow through bulb A, so it will be\ndark. Now, the same current passes through bulbs B and C, so B and C will\nbe equally bright. The equivalent resistance of this circuit (= R + R) is greater\nthan that of the circuit with the switch closed, so the current leaving the battery\nis reduced. Thus, bulb C will be dimmer when we open the switch, but bulb B\nwill be brighter because it gets more current when the switch is open (you may\nwant to use some mathematics here).\nC\nS\nN\nW\nB\nFIGURE 19-8 Example 19-6, three\nidentical lightbulbs.

This 4.8 02 is in series with the 5.0-0 resistor\nand the 0.50-02 internal resistance of the battery (Fig. 19-10d), so the total\nequivalent resistance Reg of the circuit is Req = 4.8 (2 + 5.00 + 0.500 = 10.32.\nHence the current drawn is\nReq\n00\n=\n9.0 V\n10.32\n= 0.87 A.\n(b) The terminal voltage of the battery is\nVab = % - Ir = 9.0V - (0.87 A)(0.50 (2) = 8.6 V.\n(c) Now we can work back and get the current in the 6.0-0 resistor. It must be\nthe same as the current through the 8.7 ( shown in Fig. 19-10c (why?). The\nvoltage across that 8.7 22 will be the emf of the battery minus the voltage\ndrops across r and the 5.0-02 resistor: V8.7 = 9.0V - (0.87 A)(0.50 ( + 5.02).\nApplying Ohm's law, we get the current (call it I')\n=\n9.0V-(0.87A)(0.50(+5.00)\n8.7 2\n= 0.48 A.\nThis is the current through the 6.0-2 resistor.\n19-3 Kirchhoff's Rules\nIn the last few Examples we have been able to find the currents in circuits by com-\nbining resistances in series and parallel, and using Ohm's law. This technique can\nbe used for many circuits. However, some circuits are too complicated for that\nanalysis. For example, we cannot find the currents in each part of the circuit shown\nin Fig. 19-11 simply by combining resistances as we did before.\nTo deal with complicated circuits, we use Kirchhoff's rules, devised by G. R.\nKirchhoff (1824-1887) in the mid-nineteenth century. There are two rules, and they\nare simply convenient applications of the laws of conservation of charge and energy.\n", 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Kirchhoff\'s first rule or junction rule is based on the conservation of electric\ncharge (we already used it to derive the equation for parallel resistors). It states that\nat any junction point, the sum of all currents entering the junction must\nequal the sum of all currents leaving the junction.\nThat is, whatever charge goes in must come out. For example, at the junction\npoint a in Fig. 19-11, 13 is entering whereas I1 and I2 are leaving. Thus Kirchhoff\'s\njunction rule states that I3 = I1 + I2. We already saw an instance of this in the\nNOTE at the end of Example 19-5.\nKirchhoff\'s second rule or loop rule is based on the conservation of energy.\nIt states that\nthe sum of the changes in potential around any closed loop of a circuit must\nbe zero.\nJunction rule\n(conservation of charge)\nLoop rule\n(conservation of energy)\nTo see why this rule should hold, consider a rough analogy with the potential energy\nof a roller coaster on its track. When the roller coaster starts from the station, it\nhas a particular potential energy. As it is pulled up the first hill, its gravitational\npotential energy increases and reaches a maximum at the top. As it descends the\nother side, its potential energy decreases and reaches a local minimum at the\nbottom of the hill. As the roller coaster continues on its up and down path, its poten-\ntial energy goes through more changes. But when it arrives back at the starting\npoint, it has exactly as much potential energy as it had when it started at this point.\nAnother way of saying this is that there was as much uphill as there was downhill.\nSimilar reasoning can be applied to an electric circuit. We will analyze the circuit\nof Fig. 19-11 shortly, but first we consider the simpler circuit in Fig. 19-12. We have\nchosen it to be the same as the equivalent circuit of Fig. 19-7b already discussed.\nThe current in this circuit is I = (12.0 V)/(690 (2) = 0.0174 A, as we calculated in\nExample 19-4. (We keep an extra digit in I to reduce rounding errors.) The positive\nside of the battery, point e in Fig. 19-12a, is at a high potential compared to\npoint d at the negative side of the battery. That is, point e is like the top of a hill\nfor a roller coaster. We follow the current around the circuit starting at any point.\nWe choose to start at point d and follow a small positive test charge completely\naround this circuit. As we go, we note all changes in potential. When the test\ncharge returns to point d, the potential will be the same as when we started (total\nchange in potential around the circuit is zero). We plot the changes in potential\naround the circuit in Fig. 19-12b; point d is arbitrarily taken as zero.\nFIGURE 19-12 Changes in\npotential around the circuit in (a)\nare plotted in (b).\n400 52\nb\na\n290 £2\nC\nI\n+\n–\n(a)\ne\n12.0 V\nd\ne\na\n12\nAs our positive test charge goes from point d, which is the negative or low\npotential side of the battery, to point e, which is the positive terminal (high poten-\ntial side) of the battery, the potential increases by 12.0 V.

Because this is a decrease\nin potential, we use a negative sign:\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nBe consistent with signs when\napplying the loop rule\nVba = Vb - Va = - 7.0 V.\nAs the charge proceeds from b to c there is another potential decrease (a "voltage\ndrop") of (0.0174 A) X (290 (2) = 5.0 V, and this too is a decrease in potential:\nVcb = - 5.0 V.\nThere is no change in potential as our test charge moves from c to d as we assume\nnegligible resistance in the wires.\nThe sum of all the changes in potential around the circuit of Fig. 19-12 is\n+12.0 V - 7.0V - 5.0V = 0.\nThis is exactly what Kirchhoff\'s loop rule said it would be.\nSECTION 19-3 Kirchhoff\'s Rules 533\n', 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': "ING\nKirchhoff's Rules\n`PROBLEM\n1.

Label the currents and their directions. Figure 19-13 uses the labels I1, I2,\nand I3 for the current in the three separate branches. Since (positive) current\ntends to move away from the positive terminal of a battery, we choose I2 and\nI3 to have the directions shown in Fig. 19-13. The direction of I1 is not obvious\nin advance, so we arbitrarily chose the direction indicated. If the current\nactually flows in the opposite direction, our answer will have a negative sign.\n2. Identify the unknowns. We have three unknowns (I1, I2, and I3) and therefore\nwe need three equations, which we get by applying Kirchhoff's junction and\nloop rules.\n3.

Loop rule: We apply Kirchhoff's loop rule to two different closed loops. First\nwe apply it to the upper loop ahdcba. We start (and end) at point a. From\na to h we have a potential decrease Vha = - (11)(30 (2). From h to d there is no\nchange, but from d to c the potential increases by 45 V: that is, Vcd = +45 V.\nFrom c to a the potential decreases through the two resistances by an amount\nVac =- (13)(4002+ 12) = - (41 (2)13. Thus we have Vha + Ved + Vac = 0,\nor\n-30/1 + 45 - 4113 = 0,\n(ii)\nwhere we have omitted the units (volts and amps) so we can more easily see\nthe algebra. For our second loop, we take the outer loop ahdefga. (We could\nhave chosen the lower loop abcdefga instead.) Again we start at point a, and\ngoing to point h we have Vha = - (11)(30 (2). Next, Vdh = 0. But when we\ntake our positive test charge from d to e, it actually is going uphill, against the\ncurrent-or at least against the assumed direction of the current, which is\nwhat counts in this calculation. Thus Ved = +12(20 (2) has a positive sign.\nSimilarly, Vfe = +I2(1 (2). From f to g there is a decrease in potential of\n80 V because we go from the high potential terminal of the battery to the low.\nThus Vef = - 80 V.

On\nthe other hand, when a 20-V and a 12-V battery are connected oppositely, as shown\nin Fig. 19-14b, the net voltage Vca is 8 V (ignoring voltage drop across internal\nresistances). That is, a positive test charge moved from a to b gains in potential\nby 20 V, but when it passes from b to c it drops by 12 V. So the net change is\n20 V - 12 V = 8 V. You might think that connecting batteries in reverse like\nthis would be wasteful. For most purposes that would be true. But such a reverse\narrangement is precisely how a battery charger works. In Fig. 19-14b, the 20-V\nsource is charging up the 12-V battery. Because of its greater voltage, the\n20-V source is forcing charge back into the 12-V battery: electrons are being\nforced into its negative terminal and removed from its positive terminal.\nI\n20 V\n12 V\nb\nc\n(b)\na\n–\n+\n+\n–\nR\n12 V\nI\nAn automobile alternator keeps the car battery charged in the same way.\nA voltmeter placed across the terminals of a (12-V) car battery with the engine\nrunning fairly fast can tell you whether or not the alternator is charging the\nbattery.

The following (cautious) procedure applies if\nthe negative (-) terminal is ground (attached by a cable to the metal car frame\nand motor), and the "hot" terminal is positive (+) on both batteries, as is the case\nfor most modern cars. The + terminal is usually marked by a red color, often a red\ncover. The safest procedure is to first connect the hot (+) terminal of the weak\nbattery to the hot terminal of the good battery (using the cable with red clamps).\nSpread apart the handles of each clamp to squeeze the contact tightly. Then\nconnect the black cable, first to the ground terminal of the good battery, and the\nother end to a clean exposed metal part (i.e., at ground) on the car with the weak\nbattery. (This last connection should preferably be not too close to the battery, which\nin rare cases might leak H2 gas that could ignite at the spark that may accompany\nthe final connection.) This is safer than connecting directly to the ground terminal.\nWhen you are ready to start the disabled car, it helps to have the good car running\n(to keep its battery fully charged).

We first consider a parallel connection as shown in Fig. 19-17. If\na battery supplies a potential difference V to points a and b, this same potential\ndifference V = Vab exists across each of the capacitors. That is, since the left-\nhand plates of all the capacitors are connected by conductors, they all reach the\nsame potential Va when connected to the battery; and the right-hand plates each\nreach potential Vp . Each capacitor plate acquires a charge given by Q1 = C1V,\nQ2 = C2V, and Q3 = C3 V. The total charge Q that must leave the battery is then\nQ = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 = C1V + C2V + C3V.\nLet us try to find a single equivalent capacitor that will hold the same charge Q at\nthe same voltage V = Vab . It will have a capacitance Ceq given by\nQ = CeqV.\nCombining the two previous equations, we have\nCeqV = CIV + C2V + C3V = (C1 + C2 + C3)V\nor\nCeq = C1 + C2 + C3.\n[parallel] (19-5)\nThe net effect of connecting capacitors in parallel is thus to increase the capaci-\ntance. Connecting capacitors in parallel is essentially increasing the area of the\nplates where charge can accumulate (see, for example, Eq. 17-8).\nCapacitors can also be connected in series: that is, end to end as shown in\nFig. 19-18. A charge +Q flows from the battery to one plate of C1, and -Q flows\nto one plate of C3 . The regions A and B between the capacitors were originally\nneutral, so the net charge there must still be zero. The +Q on the left plate of C1\nattracts a charge of -Q on the opposite plate. Because region A must have a zero\nnet charge, there is +Q on the left plate of C2 . The same considerations apply to\nthe other capacitors, so we see that the charge on each capacitor plate has the same\nmagnitude Q. A single capacitor that could replace these three in series without\naffecting the circuit (that is, Q and V the same) would have a capacitance Ceq where\nQ = CeqV.\nThe total voltage V across the three capacitors in series must equal the sum of the\nvoltages across each capacitor:\nV = V1 + V2 + V3 .\nWe also have for each capacitor Q = C1V1, Q = C2V2, and Q = C3 V3, so we\nsubstitute for V1, V2, V3, and V into the last equation and get\n& & + + & -e(+)\nor\nde - a+ + d\n[series] (19-6)\nNotice that the equivalent capacitance Ceq is smaller than the smallest contributing\ncapacitance.

That is, we\nfind the charge Q that leaves the battery, using the equivalent capacitance.\nThen we find the charge on each separate capacitor and the voltage across each.\nEach step uses Eq. 17-7, Q = CV.\nSOLUTION The 4.0-V battery behaves as if it is connected to a capacitance\nCeq =3C = {(3.0 uF) = 2.0 uF. Therefore the charge Q that leaves the battery,\nby Eq. 17-7, is\nQ = CV = (2.0 uF)(4.0V) = 8.0 uC.\nFrom Fig. 19-19a, this charge arrives at the negative plate of C1, so Q1 = 8.0 uC.\nThe charge Q that leaves the positive plate of the battery is split evenly between\nC2 and C3 (symmetry: C2 = C3) and is Q2 = Q3 = 2Q = 4.0 uC. Next, the volt-\nages across C2 and C3 have to be the same. The voltage across each capacitor is\nobtained using V = Q/C. So\nV1 = Q1/C1 = (8.0 uC)/(3.0 uF) = 2.7V\nV2 = Q2/C2 = (4.0 uC)/(3.0 uF) = 1.3 V\nV3 = Q3/C3 = (4.0 uC)/(3.0 uF) = 1.3 V.\n19-6 RC Circuits-Resistor and\nCapacitor in Series\nCapacitor Charging\nCapacitors and resistors are often found together in a circuit. Such RC circuits are\ncommon in everyday life. They are used to control the speed of a car\'s windshield\nwipers and the timing of traffic lights; they are used in camera flashes, in heart\npacemakers, and in many other electronic devices. In RC circuits, we are not so\ninterested in the final "steady state" voltage and charge on the capacitor, but rather\nin how these variables change in time.\nSECTION 19-6 RC Circuits-Resistor and Capacitor in Series 539\n', 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 15, 'type': 'text', 'content': "CAUTION\nDon't confuse e for exponential\nwith e for electron charge\nFIGURE 19-20 After the switch S\ncloses in the RC circuit shown in (a),\nthe voltage Vc across the capacitor\nincreases with time as shown in (b),\nand the current through the resistor\ndecreases with time as shown in (c).\n(b)\nR\nT = RC.\n(19-7c)\n–\n90\nC=\n+\n(a)\nS\n90\nV\n0.638\nt=0 t= RC\n2RC\nTime\n3RC\n&IR\nA simple RC circuit is shown in Fig. 19-20a. When the switch S is closed,\ncurrent immediately begins to flow through the circuit. Electrons will flow out\nfrom the negative terminal of the battery, through the resistor R, and accumulate\non the upper plate of the capacitor. And electrons will flow into the positive\nterminal of the battery, leaving a positive charge on the other plate of the\ncapacitor. As charge accumulates on the capacitor, the potential difference\nacross it increases (Vc = Q/C), and the current is reduced until eventually the\nvoltage across the capacitor equals the emf of the battery, 8. There is then no\nfurther current flow, and no potential difference across the resistor. The potential\ndifference Vc across the capacitor, which is proportional to the charge on it\n(Vc = Q/C, Eq. 17-7), thus increases in time as shown in Fig. 19-20b. The shape\nof this curve is a type of exponential, and is given by the formula+\nVc = %(1 -e-t/RC),\n(19-7a)\nwhere we use the subscript c to remind us that Vc is the voltage across the\ncapacitor and is given here as a function of time t. [The constant e, known as the\nbase for natural logarithms, has the value e = 2.718 .... Do not confuse this e with\ne for the charge on the electron.]\nWe can write a similar formula for the charge Q (= CVc) on the capacitor:\nQ = Q0(1 - e-t/RC),\n(19-7b)\nwhere Q0 represents the maximum charge.\nThe product of the resistance R times the capacitance C, which appears in\nthe exponent, is called the time constant T of the circuit:\nThe time constant is a measure of how quickly the capacitor becomes charged.\n[The units of RC are Q.F = (V/A)(C/V) = C/(C/s) = s.] Specifically, it\ncan be shown that the product RC gives the time required for the capacitor's\nvoltage (and charge) to reach 63% of the maximum. This can be checked+\nusing any calculator with an ex key: e-1 = 0.37, so for t = RC, then\n(1 - e-t/RC) = (1 - e-1) = (1 - 0.37) = 0.63. In a circuit, for example, where\nR = 200 k( and C = 3.0 uF, the time constant is (2.0 × 105 (2)(3.0 × 10-6F) =\n0.60 s. If the resistance is much smaller, the time constant is much smaller and\nthe capacitor becomes charged much more quickly. This makes sense, because\na lower resistance will retard the flow of charge less. All circuits contain some\nresistance (if only in the connecting wires), so a capacitor can never be charged\ninstantaneously when connected to a battery.\nFinally, what is the voltage VR across the resistor in Fig. 19-20a? The imposed\nbattery voltage is %, so\nt\nVR = % - Vc = &(1 - 1 + e-t/RC) = &e-t/ RC\nThis is called an exponential decay.

As charge builds on\nthe capacitor, the current decreases in time. That is exactly what Eq. 19-7d and\nFig. 19-20c tell us.\nt\n*The derivation uses calculus.\n*More simply, since e = 2.718 ··· , then e-1 = 1/e = 1/2.718 = 0.37.

Determine (a) the time constant, (b) the maximum charge the\ncapacitor could acquire, (c) the time it takes for the charge to reach 99% of this\nvalue, and (d) the maximum current.\nAPPROACH We use Fig. 19-20 and Eqs. 19-7a, b, c, and d.\nSOLUTION (a) The time constant is RC = (2.0 × 104 (2)(3.0× 10-7F) =\n6.0 × 10-3s=6.0ms.\n(b) The maximum charge would occur when no further current flows, so\nQ0= C8= (3.0× 10-7F)(12V) = 3.6 uC.\n(c) In Eq. 19-7b, we set Q = 0.99C8:\n0.990% = C8(1 -e-t/RC),\nor\ne-t/RC = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01.\nWe take the natural logarithm of both sides (Appendix A-8), recalling that\nIn eł = x:\nSO\nt\n= - ln(0.01) = 4.6\nRC\nt = 4.6RC = (4.6)(6.0 × 10-3s) = 28× 10-3 s\nor 28 ms (less than 30 s).\n(d) The current is a maximum at t = 0 (the moment when the switch is closed)\nand there is no charge yet on the capacitor (Q = 0):\nImax = =\n2.0×1042\n12 V\n= 600 uA.\nCapacitor Discharging\nThe circuit just discussed involved the charging of a capacitor by a battery\nthrough a resistance. Now let us look at another situation: a capacitor is already\ncharged to a voltage V 0 and charge Q0 , and it is then allowed to discharge through\na resistance R as shown in Fig. 19-21a. In this case there is no battery. When the\nswitch S is closed, charge begins to flow through resistor R from one side of\nthe capacitor toward the other side, until the capacitor is fully discharged.\nThe voltage across the capacitor decreases, as shown in Fig. 19-21b. This\n"exponential decay" curve is given by\nFIGURE 19-21 For the RC circuit\nshown in (a), the voltage Vc across\nthe capacitor decreases with time t,\nas shown in (b), after the switch S is\nclosed at t = 0.

The voltage falls 63% of the\nway to zero (to 0.37Vo) in a time T = RC. Because the charge Q on the capacitor\nis Q = CV (and Q0 = CV0), we can write\nQ = Qoe-t/RC\nfor a discharging capacitor, where Q0 is the initial charge.\nThe voltage across the resistor will have the same magnitude as that across\nthe capacitor at any instant, but the opposite sign, because there is zero applied\nemf: Vc + VR = 0 so VR = - Vc = - Voe-t/RC. A graph of VR VS. time would just\nbe Fig. 19-21b upside down.

In the circuit of\nFig. 19-22, the capacitor is originally uncharged. Describe the behavior of the\nlightbulb from the instant switch S is closed until a long time later.\nRESPONSE When the switch is first closed, the current in the circuit is high and\nthe lightbulb burns brightly. As the capacitor charges, the voltage across the capac-\nitor increases, causing the current to be reduced, and the lightbulb dims. As\nthe potential difference across the capacitor approaches the same voltage as the\nbattery, the current decreases toward zero and the lightbulb goes out.\nMedical and Other Applications of RC Circuits\nThe charging and discharging in an RC circuit can be used to produce voltage\npulses at a regular frequency. The charge on the capacitor increases to a particular\nvoltage, and then discharges. One way of initiating the discharge of the capacitor\nis by the use of a gas-filled tube which has an electrical breakdown when the\nvoltage across it reaches a certain value V0 . After the discharge is finished, the\ntube no longer conducts current and the recharging process repeats itself, starting\nat a lower voltage V6. Figure 19-23 shows a possible circuit, and the sawtooth\nvoltage it produces.\nA simple blinking light can be an application of a sawtooth oscillator circuit.\nHere the emf is supplied by a battery; the neon bulb flashes on at a rate of perhaps\n1 cycle per second. The main component of a "flasher unit" is a moderately large\ncapacitor.\nV\nR\nC\nFIGURE 19-23 (a) An RC circuit,\ncoupled with a gas-filled tube as a\nswitch, can produce (b) a repeating\n"sawtooth" voltage.\nR\nV0\n+\n90\n–\n(a)\nVỏ\nGas-filled\ntube\n0\nTime\n(b)\n542 CHAPTER 19\n', 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'The intermittent windshield wipers of a car can also use an RC circuit.

Estimate the resistance in the circuit, assuming a moderate\ncapacitor of C = 1 uF.\nAn important medical use of an RC circuit is the electronic heart pacemaker,\nwhich can make a stopped heart start beating again by applying an electric stim-\nulus through electrodes attached to the chest. The stimulus can be repeated at the\nnormal heartbeat rate if necessary. The heart itself contains pacemaker cells,\nwhich send out tiny electric pulses at a rate of 60 to 80 per minute. These signals\ninduce the start of each heartbeat. In some forms of heart disease, the natural\npacemaker fails to function properly, and the heart loses its beat. Such patients\nuse electronic pacemakers which produce a regular voltage pulse that starts and\ncontrols the frequency of the heartbeat. The electrodes are implanted in or near\nthe heart (Fig. 19-24), and the circuit contains a capacitor and a resistor. The\ncharge on the capacitor increases to a certain point and then discharges a pulse\nto the heart. Then it starts charging again. The pulsing rate depends on the time\nconstant RC.\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nWindshield wipers on "intermittent"\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nHeart pacemaker\nRIGHT\n19-7 Electric Hazards\nExcess electric current can overheat wires in buildings and cause fires, as discussed\nin Section 18-6. Electric current can also damage the human body or even be fatal.\nElectric current through the human body can cause damage in two ways: (1) heating\ntissue and causing burns; (2) stimulating nerves and muscles, and we feel a "shock."\nThe severity of a shock depends on the magnitude of the current, how long it acts,\nand through what part of the body it passes. A current passing through vital organs\nsuch as the heart or brain is especially damaging.\nA current of about 1 mA or more can be felt and may cause pain. Currents\nabove 10 mA cause severe contraction of the muscles, and a person may not be\nable to let go of the source of the current (say, a faulty appliance or wire). Death\nfrom paralysis of the respiratory system can occur. Artificial respiration can\nsometimes revive a victim. If a current above about 80 to 100 mA passes across\nthe torso, so that a portion passes through the heart for more than a second or\ntwo, the heart muscles will begin to contract irregularly and blood will not be\nproperly pumped. This condition is called ventricular fibrillation. If it lasts for\nlong, death results. Strangely enough, if the current is much larger, on the order\nof 1 A, death by heart failure may be less likely,+ but such currents can cause\nserious burns if concentrated through a small area of the body.\nIt is current that harms, but it is voltage that drives the current. The serious-\nness of an electric shock depends on the current and thus on the applied voltage\nand the effective resistance of the body. Living tissue has low resistance because\nthe fluid of cells contains ions that can conduct quite well. However, the outer\nlayer of skin, when dry, offers high resistance and is thus protective. The effective\nresistance between two points on opposite sides of the body when the skin is dry\nis on the order of 104 to 106 (2. But when the skin is wet, the resistance may be 103 (2\nor less. A person who is barefoot or wearing thin-soled shoes will be in good contact\nwith the ground, and touching a 120-V line with a wet hand can result in a current\nI = 1000 Q\n120 V\n= 120 mA.\nAs we saw, this could be lethal.\n+Larger currents apparently bring the entire heart to a standstill. Upon release of the current, the\nheart returns to its normal rhythm. This may not happen when fibrillation occurs because, once\nstarted, it can be hard to stop. Fibrillation may also occur as a result of a heart attack or during heart\nsurgery. A device known as a defibrillator (described in Section 17-9) can apply a brief high current to\nthe heart, causing complete heart stoppage which is often followed by resumption of normal beating.\nFIGURE 19-24 Electronic battery-\npowered pacemaker can be seen on\nthe rib cage in this X-ray (color added).\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nDangers of electricity\nSECTION 19-7 Electric Hazards 543\n', 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 19, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'I\n120 V\nSAARA\n(a)\n"Yikes!"\n(b)\nFIGURE 19-25 You can receive a\nshock when the circuit is completed.\nCAUTION\nKeep one hand in your pocket\nwhen other touches electricity\nK\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nGrounding and shocks\n(a)\nYou can get a shock by becoming part of a complete circuit. Figure 19-25\nshows two ways the circuit might be completed when you accidentally touch a\n"hot" electric wire-"hot" meaning a high potential relative to ground such as\n120 V (normal U.S. household voltage) or 240 V (many other countries). The\nother wire of building wiring is connected to ground-either by a wire connected\nto a buried conductor, or via a metal water pipe into the ground. The current in\nFig. 19-25a passes from the high-voltage wire through you to ground through\nyour bare feet, and back along the ground (a fair conductor) to the ground ter-\nminal of the source. If you stand on a good insulator-thick rubber-soled shoes\nor a dry wood floor-there will be much more resistance in the circuit and much\nless current through you. If you stand with bare feet on the ground, or in a bathtub,\nthere is lethal danger because the resistance is much less and the current greater.\nIn a bathtub (or swimming pool), not only are you wet, which reduces your\nresistance, but the water is in contact with the drain pipe (typically metal) that\nleads to the ground. It is strongly recommended that you not touch anything\nelectrical when wet or in bare feet. The use of non-metal pipes would be protective.\nIn Fig. 19-25b, a person touches a faulty "hot" wire with one hand, and the other\nhand touches a sink faucet (connected to ground via the pipe or even by water in\na non-metal pipe). The current is particularly dangerous because it passes across\nthe chest, through the heart and lungs. A useful rule: if one hand is touching\nsomething electrical, keep your other hand in your back pocket (don\'t use it!),\nand wear thick rubber-soled shoes. Also remove metal jewelry, especially rings\n(your finger is usually moist under a ring).\nYou can come into contact with a hot wire by touching a bare wire whose insu-\nlation has worn off, or from a bare wire inside an appliance when you\'re tinkering\nwith it. (Always unplug an electrical device before investigating its insides!)+ Also,\na wire inside a device may break or lose its insulation and come in contact with the\ncase. If the case is metal, it will conduct electricity. A person could then suffer a\nsevere shock merely by touching the case, as shown in Fig. 19-26b.

Then if a "hot" wire touches the grounded case, a short\ncircuit to ground immediately occurs internally, as shown in Fig. 19-26c, and most\nof the current passes through the low-resistance ground wire rather than through\nthe person. Furthermore, the high current should open a fuse or circuit breaker.\nGrounding a metal case is done by a separate ground wire connected to the third\n(round) prong of a 3-prong plug. Never cut off the third prong of a plug-it could\nsave your life. A three-prong plug, and an adapter, are shown in Figs. 19-27a and b.\n+Even then you can get a bad shock from a capacitor that hasn\'t been discharged until you touch it.\nFIGURE 19-27 (a) A 3-prong plug,\nand (b) an adapter (white) for old-\nfashioned 2-prong outlets-be sure to\nscrew down the ground tab (green color\nin photo).\nI\n544 CHAPTER 19 DC Circuits\n(a)\n(b)\n', 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 20, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Safe Wiring\nWhy is a third wire needed? The 120 V is carried by the other two wires-one\nhot (120 V ac), the other neutral, which is itself grounded. The third "dedicated"\nground wire with the round prong may seem redundant. But it is protection for\ntwo reasons: (1) It protects against internal wiring that may have been done\nincorrectly or is faulty as discussed above, Fig. 19-26. (2) The neutral wire carries\nthe full normal current ("return" current from the hot 120 V) and it does have\nresistance-so there can be a voltage drop along the neutral wire, normally\nsmall; but if connections are poor or corroded, or the plug is loose, the resistance\ncould be large enough that you might feel that voltage if you touched the neutral\nwire some distance from its grounding point.\nSome electrical devices come with only two wires, and the plug\'s two prongs\nare of different widths; the plug can be inserted only one way into the outlet so\nthat the intended neutral (wider prong) in the device is connected to neutral in\nthe wiring (Fig. 19-28). For example, the screw threads of a lightbulb are meant\nto be connected to neutral (and the base contact to hot), to avoid shocks when\nchanging a bulb in a possibly protruding socket. Devices with 2-prong plugs do\nnot have their cases grounded; they are supposed to have double electric insulation\n(or have a nonmetal case). Take extra care anyway.\nThe insulation on a wire may be color coded. Hand-held meters (Section 19-8)\nmay have red (hot) and black (ground) lead wires. But in a U.S. house, the hot\nwire is often black (though it may be red), whereas white is neutral and green (or\nbare) is the dedicated ground, Fig. 19-29. But beware: these color codes cannot\nalways be trusted.\n[In the U.S., three wires normally enter a house: two hot wires at 120 V each\n(which add together to 240 V for appliances or devices that run on 240 V) plus\nthe grounded neutral (carrying return current for the two hot wires). See\nFig. 19-29. The "dedicated" ground wire (non-current carrying) is a fourth wire\nthat does not come from the electric company but enters the house from a nearby\nheavy stake in the ground or a buried metal pipe. The two hot wires can feed\nseparate 120-V circuits in the house, so each 120-V circuit inside the house has\nonly three wires, including the dedicated ground.]\nNormal circuit breakers (Sections 18-6 and 20-7) protect equipment and build-\nings from overload and fires. They protect humans only in some circumstances, such\nas the very high currents that result from a short, if they respond quickly enough.\nGround fault circuit interrupters (GFCI or GFI), described in Section 21-9, are\ndesigned to protect people from the much lower currents (10 mA to 100 mA) that\nare lethal but would not throw a 15-A circuit breaker or blow a 20-A fuse.\nAnother danger is leakage current, by which we mean a current along an\nunintended path. Leakage currents are often "capacitively coupled." For example,\na wire in a lamp forms a capacitor with the metal case; charges moving in one con-\nductor attract or repel charge in the other, so there is a current. Typical electrical\ncodes limit leakage currents to 1 mA for any device, which is usually harmless.\nIt could be dangerous, however, to a hospital patient with implanted electrodes,\ndue to the absence of the protective skin layer and because the current can\npass directly through the heart. Although 100 mA may be needed to cause heart\nfibrillation when entering through the hands and spreading out through the body\n(very little of it actually passing through the heart), but as little as 0.02 mA can\ncause fibrillation when passing directly to the heart. Thus, a "wired" patient is in\nconsiderable danger from leakage current even from as simple an act as touching\na lamp.\nFinally, don\'t touch a downed power line (lethal!) or even get near it. A hot\npower line is at thousands of volts. A huge current can flow along the ground\nfrom the point where the high-voltage wire touches the ground. This current is great\nenough that the voltage between your two feet could be large and dangerous.\nTip: stand on one foot, or run so only one foot touches the ground at a time.\nCAUTION\nNecessity of third (ground) wire\nFIGURE 19-28 A polarized\n2-prong plug.\nCAUTION\nBlack wire may be either\nground or hot.

Measuring instruments can not be taken for granted; their results are not\nperfect and often need to be interpreted. As an illustration of measurement\n"theory" we examine here how electrical quantities are measured using meters.\nWe also examine how meters affect the quantity they attempt to measure.\nAn ammeter measures current, and a voltmeter measures potential difference\nor voltage. Each can be either: (1) an analog meter, which displays numerical\nvalues by the position of a pointer that can move across a scale (Fig. 19-30a); or\n(2) a digital meter, which displays the numerical value in numbers (Fig. 19-30b).\nWe now examine how analog meters work.\nAn analog ammeter or voltmeter, in which the reading is by a pointer on a scale\n(Fig. 19-30a), uses a galvanometer. A galvanometer works on the principle of the\nforce between a magnetic field and a current-carrying coil of wire; it is straight-\nforward to understand and will be discussed in Chapter 20. For now, we only need to\nknow that the deflection of the needle of a galvanometer is proportional to the current\nflowing through it. The full-scale current sensitivity of a galvanometer, Im , is the\nelectric current needed to make the needle deflect full scale, typically about 50 uA.\nA galvanometer whose sensitivity Im is 50 uA can measure currents from\nabout 1 uA (currents smaller than this would be hard to read on the scale) up to\n50 uA. To measure larger currents, a resistor is placed in parallel with the\ngalvanometer. An analog ammeter, represented by the symbol .A., consists of a\ngalvanometer (·G .) in parallel with a resistor called the shunt resistor, as shown in\nFig. 19-31. ("Shunt" is a synonym for "in parallel.") The shunt resistance is Rsh,\nand the resistance of the galvanometer coil is r. The value of Rsh is chosen according\nto the full-scale deflection desired; Rsh is normally very small-giving an ammeter\na very small net resistance-so most of the current passes through Rsh and very\nlittle (≤ 50 uA) passes through the galvanometer to deflect the needle.\nEXAMPLE 19-15\nAmmeter design. Design an ammeter to read 1.0 A at\nfull scale using a galvanometer with a full-scale sensitivity of 50 uA and a\nresistance r = 300. Check if the scale is linear.\nAPPROACH Only 50 uA (= IG = 0.000050 A) of the 1.0-A current passes\nthrough the galvanometer to give full-scale deflection. The rest of the current\n(IR = 0.999950 A) passes through the small shunt resistor, Rsh , Fig. 19-31. The\npotential difference across the galvanometer equals that across the shunt\nresistor (they are in parallel). We apply Ohm\'s law to find Rsh .\nSOLUTION Because I = IG + IR, when I = 1.0 A flows into the meter, we\nwant IR through the shunt resistor to be IR = 0.999950 A. The potential differ-\nence across the shunt is the same as across the galvanometer, so\nThen\nRsh =\nIR Rsh = IGr.\nIR\nIGr\n=\n(5.0×10-5A)(30(2)\n=\n1.5 × 10-30,\n(0.999950 A)\nor 0.0015 Q. The shunt resistor must thus have a very low resistance and most of\nthe current passes through it.\nBecause IG = IR (Rsh/r) and (Rsh/r) is constant, we see that the scale is\nlinear (needle deflection is proportional to IG). If the current I ~ IR into the\nmeter is half of full scale, 0.50 A, the current to the galvanometer will be\nIG= IR(Rsh/r)=(0.50A)(1.5× 10-3(2)/(30(2) = 25 uA, which would make\nthe needle deflect halfway, as it should.\nAn analog voltmeter ( .. ) consists of a galvanometer and a resistor Rser con-\nnected in series, Fig. 19-32. Rser is usually large, giving a voltmeter a high internal\nresistance.\n546 CHAPTER 19 DC Circuits\n', 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 22, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'EXAMPLE 19-16\nVoltmeter design. Using a galvanometer with internal\nresistance r = 30 0 and full-scale current sensitivity of 50 uA, design a voltmeter\nthat reads from 0 to 15 V. Is the scale linear?\nAPPROACH When a potential difference of 15 V exists across the terminals of our\nvoltmeter, we want 50 uA to be passing through it so as to give a full-scale deflection.\nSOLUTION From Ohm\'s law, V = IR, we have (Fig. 19-32)\n15V = (50 uA)(r + Rser),\nSO\nRser = (15 V)/(5.0 X 10-5A) - r = 300kQ -300~300kΩ.\nNotice that r = 30 02 is so small compared to the value of Rser that it doesn\'t\ninfluence the calculation significantly. The scale will again be linear: if the volt-\nage to be measured is 6.0 V, the current passing through the voltmeter will be\n(6.0V)/(3.0× 105(2) = 2.0 × 10-5 A, or 20 A. This will produce two-fifths\nof full-scale deflection, as required (6.0 V/15.0 V = 2/5).\nHow to Connect Meters\nSuppose you wish to determine the current I in the circuit shown in Fig. 19-33a,\nand the voltage V across the resistor R1 . How exactly are ammeters and volt-\nmeters connected to the circuit being measured?\nBecause an ammeter is used to measure the current flowing in the circuit, it\nmust be inserted directly into the circuit, in series with the other elements, as shown\nin Fig. 19-33b. The smaller its internal resistance, the less it affects the circuit.\nA voltmeter is connected "externally," in parallel with the circuit element across\nwhich the voltage is to be measured. It measures the potential difference between\ntwo points. Its two wire leads (connecting wires) are connected to the two points, as\nshown in Fig. 19-33c, where the voltage across R1 is being measured. The larger its\ninternal resistance (Rser + r, Fig. 19-32), the less it affects the circuit being measured.\nEffects of Meter Resistance\nIt is important to know the sensitivity of a meter, for in many cases the resistance\nof the meter can seriously affect your results. Consider the following Example.\nEXAMPLE 19-17\nVoltage reading vs. true voltage. An electronic circuit has\ntwo 15-k2 resistors, R1 and R2, connected in series, Fig. 19-34a. The battery voltage\nis 8.0 V and it has negligible internal resistance. A voltmeter has resistance\nof 50 k2 on the 5.0-V scale. What voltage does the meter read when connected\nacross R1, Fig. 19-34b, and what error is caused by the meter\'s finite resistance?\nAPPROACH The meter acts as a resistor in parallel with R1. We use parallel\nand series resistor analyses and Ohm\'s law to find currents and voltages.\nSOLUTION The voltmeter resistance of 50,000 (2 is in parallel with R1 = 15 k2,\nFig. 19-34b. The net resistance Reg of these two is\n1\n=\n1\n+\n1\n13\n150 kQ\'\n=\nReq\n50 kQ\n15 k2\nso Req = 11.5 kQ. This Req = 11.5 kQ is in series with R2 = 15 kQ, so the total\nresistance is now 26.5 k(2 (not the original 30 k(2). Hence the current from\nthe battery is\nI =\n8.0V\n= 3.0 ×10-4A = 0.30mA.\n26.5 k2\nThen the voltage drop across R1, which is the same as that across the voltmeter,\nis (3.0×10-4 A)(11.5 × 103 (2) =3.5V. [The voltage drop across R2 is\n(3.0 × 10-4 A)(15 × 103 (2) = 4.5 V, for a total of 8.0 V.] If we assume the meter is\naccurate, it reads 3.5 V. In the original circuit, without the meter, R1 = R2 so the\nvoltage across R1 is half that of the battery, or 4.0 V. Thus the voltmeter, because\nof its internal resistance, gives a low reading. It is off by 0.5 V, or more than 10%.\nNOTE Often the sensitivity of a voltmeter is specified on its face as, for example,\n10,000 2/V. Then on a 5.0-V scale, the voltmeter would have a resistance given by\n(5.0 V) (10,000 Ω/V) = 50,000 Ω. The meter\'s resistance depends on the scale used.\nVoltmeter\nV\n=\nRser\nr\nG\nFIGURE 19-32 A voltmeter is a\ngalvanometer in series with a resistor\nwith high resistance, Rser ·\nFIGURE 19-33 Measuring current\nand voltage.\na\n0\nR\nR2\nV\n(a)\na\nb\nc\nR1\nR2\nA\nV\n(b)\nV\nb\nR2\nc\na\nR1\nV\n(c)\nPHYSICS APPLIED\nCorrecting for meter resistance\nFIGURE 19-34 Example 19-17.\nb\na\nC\nR1\nR2\nV\n(a)\nV\na +\nR\nb\nR2\nc\nV\n(b)\nSECTION 19-8 547\n', 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 23, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'CAUTION\nMeasurements affect the\nquantity being measured\nr\n1\nG\nRsh\nR\nser\nV\nR to be\nmeasured\nFIGURE 19-35 An ohmmeter.\n-\nExample 19-17 illustrates how seriously a meter can affect a circuit and give\na misleading reading. If the resistance of a voltmeter is much higher than the\nresistance of the circuit, however, it will have little effect and its readings can be\nmore accurate, at least to the manufactured precision of the meter, which for\nanalog meters is typically 3% to 4% of full-scale deflection. Even an ammeter can\ninterfere with a circuit, but the effect is minimal if its resistance is much less than\nthat of the circuit as a whole. For both voltmeters and ammeters, the more sensi-\ntive the galvanometer, the less effect it will have on the circuit. [A 50,000-2/V\nmeter is far better than a 1000-2/V meter.]\nWhenever we make a measurement on a circuit, to some degree we affect\nthat circuit (Example 19-17). This is true for other types of measurement as well:\nwhen we make a measurement on a system, we affect that system in some way.\nOn a temperature measurement, for example, the thermometer can exchange\nheat with the system, thus altering the temperature it is measuring. It is important\nto be able to make needed corrections, as we saw in Example 19-17.\nOther Meters\nThe meters described above are for direct current. A dc meter can be modified\nto measure ac (alternating current, Section 18-7) with the addition of diodes\n(Chapter 29), which allow current to flow in one direction only. An ac meter can\nbe calibrated to read rms or peak values.\nVoltmeters and ammeters can have several series or shunt resistors to offer a\nchoice of range. Multimeters can measure voltage, current, and resistance. Some-\ntimes a multimeter is called a VOM (Volt-Ohm-Meter or Volt-Ohm-Milliammeter).\nAn ohmmeter measures resistance, and must contain a battery of known\nvoltage connected in series to a resistor (Rser) and to an ammeter which contains a\nshunt Rsh (Fig. 19-35). The resistor whose resistance is to be measured completes\nthe circuit, and must not be connected in a circuit containing a voltage source.\nThe needle deflection of the meter is inversely proportional to the resistance.\nThe scale calibration depends on the value of its series resistor, which is\nchangeable in a multimeter. Because an ohmmeter sends a current through the\ndevice whose resistance is to be measured, it should not be used on very delicate\ndevices that could be damaged by the current.\nDigital Meters\nDigital meters (see Fig. 19-30b) are used in the same way as analog meters: they\nare inserted directly into the circuit, in series, to measure current (Fig. 19-33b),\nand connected "outside," in parallel with the circuit, to measure voltage (Fig. 19-33c).\nThe internal construction of digital meters is very different from analog\nmeters. First, digital meters do not use a galvanometer, but rather semiconductor\ndevices (Chapter 29). The electronic circuitry and digital readout are more\nsensitive than a galvanometer, and have less effect on the circuit to be meas-\nured. When we measure de voltages, a digital meter\'s resistance is very high,\ncommonly on the order of 10 MQ to 100 MQ (107-108 (2), and doesn\'t change\nsignificantly when different voltage scales are selected. A 100-MQ digital meter\ndraws very little current when connected across even a 1-MQ resistance.\nThe precision of digital meters is exceptional, often one part in 104 (= 0.01%)\nor better. This precision is not the same as accuracy, however. A precise meter of\ninternal resistance 108 (2 will not give accurate results if used to measure a voltage\nacross a 108-(2 resistor-in which case it is necessary to do a calculation like that in\nExample 19-17.\n548 CHAPTER 19 DC Circuits\n', 'chapter_title': '19-1 EMF and Terminal Voltage'}, {'page_number': 24, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Summary\nA device that transforms another type of energy into electrical\nenergy is called a source of emf.

To avoid shocks, the body must not become part of a\ncomplete circuit by allowing different parts of the body to touch\nobjects at different potentials.
