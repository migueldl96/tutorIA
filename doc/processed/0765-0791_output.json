The new\nphysics that grew out of the great revolution at the turn of the twentieth century\nis now called modern physics. In this Chapter, we present the special theory of\nrelativity, which was first proposed by Albert Einstein (1879-1955; Fig. 26-1) in\n1905. In Chapter 27, we introduce the equally momentous quantum theory.\n-1-1 -theme by 21 .\n1-0 9-1 2.2'\nFIGURE 26-1 Albert Einstein\n(1879-1955), one of the great minds\nof the twentieth century, was the\ncreator of the special and general\ntheories of relativity.\n26-1 Galilean-Newtonian Relativity\nEinstein's special theory of relativity deals with how we observe events, particu-\nlarly how objects and events are observed from different frames of reference.+\nThis subject had already been explored by Galileo and Newton.\nThe special theory of relativity deals with events that are observed and meas-\nured from so-called inertial reference frames (Section 4-2 and Appendix C),\nwhich are reference frames in which Newton's first law is valid: if an object\nexperiences no net force, the object either remains at rest or continues in motion\nwith constant speed in a straight line. It is usually easiest to analyze events when\nthey are observed and measured by observers at rest in an inertial frame. The\nEarth, though not quite an inertial frame (it rotates), is close enough that for\nmost purposes we can approximate it as an inertial frame. Rotating or otherwise\naccelerating frames of reference are noninertial frames,* and won't concern us in\nthis Chapter (they are dealt with in Einstein's general theory of relativity, as we\nwill see in Chapter 33).\nA reference frame that moves with constant velocity with respect to an\ninertial frame is itself also an inertial frame, since Newton's laws hold in it as well.\nWhen we say that we observe or make measurements from a certain reference\nframe, it means that we are at rest in that reference frame.\n+ A reference frame is a set of coordinate axes fixed to some object such as the Earth, a train, or the\nMoon. See Section 2-1.\n$On a rotating platform (say a merry-go-round), for example, a ball at rest starts moving outward\neven though no object exerts a force on it. This is therefore not an inertial frame.

You may have recognized its validity in everyday life. For\nexample, objects move in the same way in a smoothly moving (constant-velocity)\ntrain or airplane as they do on Earth. (This assumes no vibrations or rocking\nwhich would make the reference frame noninertial.) When you walk, drink a\ncup of soup, play pool, or drop a pencil on the floor while traveling in a train,\nairplane, or ship moving at constant velocity, the objects move just as they do\nwhen you are at rest on Earth. Suppose you are in a car traveling rapidly at\nconstant velocity. If you drop a coin from above your head inside the car, how\nwill it fall? It falls straight downward with respect to the car, and hits the floor\ndirectly below the point of release, Fig. 26-2a. This is just how objects fall on the\nEarth-straight down-and thus our experiment in the moving car is in accord\nwith the relativity principle. (If you drop the coin out the car's window, this won't\nhappen because the moving air drags the coin backward relative to the car.)\nNote in this example, however, that to an observer on the Earth, the coin fol-\nlows a curved path, Fig. 26-2b. The actual path followed by the coin is different\nas viewed from different frames of reference. This does not violate the relativity\nprinciple because this principle states that the laws of physics are the same in\nall inertial frames. The same law of gravity, and the same laws of motion, apply in\nboth reference frames. The acceleration of the coin is the same in both reference\nframes. The difference in Figs. 26-2a and b is that in the Earth's frame of reference,\nthe coin has an initial velocity (equal to that of the car). The laws of physics there-\nfore predict it will follow a parabolic path like any projectile (Chapter 3). In the\ncar's reference frame, there is no initial velocity, and the laws of physics predict\nthat the coin will fall straight down. The laws are the same in both reference frames,\nalthough the specific paths are different.\nGalilean-Newtonian relativity involves certain unprovable assumptions that\nmake sense from everyday experience. It is assumed that the lengths of objects\nare the same in one reference frame as in another, and that time passes at the\nsame rate in different reference frames. In classical mechanics, then, space and\ntime intervals are considered to be absolute: their measurement does not change\nfrom one reference frame to another. The mass of an object, as well as all forces,\nare assumed to be unchanged by a change in inertial reference frame.\nThe position of an object, however, is different when specified in different\nreference frames, and so is velocity. For example, a person may walk inside a bus\ntoward the front with a speed of 2 m/s. But if the bus moves 10 m/s with respect\nto the Earth, the person is then moving with a speed of 12 m/s with respect to the\nEarth. The acceleration of an object, however, is the same in any inertial\nreference frame according to classical mechanics. This is because the change in\nvelocity, and the time interval, will be the same. For example, the person in the\nbus may accelerate from 0 to 2 m/s in 1.0 seconds, so a = 2 m/s2 in the reference\nframe of the bus. With respect to the Earth, the acceleration is\n(12 m/s- 10m/s)/(1.0s) = 2m/s2,\nwhich is the same.\n746 CHAPTER 26\n", 'chapter_title': 'The Special Theory of Relativity'}, {'page_number': 4, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Since neither F, m, nor a changes from one inertial frame to another, Newton\'s\nsecond law, F = ma, does not change. Thus Newtons\' second law satisfies the relativity\nprinciple. The other laws of mechanics also satisfy the relativity principle.\nThat the laws of mechanics are the same in all inertial reference frames\nimplies that no one inertial frame is special in any sense. We express this\nimportant conclusion by saying that all inertial reference frames are equivalent\nfor the description of mechanical phenomena. No one inertial reference frame is\nany better than another. A reference frame fixed to a car or an aircraft traveling\nat constant velocity is as good as one fixed on the Earth. When you travel\nsmoothly at constant velocity in a car or airplane, it is just as valid to say you are\nat rest and the Earth is moving as it is to say the reverse .* There is no experiment\nyou can do to tell which frame is "really" at rest and which is moving. Thus, there\nis no way to single out one particular reference frame as being at absolute rest.\nA complication arose, however, in the last half of the nineteenth century.\nMaxwell\'s comprehensive and successful theory of electromagnetism (Chapter 22)\npredicted that light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell\'s equations gave the\nvelocity of light c as 3.00 × 108 m/s; and this is just what is measured. The\nquestion then arose: in what reference frame does light have precisely the value\npredicted by Maxwell\'s theory? It was assumed that light would have a different\nspeed in different frames of reference. For example, if observers could travel\non a rocket ship at a speed of 1.0 × 108 m/s away from a source of light, we\nmight expect them to measure the speed of the light reaching them to be\n(3.0 × 108 m/s) - (1.0 × 108 m/s) = 2.0 × 108 m/s. But Maxwell\'s equations\nhave no provision for relative velocity. They predicted the speed of light to be\nc = 3.0 × 108 m/s, which seemed to imply that there must be some preferred\nreference frame where c would have this value.\nWe discussed in Chapters 11 and 12 that waves can travel on water and along\nropes or strings, and sound waves travel in air and other materials. Nineteenth-\ncentury physicists viewed the material world in terms of the laws of mechanics, so\nit was natural for them to assume that light too must travel in some medium.\nThey called this transparent medium the ether and assumed it permeated all space .*\nIt was therefore assumed that the velocity of light given by Maxwell\'s equations\nmust be with respect to the ether.$\nScientists soon set out to determine the speed of the Earth relative to this\nabsolute frame, whatever it might be. A number of clever experiments were\ndesigned. The most direct were performed by A. A. Michelson and E. W. Morley\nin the 1880s. They measured the difference in the speed of light in different\ndirections using Michelson\'s interferometer (Section 24-9). They expected to find\na difference depending on the orientation of their apparatus with respect to the\nether. For just as a boat has different speeds relative to the land when it moves\nupstream, downstream, or across the stream, so too light would be expected to\nhave different speeds depending on the velocity of the ether past the Earth.\nStrange as it may seem, they detected no difference at all. This was a great\npuzzle. A number of explanations were put forth over a period of years, but they\nled to contradictions or were otherwise not generally accepted. This null result\nwas one of the great puzzles at the end of the nineteenth century.\nThen in 1905, Albert Einstein proposed a radical new theory that reconciled\nthese many problems in a simple way. But at the same time, as we shall see, it\ncompletely changed our ideas of space and time.\n+We use the reasonable approximation that Earth is an inertial reference frame.\n*The medium for light waves could not be air, since light travels from the Sun to Earth through nearly\nempty space. Therefore, another medium was postulated, the ether. The ether was not only trans-\nparent but, because of difficulty in detecting it, was assumed to have zero density.\n$ Also, it appeared that Maxwell\'s equations did not satisfy the relativity principle: They were simplest\nin the frame where c = 3.00 × 108 m/s, in a reference frame at rest in the ether. In any other\nreference frame, extra terms were needed to account for relative velocity. Although other laws of\nphysics obeyed the relativity principle, the laws of electricity and magnetism apparently did not.\nEinstein\'s second postulate (next Section) resolved this problem: Maxwell\'s equations do satisfy\nrelativity.\nSECTION 26-1 Galilean-Newtonian Relativity 747\n', 'chapter_title': 'The Special Theory of Relativity'}, {'page_number': 5, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'RELATIVITY PRINCIPLE\nSPEED OF LIGHT PRINCIPLE\n26-2 Postulates of the\nSpecial Theory of Relativity\nThe problems that existed at the start of the twentieth century with regard to\nelectromagnetic theory and Newtonian mechanics were beautifully resolved by\nEinstein\'s introduction of the special theory of relativity in 1905. Unaware of the\nMichelson-Morley null result, Einstein was motivated by certain questions\nregarding electromagnetic theory and light waves. For example, he asked himself:\n"What would I see if I rode a light beam?" The answer was that instead of a trav-\neling electromagnetic wave, he would see alternating electric and magnetic fields\nat rest whose magnitude changed in space, but did not change in time. Such fields,\nhe realized, had never been detected and indeed were not consistent with Maxwell\'s\nelectromagnetic theory. He argued, therefore, that it was unreasonable to think\nthat the speed of light relative to any observer could be reduced to zero, or in fact\nreduced at all. This idea became the second postulate of his theory of relativity.\nIn his famous 1905 paper, Einstein proposed doing away with the idea of the\nether and the accompanying assumption of a preferred or absolute reference frame\nat rest. This proposal was embodied in two postulates. The first was an extension\nof the Galilean-Newtonian relativity principle to include not only the laws of\nmechanics but also those of the rest of physics, including electricity and magnetism:\nFirst postulate (the relativity principle): The laws of physics have the same\nform in all inertial reference frames.\nThe first postulate can also be stated as: there is no experiment you can do in an\ninertial reference frame to determine if you are at rest or moving uniformly at\nconstant velocity.\nThe second postulate is consistent with the first:\nSecond postulate (constancy of the speed of light): Light propagates through\nempty space with a definite speed c independent of the speed of the source or\nobserver.\nThese two postulates form the foundation of Einstein\'s special theory of relativity.\nIt is called "special" to distinguish it from his later "general theory of relativity,"\nwhich deals with noninertial (accelerating) reference frames (Chapter 33). The\nspecial theory, which is what we discuss here, deals only with inertial frames.\nThe second postulate may seem hard to accept, for it seems to violate common\nsense. First of all, we have to think of light traveling through empty space. Giving\nup the ether is not too hard, however, since it had never been detected. But the\nsecond postulate also tells us that the speed of light in vacuum is always the same,\n3.00 × 108 m/s, no matter what the speed of the observer or the source. Thus, a per-\nson traveling toward or away from a source of light will measure the same speed\nfor that light as someone at rest with respect to the source. This conflicts with our\neveryday experience: we would expect to have to add in the velocity of the observer.\nOn the other hand, perhaps we can\'t expect our everyday experience to be\nhelpful when dealing with the high velocity of light. Furthermore, the null result of\nthe Michelson-Morley experiment is fully consistent with the second postulate.+\nEinstein\'s proposal has a certain beauty. By doing away with the idea of an\nabsolute reference frame, it was possible to reconcile classical mechanics with\nMaxwell\'s electromagnetic theory. The speed of light predicted by Maxwell\'s\nequations is the speed of light in vacuum in any reference frame.\nEinstein\'s theory required us to give up common sense notions of space and\ntime, and in the following Sections we will examine some strange but interesting con-\nsequences of special relativity. Our arguments for the most part will be simple ones.\n*The Michelson-Morley experiment can also be considered as evidence for the first postulate, since it\nwas intended to measure the motion of the Earth relative to an absolute reference frame. Its failure\nto do so implies the absence of any such preferred frame.\n748 CHAPTER 26 The Special Theory of Relativity\n', 'chapter_title': 'The Special Theory of Relativity'}, {'page_number': 6, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'We will use a technique that Einstein himself did: we will imagine very simple\nexperimental situations in which little mathematics is needed. In this way, we can\nsee many of the consequences of relativity theory without getting involved in\ndetailed calculations. Einstein called these thought experiments.\n26-3 Simultaneity\nAn important consequence of the theory of relativity is that we can no longer\nregard time as an absolute quantity. No one doubts that time flows onward and\nnever turns back. But according to relativity, the time interval between two\nevents, and even whether or not two events are simultaneous, depends on the\nobserver\'s reference frame. By an event, which we use a lot here, we mean some-\nthing that happens at a particular place and at a particular time.\nTwo events are said to occur simultaneously if they occur at exactly the same\ntime. But how do we know if two events occur precisely at the same time? If they\noccur at the same point in space-such as two apples falling on your head at the\nsame time-it is easy. But if the two events occur at widely separated places, it is\nmore difficult to know whether the events are simultaneous since we have to take\ninto account the time it takes for the light from them to reach us. Because light\ntravels at finite speed, a person who sees two events must calculate back to find\nout when they actually occurred. For example, if two events are observed to\noccur at the same time, but one actually took place farther from the observer\nthan the other, then the more distant one must have occurred earlier, and the two\nevents were not simultaneous.\n4\nO\nA\nFIGURE 26-3 A moment after\nlightning strikes at points A and B, the\npulses of light (shown as blue waves)\nare traveling toward the observer O,\nbut O "sees" the lightning only when\nthe light reaches O.\nB\nLight coming from\nthe two events\nat A and B\nWe now imagine a simple thought experiment. Assume an observer, called O,\nis located exactly halfway between points A and B where two events occur,\nFig. 26-3. Suppose the two events are lightning that strikes the points A and B, as\nshown. For brief events like lightning, only short pulses of light (blue in\nFig. 26-3) will travel outward from A and B and reach O. Observer O "sees" the\nevents when the pulses of light reach point O. If the two pulses reach O at the\nsame time, then the two events had to be simultaneous. This is because (i) the two\nlight pulses travel at the same speed (postulate 2), and (ii) the distance OA\nequals OB, so the time for the light to travel from A to O and from B to O must\nbe the same. Observer O can then definitely state that the two events occurred\nsimultaneously. On the other hand, if O sees the light from one event before that\nfrom the other, then the former event occurred first.\nThe question we really want to examine is this: if two events are simultaneous\nto an observer in one reference frame, are they also simultaneous to another\nobserver moving with respect to the first? Let us call the observers O1 and O2\nand assume they are fixed in reference frames 1 and 2 that move with speed v\nrelative to one another. These two reference frames can be thought of as two\nrockets or two trains (Fig. 26-4). O2 says that O1 is moving to the right with speed v,\nas in Fig. 26-4a; and O1 says O2 is moving to the left with speed v, as in Fig. 26-4b.\nBoth viewpoints are legitimate according to the relativity principle. [There is no\nthird point of view that will tell us which one is "really" moving.]\nFIGURE 26-4 Observers O1 and O2,\non two different trains (two different\nreference frames), are moving with\nrelative speed v. (a) O2 says that O1\nis moving to the right. (b) O1 says\nthat O2 is moving to the left. Both\nviewpoints are legitimate: it all\ndepends on your reference frame.\nB\n01·\nv\n02°\n(a)\nB\nv\n·01\n·02\n(b)\nSECTION 26-3 Simultaneity\n749\n', 'chapter_title': 'The Special Theory of Relativity'}, {'page_number': 7, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Now suppose that observers O1 and O2 observe and measure two lightning\nstrikes.

For simplicity, we assume that\nO1 is exactly halfway between A1 and B1, and O2 is halfway between A2 and B2 .\nLet us first put ourselves in O2\'s reference frame, so we observe O1 moving to the\nright with speed v. Let us also assume that the two events occur simultaneously in O2\'s\nframe, and just at the instant when O1 and O2 are opposite each other, Fig. 26-5a.\nA short time later, Fig. 26-5b, light from A2 and from B2 reach O2 at the same time\n(we assumed this).

As shown in Fig. 26-5b,\nwe can see from our O2 reference frame that the light from B1 has already\npassed O1, whereas the light from A1 has not yet reached O1 . That is, O1 observes\nthe light coming from B1 before observing the light coming from A1. Given\n(i) that light travels at the same speed c in any direction and in any reference\nframe, and (ii) that the distance O1 A1 equals O1 B1, then observer O1 can only\nconclude that the event at B1 occurred before the event at A1 . The two events are\nnot simultaneous for O1, even though they are for O2 .\nWe thus find that two events which take place at different locations and are\nsimultaneous to one observer, are actually not simultaneous to a second observer\nwho moves relative to the first.\nIt may be tempting to ask: "Which observer is right, O1 or O2?" The answer,\naccording to relativity, is that they are both right. There is no "best" reference\nframe we can choose to determine which observer is right. Both frames are\nequally good. We can only conclude that simultaneity is not an absolute concept,\nbut is relative. We are not aware of this lack of agreement on simultaneity in\neveryday life because the effect is noticeable only when the relative speed of the\ntwo reference frames is very large (near c), or the distances involved are very large.\n26-4 Time Dilation and the Twin Paradox\nThe fact that two events simultaneous to one observer may not be simultaneous\nto a second observer suggests that time itself is not absolute. Could it be that time\npasses differently in one reference frame than in another? This is, indeed, just what\nEinstein\'s theory of relativity predicts, as the following thought experiment shows.\nFigure 26-6 shows a spaceship traveling past Earth at high speed. The point\nof view of an observer on the spaceship is shown in part (a), and that of an observer\non Earth in part (b). Both observers have accurate clocks. The person on the space-\nship (Fig. 26-6a) flashes a light and measures the time it takes the light to travel\ndirectly across the spaceship and return after reflecting from a mirror (the rays are\ndrawn at a slight angle for clarity). In the reference frame of the spaceship, the\n750 CHAPTER 26 The Special Theory of Relativity\n', 'chapter_title': 'The Special Theory of Relativity'}, {'page_number': 8, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'Mirror\nD\n(a)\nVD2 + 12\nLight\nsource\nReceiver\nClock timer\nVD2 + 02\nFIGURE 26-6 Time dilation can be\nshown by a thought experiment: the\ntime it takes for light to travel across\na spaceship and back is longer for the\nobserver on Earth (b) than for the\nobserver on the spaceship (a).\n1\nD\n1\n-\n0\nl\nl\n4\n(b)\nEarth\nlight travels a distance 2D at speed c, Fig. 26-6a; so the time required to go across\nand back, Ato , is\n2D\nAto =\nThe observer on Earth, Fig. 26-6b, observes the same process. But to this\nobserver, the spaceship is moving. So the light travels the diagonal path shown\ngoing across the spaceship, reflecting off the mirror, and returning to the sender.\nAlthough the light travels at the same speed to this observer (the second postulate),\nit travels a greater distance. Hence the time required, as measured by the observer\non Earth, will be greater than that measured by the observer on the spaceship.\nLet us determine the time interval At measured by the observer on Earth\nbetween sending and receiving the light. In time At, the spaceship travels\na distance 20 = v At where v is the speed of the spaceship (Fig. 26-6b). The\nlight travels a total distance on its diagonal path (Pythagorean theorem) of\n2VD2 + 2 = c At, where & = v At/2. Therefore\nc At = 2VD2 + 2 = 2VD2 + 2 (At) 2/4 .\nWe square both sides to find c2(At)2 = 4D2 + v2(At)2, and solve for (At)2:\n(At)2 = 4D2/(c2 - 22)\nSO\nAt =\n2D\nCV1 - 02/c2\n.\nWe combine this equation for At with the formula for Ato above, Ato = 2D/c:\n△to\n11 - 02/c2\n.\n(26-1a)\nTIME DILATION\nSince \\1 - v2/c2 is always less than 1, we see that At > Ato. That is, the time\ninterval between the two events (the sending of the light, and its reception on the\nspaceship) is greater for the observer on Earth than for the observer on the space-\nship. This is a general result of the theory of relativity, and is known as time dilation.\nThe time dilation effect can be stated as\nclocks moving relative to an observer are measured to run more slowly, as\ncompared to clocks at rest.\nHowever, we should not think that the clocks are somehow at fault.\nTime is actually measured to pass more slowly in any moving reference frame\nas compared to your own.\nThis remarkable result is an inevitable outcome of the two postulates of the special\ntheory of relativity.\nSECTION 26-4 Time Dilation and the Twin Paradox 751\n', 'chapter_title': 'The Special Theory of Relativity'}, {'page_number': 9, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'TABLE 26-1 Values of Y\n£\nG\n0\n1.00000 ...\n0.01c\n1.00005\n0.10c\n1.005\n0.50c\n1.15\n0.90c\n2.3\n0.99c\n7.1\nThe factor 1/1/1 - v2/c2 occurs so often in relativity that we often give it\nthe shorthand symbol Y (the Greek letter "gamma"), and write Eq. 26-1a as\n(26-1b)\nAt = Y Ato\n1\n(26-2)\nwhere\nY =\nV1 - 02/c2\n.\nNote that Y is never less than one, and has no units.

In general, Y ≥ 1.\nValues for Y = 1/11 - v2/c2 at a few speeds v are given in Table 26-1.\nY is never less than 1.00 and exceeds 1.00 significantly only at very high speeds,\nmuch above let\'s say 106 m/s (for which Y = 1.000006 ).\nThe concept of time dilation may be hard to accept, for it contradicts our\nexperience. We can see from Eq. 26-1 that the time dilation effect is indeed negli-\ngible unless v is reasonably close to c. If v is much less than c, then the term v2 /c2\nis much smaller than the 1 in the denominator of Eq. 26-1, and then At ~ Ato\n(see Example 26-2). The speeds we experience in everyday life are much smaller\nthan c, so it is little wonder we don\'t ordinarily notice time dilation. But experiments\nthat have tested the time dilation effect have confirmed Einstein\'s predictions.\nIn 1971, for example, extremely precise atomic clocks were flown around the Earth\nin jet planes. The speed of the planes (103 km/h) was much less than c, so the clocks\nhad to be accurate to nanoseconds (10-9 s) in order to detect any time dilation.\nThey were this accurate, and they confirmed Eqs. 26-1 to within experimental error.\nTime dilation had been confirmed decades earlier, however, by observations on\n"elementary particles" which have very small masses (typically 10-30 to 10-27 kg) and\nso require little energy to be accelerated to speeds close to the speed of light, c.\nMany of these elementary particles are not stable and decay after a time into\nlighter particles. One example is the muon, whose mean lifetime is 2.2 us when at\nrest. Careful experiments showed that when a muon is traveling at high speeds,\nits lifetime is measured to be longer than when it is at rest, just as predicted by the\ntime dilation formula.\nEXAMPLE 26-1\nLifetime of a moving muon. (a) What will be the mean\nlifetime of a muon as measured in the laboratory if it is traveling at\nv= 0.60c = 1.80 × 108 m/s with respect to the laboratory? A muon\'s mean\nlifetime at rest is 2.20 us = 2.20 × 10-6 s. (b) How far does a muon travel in the\nlaboratory, on average, before decaying?\nAPPROACH If an observer were to move along with the muon (the muon would\nbe at rest to this observer), the muon would have a mean life of 2.20 × 10-6 s. To\nan observer in the lab, the muon lives longer because of time dilation. We find the\nmean lifetime using Eq. 26-1 and the average distance using d = v At.\nSOLUTION (a) From Eq. 26-1 with v = 0.60c, we have\nAt =\n△to\nV1 - 02/c2\n=\n2.20 × 10-6 s\n=\n2.20 × 10-6 s\n10.64\n11-0.36c2/c2\n= 2.8×10-6 s.\n(b) Relativity predicts that a muon with speed 1.80 × 108 m/s would travel an\naverage distance d = v At = (1.80 × 108m/s)(2.8 × 10-6s) = 500 m, and this\nis the distance that is measured experimentally in the laboratory.\nNOTE At a speed of 1.8 × 108 m/s, classical physics would tell us that\nwith a mean life of 2.2 us, an average muon would travel d = vt =\n(1.8×108m/s)(2.2×10-6s) = 400 m. This is shorter than the distance measured.\nEXERCISE A What is the muon\'s mean lifetime (Example 26-1) if it is traveling at\nv = 0.90c? (a) 0.42 us; (b) 2.3 us; (c) 5.0 us; (d) 5.3 us; (e) 12.0 us.\n752 CHAPTER 26 The Special Theory of Relativity\n', 'chapter_title': 'The Special Theory of Relativity'}, {'page_number': 10, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'We need to clarify how to use Eq. 26-1, At = Y Ato, and the meaning of At\nand Ato . The equation is true only when Ato represents the time interval between\nthe two events in a reference frame where an observer at rest sees the two events\noccur at the same point in space (as in Fig. 26-6a where the two events are the\nlight flash being sent and being received). This time interval, Ato, is called the\nproper time. Then At in Eqs. 26-1 represents the time interval between the two\nevents as measured in a reference frame moving with speed v with respect to the\nfirst. In Example 26-1 above, Ato (and not At) was set equal to 2.2 × 10-6 s\nbecause it is only in the rest frame of the muon that the two events ("birth" and\n"decay") occur at the same point in space. The proper time Ato is the shortest time\nbetween the events any observer can measure.

Let us check time dilation for\neveryday speeds. A car traveling 100 km/h covers a certain distance in 10.00 s\naccording to the driver\'s watch. What does an observer at rest on Earth measure\nfor the time interval?\nAPPROACH The car\'s speed relative to Earth, written in meters per second,\nis 100 km/h = (1.00× 105 m)/(3600 s) = 27.8 m/s. The driver is at rest in the\nreference frame of the car, so we set Ato = 10.00 s in the time dilation\nformula.\nSOLUTION We use Eq. 26-1a:\nAt =\n22\n1 -\n2\nAto\n=\n10.00 s\n27.8 m/s\n3.00 × 108 m/s\n≤\nV\n1 -\n10.00 s\n11 - (8.59 ×10-15)\n.\n=\nIf you put these numbers into a calculator, you will obtain At = 10.00 s, because\nthe denominator differs from 1 by such a tiny amount. The time measured by an\nobserver fixed on Earth would show no difference from that measured by the\ndriver, even with the best instruments. A computer that could calculate to a large\nnumber of decimal places would reveal a slight difference between At and Ato ·\nNOTE We can estimate the difference using the binomial expansion (Appendix A-5),\n(1 + x)" ~ 1 + nx.\n[for x << 1]\nIn our time dilation formula, we have the factor Y = (1 - 02/c2) 2.

A passenger on a\nfictional high-speed spaceship traveling between Earth and Jupiter at a steady\nspeed of 0.75c reads a magazine which takes 10.0 min according to her watch.\n(a) How long does this take as measured by Earth-based clocks? (b) How much\nfarther is the spaceship from Earth at the end of reading the article than it\nwas at the beginning?\nAPPROACH (a) The time interval in one reference frame is related to the time\ninterval in the other by Eq. 26-1a or b. (b) At constant speed, distance is\nspeed X time. Because there are two time intervals (At and Ato) we will get\ntwo distances, one for each reference frame. [This surprising result is explored\nin the next Section (26-5).]\nSOLUTION (a) The given 10.0-min time interval is the proper time Ato-starting\nand finishing the magazine happen at the same place on the spaceship. Earth\nclocks measure\nAt =\nVI - (2/c2)\n11 - (0.75)2\n△to\n=\n10.00 min\n15.1 min.\n(b) In the Earth frame, the rocket travels a distance D = v At =\n(0.75c)(15.1 min) = (0.75)(3.0×108 m/s)(15.1 min × 60 s/min) = 2.04×1011 m.\nIn the spaceship's frame, the Earth is moving away from the spaceship at 0.75c,\nbut the time is only 10.0 min, so the distance is measured to be Do = v Ato =\n(2.25 × 108 m/s)(600 s) = 1.35 × 1011 m.\nSpace Travel?\nTime dilation has aroused interesting speculation about space travel. According\nto classical (Newtonian) physics, to reach a star 100 light-years away would not\nbe possible for ordinary mortals (1 light-year is the distance light can travel\nin 1 year = 3.0 × 108 m/s × 3.16× 107 s= 9.5× 1015 m). Even if a spaceship\ncould travel at close to the speed of light, it would take over 100 years to reach\nsuch a star. But time dilation tells us that the time involved could be less. In\na spaceship traveling at v = 0.999c, the time for such a trip would be only about\nAto = At V1 - 02/c2 = (100 yr) \\1 - (0.999)2 = 4.5 yr. Thus time dilation\nallows such a trip, but the enormous practical problems of achieving such speeds\nmay not be possible to overcome, certainly not in the near future.\nWhen we talk in this Chapter and in the Problems about spaceships moving\nat speeds close to c, it is for understanding and for fun, but not realistic, although\nfor tiny elementary particles such high speeds are realistic.\nIn this example, 100 years would pass on Earth, whereas only 4.5 years would\npass for the astronaut on the trip. Is it just the clocks that would slow down for the\nastronaut? No.\nAll processes, including aging and other life processes, run more slowly for\nthe astronaut as measured by an Earth observer. But to the astronaut, time\nwould pass in a normal way.\nThe astronaut would experience 4.5 years of normal sleeping, eating, reading,\nand so on. And people on Earth would experience 100 years of ordinary activity.\nTwin Paradox\nNot long after Einstein proposed the special theory of relativity, an apparent\nparadox was pointed out. According to this twin paradox, suppose one of a pair\nof 20-year-old twins takes off in a spaceship traveling at very high speed to a\ndistant star and back again, while the other twin remains on Earth. According to\nthe Earth twin, the astronaut twin will age less. Whereas 20 years might pass for\nthe Earth twin, perhaps only 1 year (depending on the spacecraft's speed) would\npass for the traveler. Thus, when the traveler returns, the earthbound twin could\nexpect to be 40 years old whereas the traveling twin would be only 21.\n754 CHAPTER 26 The Special Theory of Relativity\n", 'chapter_title': 'The Special Theory of Relativity'}, {'page_number': 12, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'This is the viewpoint of the twin on the Earth. But what about the traveling\ntwin? If all inertial reference frames are equally good, won\'t the traveling twin\nmake all the claims the Earth twin does, only in reverse? Can\'t the astronaut twin\nclaim that since the Earth is moving away at high speed, time passes more slowly\non Earth and the twin on Earth will age less? This is the opposite of what the\nEarth twin predicts. They cannot both be right, for after all the spacecraft returns\nto Earth and a direct comparison of ages and clocks can be made.\nThere is, however, no contradiction here. One of the viewpoints is indeed\nincorrect. The consequences of the special theory of relativity-in this case, time\ndilation-can be applied only by observers in an inertial reference frame. The\nEarth is such a frame (or nearly so), whereas the spacecraft is not. The spacecraft\naccelerates at the start and end of its trip and when it turns around at the far\npoint of its journey. Part of the time, the astronaut twin may be in an inertial\nframe (and is justified in saying the Earth twin\'s clocks run slow). But during the\naccelerations, the twin on the spacecraft is not in an inertial frame. So she cannot\nuse special relativity to predict their relative ages when she returns to Earth. The\nEarth twin stays in the same inertial frame, and we can thus trust her predictions\nbased on special relativity. Thus, there is no paradox. The prediction of the Earth\ntwin that the traveling twin ages less is the correct one.\n* Global Positioning System (GPS)\nAirplanes, cars, boats, and hikers use global positioning system (GPS) receivers\nto tell them quite accurately where they are at a given moment (Fig. 26-7). There are\nmore than 30 global positioning system satellites that send out precise time signals\nusing atomic clocks. Your receiver compares the times received from at least four\nsatellites, all of whose times are carefully synchronized to within 1 part in 1013.\nBy comparing the time differences with the known satellite positions and the\nfixed speed of light, the receiver can determine how far it is from each satellite\nand thus where it is on the Earth. It can do this to an accuracy of a few meters, if\nit has been constructed to make corrections such as the one below due to relativity.\nCONCEPTUAL EXAMPLE 26-4\nA relativity correction to GPS. GPS\nsatellites move at about 4 km/s = 4000 m/s. Show that a good GPS receiver\nneeds to correct for time dilation if it is to produce results consistent with atomic\nclocks accurate to 1 part in 1013.\nRESPONSE Let us calculate the magnitude of the time dilation effect by\ninserting v = 4000 m/s into Eq. 26-1a:\n1\nAt =\n1\nAto =\nv2\n1\n1 -\n1 -\n4 × 103 m/s\n2\nAto\nC2\n1\n3 × 108 m/s\n1\n△to -\n=\n1/1 - 1.8× 10-10\nWe use the binomial expansion: (1 + x)" ~ 1 + nx for x << 1 (see Appendix A-5)\nwhich here is (1 - x)-2 ~ 1 + 2x.

In this\nframe of reference, the spaceship is at rest; Earth and Neptune move* with speed v.\nThe time between departure of Earth and arrival of Neptune, as observed from the\nspacecraft, is the "proper time" Ato (page 753), because these two events occur\nat the same point in space (i.e., at the spacecraft). Therefore the time interval is\nless for the spacecraft observers than for the Earth observers.

The length lo in Eqs. 26-3 is called the\nproper length. It is the length of the object (or distance between two points whose\npositions are measured at the same time) as determined by observers at rest with\nrespect to the object.

Observers on the train measure the train\'s length\nto be 500 m and the tunnel\'s length to be only 80 m (Exercise C, using Eq. 26-3a).\nClearly a 500-m-long train cannot fit inside an 80-m-long tunnel.

Let the engine emerging from one end of the tunnel be "event A,"\nand the last car disappearing into the other end of the tunnel "event B." To\nobservers in the Earth frame, events A and B are simultaneous. To observers on\nthe train, however, the events are not simultaneous. In the train\'s frame, event A\noccurs before event B.

This person begins a meal at 7:00 and finishes at 7:15, according to\na clock on the train. The two events, beginning and ending the meal, take place at\nthe same point on the train, so the "proper time" between these two events is\n15 min. To observers on Earth, the plate is moving and the meal will take\nlonger-20 min according to Eqs. 26-1. Let us assume that the meal was served\non a 20-cm-diameter plate (its "proper length"). To observers on the Earth, the\nplate is moving and is only 15 cm wide (length contraction). Thus, to observers on\nthe Earth, the meal looks smaller but lasts longer.\n7\n7\nFIGURE 26-10 According to an\naccurate clock on a fast-moving train,\na person (a) begins dinner at 7:00 and\n(b) finishes at 7:15. At the beginning\nof the meal, two observers on Earth\nset their watches to correspond with\nthe clock on the train. These observers\nmeasure the eating time as 20 minutes.\n(a)\n(b)\nIn a sense the two effects, time dilation and length contraction, balance each\nother. When viewed from the Earth, what an object seems to lose in size it gains\nin length of time it lasts. Space, or length, is exchanged for time.\nConsiderations like this led to the idea of four-dimensional space-time:\nspace takes up three dimensions and time is a fourth dimension. Space and time\nare intimately connected. Just as when we squeeze a balloon we make one\ndimension larger and another smaller, so when we examine objects and events\nfrom different reference frames, a certain amount of space is exchanged for time,\nor vice versa.\n758 CHAPTER 26 The Special Theory of Relativity\n', 'chapter_title': 'The Special Theory of Relativity'}, {'page_number': 16, 'type': 'text', 'content': "Although the idea of four dimensions may seem strange, it refers to the idea\nthat any object or event is specified by four quantities-three to describe where\nin space, and one to describe when in time.

We might expect\nthat other physical quantities might need some modification according to the\ntheory of relativity, such as momentum and energy.\nThe analysis of collisions between two particles shows that if we want to\npreserve the law of conservation of momentum in relativity, we must redefine\nmomentum as\nmv\n= Ymv.\np\nV1 - 02/c2\n(26-4)\nHere Y is shorthand for 1/1/1 - v2/c2 as before (Eq. 26-2).

In this interpretation, a particle\ncan have a relativistic mass, mrel , which increases with speed according to\nmrel\nV1 - 02/2\nm\n.\nIn this "mass-increase" formula, m is referred to as the rest mass of the object.\nWith this interpretation, the mass of an object appears to increase as its speed\nincreases. But there are problems with relativistic mass. If we plug it into formu-\nlas like F = ma or KE = 2mv2, we obtain formulas that do not agree with\nexperiment. (If we write Newton\'s second law in its more general form, F = Ap/At,\nthat would get a correct result.) Also, be careful not to think a mass acquires\nmore particles or more molecules as its speed becomes very large. It doesn\'t.\nToday, most physicists prefer not to use relativistic mass, so an object has only\none mass (its rest mass), and it is only the momentum that increases with speed.\nWhenever we talk about the mass of an object, we will always mean its rest\nmass (a fixed value). [But see Problem 39.]\n26-8 The Ultimate Speed\nA basic result of the special theory of relativity is that the speed of an object\ncannot equal or exceed the speed of light. That the speed of light is a natural\nspeed limit in the universe can be seen from any of Eqs. 26-1, 26-3, or 26-4. It is\nperhaps easiest to see from Eq. 26-4. As an object is accelerated to greater and\ngreater speeds, its momentum becomes larger and larger. Indeed, if v were to\nequal c, the denominator in this equation would be zero, and the momentum\nwould be infinite. To accelerate an object up to v = c would thus require infinite\nenergy, and so is not possible.\n26-9 E = mc2; Mass and Energy\nIf momentum needs to be modified to fit with relativity as we just saw in Eq. 26-4,\nthen we might expect that energy would also need to be rethought. Indeed, Einstein\nnot only developed a new formula for kinetic energy, but also found a new rela-\ntion between mass and energy, and the startling idea that mass is a form of energy.\nWe start with the work-energy principle (Chapter 6), hoping it is still valid in\nrelativity and will give verifiable results. That is, we assume the net work done on\na particle is equal to its change in kinetic energy (KE). Using this principle, Einstein\nshowed that at high speeds the formula KE = 2mv2 is not correct. Instead,\nEinstein showed that the kinetic energy of a particle of mass m traveling at speed v\nis given by\nKE =\nmc2\nV1 - 02/c2\n- mc2.\n(26-5a)\nIn terms of Y = 1/1/1 - v2/c2 we can rewrite Eq. 26-5a as\nKE = Ymc2 - mc2 = (Y - 1)mc2.\n(26-5b)\nEquation 26-5a requires some interpretation. The first term increases with the\nspeed v of the particle. The second term, mc2, is constant; it is called the rest energy\nof the particle, and represents a form of energy that a particle has even when at rest.\nNote that if a particle is at rest (v = 0) the first term in Eq. 26-5a becomes mc2,\nSO KE = 0 as it should.\n760 CHAPTER 26 The Special Theory of Relativity\n', 'chapter_title': 'The Special Theory of Relativity'}, {'page_number': 18, 'type': 'text', 'content': 'We can rearrange Eq. 26-5b to get\nYmc2 = mc2 + KE.\nWe call Ymc2 the total energy E of the particle (assuming no potential energy),\nbecause it equals the rest energy plus the kinetic energy:\nE = KE + mc2.\n(26-6a)\nThe total energyt can also be written, using Eqs. 26-5, as\n(26-6b)\nE = Ymc2 =\nmc2\nV1 - 02/c2\n.\nFor a particle at rest in a given reference frame, KE is zero in Eq. 26-6a, so\nthe total energy is its rest energy:\nE = mc2.\n(26-7)\nHere we have Einstein\'s famous formula, E = mc2. This formula mathematically\nrelates the concepts of energy and mass. But if this idea is to have any physical\nmeaning, then mass ought to be convertible to other forms of energy and vice\nversa. Einstein suggested that this might be possible, and indeed changes of mass\nto other forms of energy, and vice versa, have been experimentally confirmed\ncountless times in nuclear and elementary particle physics. For example, an elec-\ntron and a positron (= a positive electron, see Section 32-3) have often been\nobserved to collide and disappear, producing pure electromagnetic radiation. The\namount of electromagnetic energy produced is found to be exactly equal to that\npredicted by Einstein\'s formula, E = mc2. The reverse process is also commonly\nobserved in the laboratory: electromagnetic radiation under certain conditions can\nbe converted into material particles such as electrons (see Section 27-6 on pair\nproduction). On a larger scale, the energy produced in nuclear power plants is\na result of the loss in mass of the uranium fuel as it undergoes the process called\nfission (Chapter 31). Even the radiant energy we receive from the Sun is an\nexample of E = mc2; the Sun\'s mass is continually decreasing as it radiates\nelectromagnetic energy outward.\nThe relation E = mc2 is now believed to apply to all processes, although the\nchanges are often too small to measure. That is, when the energy of a system\nchanges by an amount AE, the mass of the system changes by an amount Am\ngiven by\nAE = (Am)(c2).\n(26-8)\nIn a nuclear reaction where an energy E is required or released, the masses of the\nreactants and the products will be different by Am = AE/c2.\nEXAMPLE 26-9\nPion\'s kinetic energy.

Since the mass m of a given\nparticle is the same in any reference frame, we see that the quantity E2 - p2c2\nmust also be the same in any reference frame. Thus, at any given moment the\ntotal energy E and momentum p of a particle will be different in different\nreference frames, but the quantity E2 - p2c2 will have the same value in all\ninertial reference frames. We say that the quantity E2 - p2c2 is invariant.\nWhen Do We Use Relativistic Formulas?\nFrom a practical point of view, we do not have much opportunity in our daily lives\nto use the mathematics of relativity.

Within experimental error, no contradictions have been found.\nScientists have therefore accepted relativity as an accurate description of nature.\nAt speeds much less than the speed of light, the relativistic formulas reduce to\nthe old classical ones, as we have discussed. We would, of course, hope-or rather,\ninsist-that this be true since Newtonian mechanics works so well for objects\nmoving with speeds v << c. This insistence that a more general theory (such as\nrelativity) give the same results as a more restricted theory (such as classical\nmechanics which works for v << c) is called the correspondence principle. The\ntwo theories must correspond where their realms of validity overlap. Relativity\nthus does not contradict classical mechanics. Rather, it is a more general theory,\nof which classical mechanics is now considered to be a limiting case.\nThe importance of relativity is not simply that it gives more accurate results,\nespecially at very high speeds. Much more than that, it has changed the way we\nview the world. The concepts of space and time are now seen to be relative, and\nintertwined with one another, whereas before they were considered absolute and\nseparate. Even our concepts of matter and energy have changed: either can be\nconverted to the other. The impact of relativity extends far beyond physics. It has\ninfluenced the other sciences, and even the world of art and literature; it has,\nindeed, entered the general culture.\nThe special theory of relativity we have studied in this Chapter deals with\ninertial (nonaccelerating) reference frames. In Chapter 33 we will discuss briefly\nthe more complicated "general theory of relativity" which can deal with non-\ninertial reference frames.\nSummary\nAn inertial reference frame is one in which Newton\'s law of\ninertia holds. Inertial reference frames move at constant veloc-\nity relative to one another. Accelerating reference frames are\nnoninertial.\nThe special theory of relativity is based on two principles:\nthe relativity principle, which states that the laws of physics\nare the same in all inertial reference frames, and the principle\nof the constancy of the speed of light, which states that the\nspeed of light in empty space has the same value in all inertial\nreference frames.\nOne consequence of relativity theory is that two events\nthat are simultaneous in one reference frame may not be simul-\ntaneous in another. Other effects are time dilation: moving\nclocks are measured to run slow; and length contraction:\nthe length of a moving object is measured to be shorter (in its\ndirection of motion) than when it is at rest. Quantitatively,\nAt =\nV1- 02/c2\nAto\n= Y Ato\n(26-1)\n(26-3)\nwhere l and At are the length and time interval of objects (or\nevents) observed as they move by at the speed v; lo and Ato are\nthe proper length and proper time-that is, the same quantities\nas measured in the rest frame of the objects or events. The\nquantity Y is shorthand for\n1\n.\nY =\nV1 - 02/c2\n(26-2)\nThe theory of relativity has changed our notions of space\nand time, and of momentum, energy, and mass. Space and time\nare seen to be intimately connected, with time being the fourth\ndimension in addition to the three dimensions of space.\nThe momentum of an object is given by\np = Ymv\nV1 - 02/2\nmv\n.\n(26-4)\nMass and energy are interconvertible. The equation\nE = mc2\n(26-7)\ntells how much energy E is needed to create a mass m, or vice\nversa. Said another way, E = mc2 is the amount of energy an\nobject has because of its mass m. The law of conservation of\nenergy must include mass as a form of energy.\nThe kinetic energy KE of an object moving at speed v is\ngiven by\nmc2\nKE =\nV1 - 02/c2\n- mc2 = (y-1)mc2 (26-5)\n1 = 10 V1 - 2/2 =\nla\ng\nwhere m is the mass of the object. The total energy E, if there\nis no potential energy, is\nE = KE + mc2\n= Ymc2.\n(26-6)\nThe momentum p of an object is related to its total\nenergy E (assuming no potential energy) by\nE2 = p2c2 + m2c4.\n(26-9)\nVelocity addition also must be done in a special way.
